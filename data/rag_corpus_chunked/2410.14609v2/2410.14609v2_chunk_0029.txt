appear to have a better trade-off when it comes to efficiency. Finally, DiSCo Fusion has the best performance overall, without an important computational overload compared DiSCo: LLM Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Sparse Retrieval in Conversational Search SIGIR ’25, July 13–18, 2025, Padua, Italy avgq_len37.0avgq_len22.7 Figure 5: Effectiveness-efficiency trade-off on TopiOCQA.

Note that retrieval is not optimized, and libraries such as PISA could reduce retrieval of SPLADE models below 100 ms on CPU, as shown in recent papers [27, 30, 32]. This would further increase the efficiency gap between rewrite-based and distillation-based approaches. We also focus here on inference efficiency, as training efficiency does not directly affect the user, and would involve training LLMs. Those results provide a first answer to RQ4 on the efficiency of DiSCo compared to existing methods. Controlling Sparsity. We then focus here on the sparsity of the sparse representations, as a measure of efficiency within the in- verted index. Figure 5 plots the performance and FLOPs of several DiSCo models when trained with different levels of sparsity. This is possible thanks to the regularization loss from the SPLADE archi- tecture, controlled by the hyper-parameters (𝜆𝑞, 𝜆𝑑 ) [17]. From the Figure, we see for example that the same DiSCo T5 model can be trained with different degrees of regularization, leading to different FLOPs and MRR. Furthermore, Figure 5 shows the FLOPs of the as- sociated teacher models: SPLADE MistralQR and T5QR. We notice that our student DiSCo models are more sparse compared to their teachers, as having only a constraint on similarities during train- ing allows more freedom on the representations and their sparsity.
