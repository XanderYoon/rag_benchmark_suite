Then the student query encoder ˜𝐸𝑞 is trained to reproduce the output scores of the teacher. the rewritten queries: ˜𝐸𝑞 (𝑞𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣 ) → 𝐸𝑞 (𝑞𝑟 𝑤) . (1) Relaxation of the distillation. In our work, we propose to dis- till the scores rather than the representations. This allows for a relaxation of the training objective. Instead of forcing ˜𝐸𝑞 (𝑞𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣 ) to converge to 𝐸𝑞 (𝑞𝑟 𝑤), we allow the entire hyperplane on which the similarity for 𝑞𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣 and 𝑞𝑟 𝑤 with an anchor document 𝑑 is equal: ˜𝐸𝑞 (𝑞𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣 ) → { 𝑋 ∈ Rℎ | 𝑋 ⊤𝐸𝑑 (𝑑) = 𝑠𝑞𝑟 𝑤 } , (2) with targeted scores 𝑠𝑞𝑟 𝑤 = 𝐸𝑞 (𝑞𝑟 𝑤)⊤𝐸𝑑 (𝑑), and ℎ the dimension of the representation space. More intuitively, while the existing dis- tillation loss functions bound the model to converge to one single embedding [65], our loss allows for infinite possible optimum em- beddings, as long as they have the same dot product with the target relevant document embedding (i.e., any point in the hyperplane). Such distillation on scores can be trained with a Kullback Leibler Divergence loss [25] on the distribution of scores: LKLD = 𝐷KL (S𝑞𝑟 𝑤 || S𝑞𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣 ) , (3) where S𝑞𝑟 𝑤 and S𝑞𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣 are the distributions of similarity scores within the batch. It differs from the existing learning objective which is achieved with an MSE loss on each dimension
