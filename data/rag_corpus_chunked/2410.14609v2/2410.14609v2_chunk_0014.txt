LLMs or humans possible. We do so by averaging the similarity scores of the 𝑇 teachers, each having a different rewrite, thus a different similarity with the documents. We experimented with mean, min, and max aggregation methods, observing no significant differences in performance, and thus decided to use the more simple mean aggregation. Overall, the distilled score is: 𝑠𝑞𝑟 𝑤𝑎𝑙𝑙 = 𝑠𝑞rw1 + 𝑠𝑞rw2 + · · · +𝑠𝑞rw𝑇 𝑇 . (6) The final learning objective of our DiSCo multi-teacher is the same as for the regular DiSCo (i.e., KLD from Equation 3), but distilling the average score of the set of teachers, instead of using a single similarity from a unique teacher. Student-Teacher Fusion. Finally, we propose a fusion of the teacher and the student model, combining the ranked lists of both at inference. This is achieved using an average normalized score over the ranked list of both models. 4 Experiments Design 4.1 Datasets and Metrics Datasets. We evaluate our method’s effectiveness on various con- versational passage retrieval datasets, detailed in Table 1, namely: • QReCC [4] is built upon ORConvQA [53], NQ [26] and TREC CAsT 2019 [ 10]. It features 13K conversations and 80K turns created by human annotators around existing documents. • TopiOCQA [2] distinguishes itself from QReCC focusing on topic switches, where every Wikipedia hyperlink is considered a DiSCo: LLM Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Sparse Retrieval in Conversational Search SIGIR ’25, July 13–18, 2025, Padua, Italy Table 1: Statistics of the datasets.
