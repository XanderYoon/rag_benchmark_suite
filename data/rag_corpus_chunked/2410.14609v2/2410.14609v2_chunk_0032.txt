Our findings emphasize the importance of aligning the rewriting and retrieval tasks in CS, with training objectives that unify both tasks. As a future work, we plan to study different teachers, as any model pro- ducing a similarity score could be distilled, e.g., cross-encoder [20], paired with stronger LLMs for rewrite.
