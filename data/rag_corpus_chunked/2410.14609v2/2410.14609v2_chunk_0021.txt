the relaxed distillation affect the efficiency and sparsity of the student models? 5.1 Performance Comparison In this first subsection, we aim to answerRQ1 and RQ2 by compar- ing the performance of our proposed DiSCo with state-of-the-art query rewriting, and distillation-based methods. We first compare the performance of DiSCo in the in-domain and out-of-domain retrieval setups in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. The tables report the performance of diverse baselines in terms of various metrics, as well as the number of LLM calls every model requires at inference. This is an important factor while comparing the performance of conver- sational retrieval models for various reasons, namely, (i) LLM call leads to considerable inference latency, delaying inferencing from hundreds of milliseconds to seconds; and (ii) LLM-based methods take advantage of the vast parameter size and knowledge learned by the training of the LLMs, making their comparison to other smaller models unfair. In-domain retrieval. Trying to address RQ1, we report in Table 3 in-domain performance on TopiOCQA and QReCC. Looking at the results, we do not observe a big gap between the rewriting and distillation-based methods, even though the rewriting-based methods make use of the LLM knowledge in the rewriting phase.
