Existing loss functions bound representation of the full conversation rep- resentation to converge to a single rewrite representation (convDR, red arrow), while if we consider document d as anchor, an infinite number of representations, other than Eq (qrw), have the same similarity with d (Y, blue hyperplane).

The goal of the CS task is to retrieve relevant documents from a corpus within a conversational context, in response to the user’s latest utterance. While sharing similarities with ad-hoc retrieval, the main challenge ofCS remains to model the conversational context [8, 54, 64]. More specifically, as the
