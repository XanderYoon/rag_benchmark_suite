popular types of retrieval methods are lexical matching (Zhai, 2008; Robertson et al., 2009) and dense retrieval (Su et al., 2023b; Gao and Callan, 2021; Su et al., 2023a; Muennighoff, 2022; Li et al., 2023b; Ma et al., 2023; Ye et al., 2024; Su et al., 2023c; Li et al., 2023a; Chen et al., 2023, 2022; Li et al., 2023c; Fang et al., 2024). Among lexi- cal matching techniques, BM25 stands out for its widespread adoption and effectiveness (Robertson et al., 2009). Conversely, among existing dense re- trieval methods, none has achieved the widespread popularity of BM25. We have opted for SGPT, which has recently attained state-of-the-art perfor- mance across a variety of datasets. (Muennighoff, 2022). In our experimental analysis presented in Table 7, we found that BM25 consistently surpasses SGPT in performance across various datasets within the dynamic RAG framework, despite SGPT’s gener- ally better performance in numerous information re- trieval tasks. This outcome aligns with the findings of prior research, such as the study by (Ram et al., 2023), which underscored BM25’s effectiveness in RAG tasks. These results indicate that despite progress in dense retrieval technologies like SGPT, the simpler, lexicon-based BM25 algorithm is still a strong baseline for enhancing the performance of LLM in RAG tasks. 6 Conclusions and Future Works In this work, we propose DRAGIN, a dynamic RAG framework tailored to address the real-time information needs of LLMs during text generation. By integrating RIND for timely retrieval activation and QFS for precise query formulation, DRAGIN significantly outperforms existing dynamic RAG methods across various knowledge-intensive bench- Table 7: Comparison of performance between BM25 and SGPT using the LLaMA2-13B-Chat model.
