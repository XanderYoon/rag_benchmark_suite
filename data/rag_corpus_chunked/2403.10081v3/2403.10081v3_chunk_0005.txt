the input for the model. Previous research has explored single-round re- trieval augmentation extensively. For instance, RE- PLUG (Shi et al., 2023) treats LLMs as a black box and leverages them to generate training data for the retrieval model. From a different perspective, UniWeb (Li et al., 2023d) proposes an adaptive search engine-assisted learning method that can self-assess whether the LLM requires retrieval aug- mentation. 2.2 Multi-round Retrieval-augmented LLM Single-round retrieval can be relatively effective for simple tasks or cases where user information needs are clear-cut. However, for complex tasks or tasks involving the generation of lengthy text, such as long-form question answering, multi-hop reasoning, chain-of-thought reasoning, etc., rely- ing solely on the user’s initial input for retrieval Input:Pleasegivemea brief introduction to Einstein LLMGenerating: RIND:Real-time Information NeedDetectionContinueGenerationaposition at the Universityof𝓗𝒊𝒂𝒎𝒂𝒙(𝒊)𝒔𝒊 0.561.350.030.012.560.020.430.220.260.350.760.15010010 ×××××××××××× ...... 00.16001.950𝑺𝑹𝑰𝑵𝑫 RetrievalModule QFS:Query Formulation based on Self-attentionPlease givemea brief introduction to Einstein<SEP>Einsteinwas born in the German Empire and moved to Switzerland in 1895.
