mation from these passages. We select the following case: Question What is the name of the fight song of the uni- versity whose main campus is in Lawrence, Kansas, and whose branch campuses are in the Kansas City metropolitan area? Our framework first detects that the LLM needs to determine which university’s main campus is located in Lawrence, Kansas, and thus retrieves three passages: Retrieved Passages P1: The Kansas City metropolitan area’s largest private employer is Cerner Corpora- tion..... P2: University of Kansas The University of Kansas, also referred to as KU, is a pub- lic research university in the U.S. state of Kansas ...... P3: The population of the Kansas City MSA grew from 1,842,965 to an estimated 2,037,357..... The second of the three passages is relevant. However, the LLaMA-7B model, which performs poorly in long context scenarios, failed to generate the correct answer based on this retrieved external knowledge, despite the passage indeed addressing the LLM’s real-time information needs. Therefore, future work should explore how to enable large models to effectively understand complex informa- tion in extended contexts.
