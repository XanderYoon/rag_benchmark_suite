Formulation This subsection delves into the impact of query formulation techniques on the performance of dy- namic RAG frameworks. We standardize the tim- ing of trigger retrieval to RIND, which is proven to be the most effective timing based on the experi- mental results detailed in section 5.3. We focus on the comparison between DRAGIN and three exist- ing frameworks: FLARE, FL-RAG, and FS-RAG. The query formulation method of FLARE is the last generated sentence excludes low-probability to- kens. FL-RAG selects the closest 25 tokens to this position as the query. FS-RAG selects the sentence before this position as the query. We also evaluate the effectiveness of using the full context as the query. As shown in Table 6, DRAGIN’s query for- mulation method performs best among all the dy- namic RAG frameworks. FLARE emerged as the second most effective query formulation method, outperforming the FS-RAG and FL-RAG methods. Moreover, leveraging the entire context as a query did not yield optimal results, indicating potential redundancy within the full context. This finding validates the effectiveness of our proposed QFS method, which aims to select tokens from the con- text that can represent the real-time information needs of the LLM as the query. 5.5 Impact of Retriever In the dynamic RAG paradigm, the choice of the retriever plays an important role in retrieving rel- evant passages from a corpus based on a given query. In the field of information retrieval, the two popular types of retrieval methods are lexical matching (Zhai, 2008; Robertson et al., 2009) and dense retrieval (Su et al., 2023b; Gao and Callan, 2021; Su et al., 2023a; Muennighoff, 2022; Li et al., 2023b; Ma et al., 2023; Ye et al., 2024; Su et al., 2023c; Li et al., 2023a; Chen et al., 2023, 2022; Li et al., 2023c;
