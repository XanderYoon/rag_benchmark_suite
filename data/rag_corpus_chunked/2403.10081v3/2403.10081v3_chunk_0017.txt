The results, summarized in Table 2, underscore several critical insights: (1) The integration of single-round retrieval augmentation consistently boosts LLMs’ performance across all datasets when compared to direct question answering, confirming the effec- tiveness of RAG. (2) Despite the overall positive impact of retrieval augmentation, we observe that fixed rules-based retrieval methods, e.g. FL-RAG and FS-RAG, do not always outperform single- round retrieval. This observation validates our hy- pothesis that retrieval augmentation, if conducted at a wrong position, may not be helpful in improving the quality of LLM’s outputs. This underscores the significance of timing in the activation of retrieval processes, which should be tailored to the infor- mation needs of Large Language Models (LLMs), activating retrieval only when LLMs necessitate ex- ternal knowledge. (3) The performance of FLARE varies significantly among different datasets. In- terestingly, as shown in our ablation study (§ 5.4), the query formulation strategies are significantly better than those used by other baselines, but its overall performance is not. This indicates that the timing of retrieval augmentation in FLARE is far from perfect. (4) Our proposed DRAGIN method demonstrates superior performance across most LLMs and datasets. This indicates the robustness and effectiveness of DRAGIN in enhancing LLMs’ capabilities.
