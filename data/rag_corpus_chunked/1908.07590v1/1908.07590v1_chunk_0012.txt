Together with 336 play-sound sentences, totalling 672 sentences are used for training and evaluation. As for evaluation, we use 5-fold cross-validation and report the four model evaluation metrics: precision, recall, accuracy, and F1. Among these metrics, we care most about precision due to the goal of achieving robust retrieval results. 4.2 Results In our experiments, We notice that the overall results of SVM and XGBoost are very similar. Thus, we simply present the results ob- tained from SVM in Table 4. Note that the table includes results derived from multiple experiments using different variations of features. In doing so, we conduct an ablation experiment to identify the most significant feature. Judging from the table, all of the fea- ture combinations achieve precision higher than 50%. Since we use half-and-half positive and negative test data, our model is verified to obtain more robust results than a simple retrieval model. As for the comparison between different feature categories, the category of special words is generally the most important for correct predic- tions. Not including it drops the precision by 8%, accuracy by 7%, and F1 by 5%, while omitting the other two categories has less sig- nificant changes in the results. Out of all features of special words, the presence of action words in a sentence is the most essential, as omitting this feature causes a drop of 4%. Omitting other special word features individually only causes a mere drop of around 1% on average, so we do not display these results. It is also surprising that including the presence of now (part of time-based
