Weather words are those related to weather, such as raining, thunderstorm, wind, snow, etc. Negative words are associated with nullity, such as not, cannot, none, etc. Time-based words include past, now and future words, such as had, just, currently, since then, after, etc. Part of Speech (POS): We find that the POS features play an important role in deciding the connections between sound and text. For example, candidate triggers that function as nouns in sentences more likely to be related to the real scene when compared with those that function as adjectives. We employ a one-hot encoding to represent the part of speech which the words serve as in the sentence. In addition to candidate triggers themselves, we also use the part of speech of the words before and after the candidate triggers to provide more complete semantic information. Syntactic: We utilize the results of dependency parsing analysis on the candidate triggers to set up more features. For example, we can see that if a candidate trigger is a subject, object, or attribute to a verb, it is likely to indicate a sound. On the contrary, if it is attributed to a noun, it is likely not related to any sounds and instead plays a descriptive role in the sentence. We also employ a one-hot encoding to represent the different results of dependency parsing analysis on the candidate triggers.

Though simple, we prove that these intuitive features produce safer results than plain retrieval results. In our experiments, we em- ploy two popular machine learning approaches,
