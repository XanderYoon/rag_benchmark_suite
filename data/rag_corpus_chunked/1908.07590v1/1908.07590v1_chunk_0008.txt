category. 3 SEMANTIC INFERENCE MODEL Based on the previous discussions, retrieving sound effects using only keywords is not sufficient to guarantee the robustness of re- sults. Instead, the whole context should be considered when adding the sound effects to a story. In this section, we introduce a model with fine-designed features that can make inference about the ne- cessity of adding sound effects based on contextual information. Robust matching between texts and sounds requires not only the literal connection but also the semantic information from the con- text. To exploit such information, we design a number of features inspired by the first annotated dataset. The features we design can be categorized into three kinds: special words, part of speech and syntactic features which are elaborated as follows. Special Words: We find that some special words convey impor- tant information about whether the sound effects are happening. For example, if a sentence contains the word which implies a sub- junctive situation such as "plan", "like" and so on, the event that is associated with sound effects is often not happening. Such rule lends itself to not only subjunctive words but also action words, weather-related words, negative words, and time-based words. We use the counts of these special words or phrases in the sentences under each category as the several numerical features. To be spe- cific, action words are associated with actions that often involve sounds, such as knocking, crying, yelling, etc. Weather words are those related to weather, such as raining, thunderstorm, wind, snow, etc. Negative words are associated with nullity, such as not, cannot, none, etc. Time-based words include past, now and future words, such as had, just, currently, since then, after, etc. Part of Speech (POS): We find that the POS features play an important role in deciding the
