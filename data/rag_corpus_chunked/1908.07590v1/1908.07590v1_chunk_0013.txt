of special words, the presence of action words in a sentence is the most essential, as omitting this feature causes a drop of 4%. Omitting other special word features individually only causes a mere drop of around 1% on average, so we do not display these results. It is also surprising that including the presence of now (part of time-based category) words actually worsens the predictions in every aspect by a consid- erable amount. One potential explanation of such observation is that the signal contained by now words are hard to generalize in newly seen scenarios, causing a discrepancy in distribution. The POS category seems to have the strongest effect on recall, and the syntactic feature has overall the weakest effect on results. 5 DISCUSSION ON ADDITIONAL RULES Some features are either hard to encode or already very strong to make the inference on their own, so we use the heuristic of combining features-based classification with additional rules. For this method, we use the combined features that give the best result, which is all but the feature that tracks the presence of now words. Then, we manually add a few rules: no sound should be played if 1. the scene words are in quotations or after colons; 2. the scene words appear after phrases including but not limited to "as if", "as though", "like", indicating a simile or metaphor. Using a combination of features and rules, we expect to see more robust results. Interpreting from the results in Table 5, only precision improved by a small amount, while results in other metrics dropped.
