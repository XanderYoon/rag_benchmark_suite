However, unexpected difficulties need to be addressed first under such a practical setting. To be specific, texts are often loosely related to the sounds and contain lots of noise, and simple keywords cannot be used consistently as reliable queries to retrieve sound effects. Datasets of public sound effects with descriptive tags are com- mon such as Adobe Audition Sound Effects 1, Freesound 2 and SoundBible 3. We establish a sound-tag database with these re- sources and further enrich the tags to allow basic retrieval algo- rithm, such as BM25 [8], to match the sound effects with stories. However, the retrieved results are prone to be unreliable. Specif- ically, not all of the tags in stories, which are called candidate triggers in this paper, indicate sound effects on a semantic level. For example, in our mind, the candidate trigger "forest" is related to a scene sound effect that may contain the voice of birds and insects. But in a story, the word "forest" could potentially be combined with other words and form a phrase such as "the king of forest", which is not describing a scene at all. In addition, even if the word "forest" is describing a scene, it might not be the scene where the story is taking place. For example, the word "forest" in "Little Piggy plans to go on a picnic in the forest" is describing forest as a scene, yet the current location is not the forest. Since the piggy has not gone to the forest yet, it would be unfit to play a sound here. More examples are displayed in Table 1. Further analysis reveals that over 40% triggers suggested by the retrieved results should not be added with sound effects. Such observation indicates that accepting the results returned by retrieval-based methods indiscriminately leads to
