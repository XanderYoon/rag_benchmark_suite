The bold words are the candidate triggers returned by the retrieval model. human reading. In addition to the human voices, the radio pro- ducer would manually add the sound effects that are implied by the stories in order to enhance the atmosphere. For example, cer- tain sounds effects are expected to be played when the storyteller says "the wind is roaring" or "the Wolf Grandma knocked on the door". Though not seeing the actual scene in person, the listeners could reconstruct pseudo imagery in their minds with the help of these sounds. Such manually added sound effects have been found useful not only in helping listeners reconstruct the imagery but also in increasing their attention span [9]. However, producing one radio story with sound effects takes onerous human work. With the mature development of text-to-speech technology [11] and its successful application on storytelling [3, 6, 7], it is interesting to study the process of automatically adding sound effects to radio stories. Consequently, an end-to-end pipeline could be
