To better understand the elemental relationship between story and sound, we preliminarily annotate around 1300 radio stories, which are crawled from the web and with general public copyrights. During the process of annotation, we ask the human labelers to think about two key questions: 1. Are there any key words, i.e. candidate triggers, in the stories that might corre- spond to sounds? If so, what category of sound effects correspond to each trigger? 2. How confident do you think the sound effect does happen in the context of the story? The first question enables us to have a glimpse of the connections on the literal level, while the second one focuses on the semantic level. The human labelers are asked to span the candidate triggers and choose both the categories of the sounds and their levels of confidence ranging from 0 to 2. A larger number indicates a more reliable connection and 0 represents no semantic-level connection. We conduct a statistical analysis of the annotation data and report our results briefly as follows. There is a large number of possible places for adding sound effects in the stories: as shown in Table 2, around 6.25 key can- didate triggers are found related to sound effects per story. As for the confidence of the connections, there are on average 4.61 candidate triggers labeled with confidence larger than 0, which implies that 1.64 candidate triggers in each story do not indicate real sound effects on the semantic level. Continuing our analysis, we divide text-triggered sound effects into four categories: action- triggered sound, scene-triggered sound, character-triggered sound, and onomatopoeia-triggered sound. As expected,
