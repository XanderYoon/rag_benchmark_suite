as queries to retrieve the candidate sentences from 632 new stories. Note that the top 16 categories of the scene triggers account for around 83.88% of all scene-triggered sound effects. Focusing on these categories helps alleviate the noise caused by those long- tailed sound effects. The 16 kinds of scenes are "forest", "mountain", "river", "sea", "rain", "wind", "thunder", "park", "party", "farm", "plaza", "prairie", "restaurant", "pool", "school" and "campfire". Finally, we produce 2069 candidate sentences that may connect to real sound effects. Then we label all of the candidate sentences through crowd- sourcing. Note that the stories contained in the new dataset are completely different from those in the dataset where our inspiration came from in order to test the effectiveness of these features. This time, the human labelers are given sentences with high- lighted candidate triggers, and are asked to determine whether the event-triggering-sounds should be played. Each sentence is labeled three times independently by three different labelers, and only the consistent labels are used in the later experiments. Table 3 shows the labelers’ results. Since the dataset is relatively small, it is im- portant to guarantee the correctness of the labels for the sentences. Therefore, we used only the sentences all three labelers agreed on. For the purpose of balancing the positive and negative labels, we sample 336 sentences marked as no-play-sound arbitrarily from the 4http://sc.chinaz.com/yinxiao/ 5https://github.com/huyingxi/Synonyms Feature Excluded Precision Recall Accuracy F1 None 0.7022 0.7718 0.7195 0.7313 Special Words 0.6213 0.7758 0.6501 0.6877 Action Words 0.6614 0.8061 0.6960 0.7246 Now Words 0.7167 0.8033 0.7410 0.7547 POS 0.6986 0.6990 0.6980 0.6961 Syntactic 0.6876 0.7572 0.7046 0.7173 Table 4: Results of ablation experiment using SVM. 1251 sentences.
