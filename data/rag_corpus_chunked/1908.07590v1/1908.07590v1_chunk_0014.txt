However, for the real-life application of adding sound effects to radio stories, this method would be valuable since we care more about whether the added sounds are appropriate than whether we miss opportunities to add sounds. 6 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK The application of cross-modal retrieval models between texts and sound effects is less studied. In this paper, we focus on the task of re- trieving sound effect to radio stories. However, we find that naively using keywords-based retrieval is not good enough because of the ambiguity of story content. Therefore, we analyze the potential to utilize a semantic inference model which helps to improve the precision of the retrieval. The results on an annotated dataset using crowdsourcing attest that our model successfully decreases the false positive rate. Further ablation results reveal the importance of each feature which might be useful in improving the efficiency of fea- ture engineering. We also propose to use heuristic rules to further increase the precision which in turn undermines the recall and lead to a trade-off problem. As for future work, we suppose that it is important to study the signals contained in a larger range than one single sentence. One promising way is to apply the neural network to exploit the information on the sentence level and circumvent onerous feature engineering work if more data is available.
