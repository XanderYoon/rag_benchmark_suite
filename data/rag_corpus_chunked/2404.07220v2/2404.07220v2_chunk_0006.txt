result surpasses the efficacy of all other formulations, establishing a new benchmark for retrieval tasks within this dataset. 2) Top-10 Retrieval Accuracy on TREC-Covid dataset: For the TREC-COVID dataset [7], which encompasses relevancy scores spanning from -1 to 2, with -1 indicative of irrelevance Fig. 1: Scheme of Creating Blended Retrievers using Semantic Search with Hybrid Queries. Fig. 2: Top-10 Retriever Accuracy for NQ Dataset and 2 denoting high relevance, our initial assessments targeted documents with a relevancy of 1, deemed partially relevant. Figure 3 analysis reveals a superior performance of vector search hybrid queries over those based on keywords. In particular, hybrid queries that leverage the Sparse EncodeR utilizing Best Fields demonstrate the highest efficacy across all index types at 78% accuracy. Fig. 3: Top 10 retriever accuracy for Trec-Covid Score-1 Subsequent to the initial evaluation, the same spectrum of queries was subjected to assessment against the TREC- COVID dataset with a relevancy score of 2, denoting that the documents were entirely pertinent to the associated queries. Figure 4 illustrated with a relevance score of two, where documents fully meet the relevance criteria for associated queries, reinforce the efficacy of vector search hybrid queries Fig. 4: Top 10 retriever accuracy for Trec-Covid Score-2 Fig. 5: Top 10 retriever accuracy for HotPotQA dataset over conventional keyword-based methods. Notably, the hy- brid query incorporating Sparse Encoder with Best Fields demonstrates a 98% top-10 retrieval accuracy, eclipsing all other formulations. This suggests that a methodological pivot towards more nuanced blended search, particularly those that effectively utilize the Best Fields, can significantly enhance retrieval outcomes in information retrieval (IR) systems. 3) Top-10 Retrieval Accuracy on the HotPotQA dataset : The HotPotQA [8] dataset, with its extensive corpus of over 5M documents and a query set comprising 7,500 items, presents a formidable challenge for
