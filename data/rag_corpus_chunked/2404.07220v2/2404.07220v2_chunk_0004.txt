similarity-based retrieval to encapsulate the nuanced relationships between terms, thereby capturing a more authentic representation of user intent and document relevance. A. Methodology Our methodology unfolds in a sequence of progressive steps, commencing with the elementary match query within the BM25 index. We then escalate to hybrid queries that amalgamate diverse search techniques across multiple fields, leveraging the multi-match query within the Sparse Encoder- Based Index. This method proves invaluable when the exact location of the query text within the document corpus is in- determinate, hence ensuring a comprehensive match retrieval. The multi-match queries are categorized as follows: • Cross Fields: Targets concurrence across multiple fields • Most Fields: Seeks text representation through different lenses across various fields. • Best Fields: Pursues the aggregation of words within a singular field. • Phrase Prefix: Operates similarly to Best Fields but prioritizes phrases over keywords. After initial match queries, we incorporate dense vector (KNN) and sparse encoder indices, each with their bespoke hybrid queries. This strategic approach synthesizes the strengths of each index, channeling them towards the unified goal of refin- ing retrieval accuracy within our RAG system. We calculate the top-k retrieval accuracy metric to distill the essence of each query type. In Figure 1, we introduce a scheme designed to create Blended Retrievers by blending semantic search with hybrid queries. B. Constructing RAG System From the plethora of possible permutations, a select sextet (top 6) of hybrid queries—those exhibiting paramount retrieval efficacy—were chosen for further scrutiny. These queries were then subjected to rigorous evaluation across the benchmark datasets to ascertain the precision of the retrieval component within RAG. The sextet queries represent the culmination of retriever experimentation, embodying the synthesis of our finest query strategies aligned with various index types. The six blended queries are then fed to generative question-
