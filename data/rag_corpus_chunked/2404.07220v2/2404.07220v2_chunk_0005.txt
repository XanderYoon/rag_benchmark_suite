retrieval efficacy—were chosen for further scrutiny. These queries were then subjected to rigorous evaluation across the benchmark datasets to ascertain the precision of the retrieval component within RAG. The sextet queries represent the culmination of retriever experimentation, embodying the synthesis of our finest query strategies aligned with various index types. The six blended queries are then fed to generative question- answering systems. This process finds the best retrievers to feed to the Generator of RAG, given the exponential growth in the number of potential query combinations stemming from the integration with distinct index types. The intricacies of constructing an effective RAG system are multi-fold, particularly when source datasets have diverse and complex landscapes. We undertook a comprehensive evalua- tion of a myriad of hybrid query formulations, scrutinizing their performance across benchmark datasets, including the Natural Questions (NQ), TREC-COVID, Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SqUAD), and HotPotQA. IV. E XPERIMENTATION FOR RETRIEVER EVALUATION We used top-10 retrieval accuracy to narrow down the six best types of blended retrievers (index + hybrid query) for comparison for each benchmark dataset. 1) Top-10 retrieval accuracy on the NQ dataset : For the NQ dataset [6], our empirical analysis has demonstrated the superior performance of hybrid query strategies, attributable to the ability to utilize multiple data fields effectively. In Figure 2, our findings reveal that the hybrid query approach employing the Sparse Encoder with Best Fields attains the highest retrieval accuracy, reaching an impressive 88.77%. This result surpasses the efficacy of all other formulations, establishing a new benchmark for retrieval tasks within this dataset. 2) Top-10 Retrieval Accuracy on TREC-Covid dataset: For the TREC-COVID dataset [7], which encompasses relevancy scores spanning from -1 to 2, with -1 indicative of irrelevance Fig. 1: Scheme of Creating Blended Retrievers using Semantic Search with Hybrid Queries.
