C ONCLUSION Blended RAG pipeline is highly effective across multiple datasets despite not being specifically trained on them. No- tably, this approach does not necessitate exemplars for prompt engineering which are often required in few-shot learning, indicating a robust generalization capability within the zero- shot paradigm. This study demonstrated: • Optimization of R with Blended Search: Incorporating Semantic Search, specifically Sparse Encoder indices coupled with ’Best Fields’ queries, has emerged as the superior construct across all, setting a new benchmark of 87% for Retriever Accuracy on TREC-COVID. • Enhancement of RAG via Blended Retrievers: The sig- nificant amplification in retrieval accuracy is particu- larly pronounced for the overall evaluation of the RAG pipeline, surpassing prior benchmarks on fine-tuned sets by a wide margin. Blended RAG sets a new benchmark at 68% F1 Score on SQUAD and 42% EM Score on NQ dataset; for non-tuned Q&A systems. The empirical findings endorse the potency of Blended Re- trievers in refining RAG systems beyond focusing on LLM size & type, getting better results with relatively smaller LLM and thus setting a foundation for more intelligent and contextually aware Generative Q&A systems.
