tweaking LLM prompts, tuning etc.,[9] they have limited impact on the overall accuracy of the RAG system, since if R part is feeding irreverent context then answer would be inaccurate. Furthermore, most retrieval methodologies employed in RAG pipelines rely on keyword and similarity-based searches, which can restrict the system's overall accuracy. Finding the best search method for RAG is still an emerging area of research. The goal of this study is to enhance retriever and RAG accuracy by incorporating Semantic Search-Based Retrievers and Hybrid Search Queries. III. B LENDED RETRIEVERS For RAG systems, we explored three distinct search strate- gies: keyword-based similarity search, dense vector-based, and semantic-based sparse encoders, integrating these to formu- late hybrid queries. Unlike conventional keyword matching, semantic search delves into the nuances of a user’s query, deci- phering context and intent. This study systematically evaluates an array of search techniques across three primary indices: BM25 [4] for keyword-based, KNN [5] for vector-based, and Elastic Learned Sparse Encoder (ELSER) for sparse encoder- based semantic search. 1) BM25 Index: The BM25 index is adept at employing full-text search capabilities enhanced by fuzzy matching techniques, laying the groundwork for more sophisti- cated query operations. 2) Dense Vector Index: We construct a dense vector index empowered by sentence transformers. It identifies the proximity of vector representations derived from docu- ment and query content. 3) Sparse Encoder Index: The Sparse EncodeR Retriever Model index is an amalgam of semantic understanding and similarity-based retrieval to encapsulate the nuanced relationships between terms, thereby capturing a more authentic representation of user intent and document relevance. A. Methodology Our methodology unfolds in a sequence of progressive steps, commencing with the elementary match query within the BM25 index. We then escalate to hybrid queries that amalgamate diverse search techniques across multiple fields, leveraging the multi-match query
