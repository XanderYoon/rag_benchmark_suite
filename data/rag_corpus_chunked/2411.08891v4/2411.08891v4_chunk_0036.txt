paper provides all necessary training and test details, including data splits, optimizer, hyperparameters, and model settings, primarily in Sec. B. Guidelines: • The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. • The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. • The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material. 7.Experiment statistical significance Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropri- ate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The paper reports error bars (standard deviation across random seeds) in most main tables and figures, and explains how they were computed in Sec. D.8. Guidelines: 17 • The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. • The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi- dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. • The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). • The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.) • The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors). • It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean. • It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should prefer- ably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the
