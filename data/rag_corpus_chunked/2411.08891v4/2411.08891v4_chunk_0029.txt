Answer: [Yes] Justification: The main claim, CalibRAG ensures that decisions informed by RAG are well calibrated, is clearly stated in both the abstract and introduction. It is also consistently supported by the method’s design and empirical results. Guidelines: • The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. • The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be
