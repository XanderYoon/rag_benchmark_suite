Given a taskxon which a user must make a decision, we assume an associated open-ended queryq. The retriever then selects a relevant documentdfrom an external database. Conditioned onqandd, the LLMMproduces a long-form guidancezto support the decision. In addition to this guidance, we must also provide a confidence scorec. This score can be obtained in two ways: (i) by askingMto verbalize its own confidence, or (ii) by predicting it using a sep- arately
