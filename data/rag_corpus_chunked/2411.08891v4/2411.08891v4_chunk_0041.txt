The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. • The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. • The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. • For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. • If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets,paperswithcode.com/ datasetshas curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. • For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided. • If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset’s creators. 13.New assets Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documenta- tion provided alongside the assets? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The paper introduces both a new synthetic supervision dataset and a trained CalibRAG model designed to forecast decision correctness with temperature-aware con- ditioning. Their construction and usage are well documented in Sec. 3.2, Sec. 3.3, and Sec. B. Guidelines: • The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets. • Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc. • The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used. • At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file. 14.Crowdsourcing and research with human subjects
