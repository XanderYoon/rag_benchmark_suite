the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? 15 Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not present formal theoretical results, such as theorems or proofs. While it includes mathematical formulations(1, 2, 3, 4) to define the calibration objective and forecasting function, these are used to describe the method rather than to prove theoretical guarantees. Guidelines: • The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. • All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross- referenced. • All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theo- rems. • The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. • Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be comple- mented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. • Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced. 4.Experimental result reproducibility Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclu- sions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The paper provides detailed descriptions of the training (Sec. 3.2) and in- ference pipelines (Sec. 3.4), includes mathematical formulations for key components (e.g. forecasting functionf(t, q, d)), and outlines dataset construction procedures (Sec. 3.3). It also describes experimental settings, and uses widely available models and datasets (Sec. 4, Sec. B). Guidelines: • The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. • If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to
