your certainty level, no other words or explanation. Certainty Levels: Unlikely, Doubtful, Uncertain, Ambiguous, Probable, Likely, Possible, Specified, Confirmed, Certain, Inevitable. For example: Certainty: <ONLY the certainty level that Answer is correct, without any extra commentary whatsoever; just the certainty level!> Certainty: (b) This prompt requires the model to evaluate the certainty of an answer using a predefined set of linguistic levels of certainty. We used this prompt for our baselines that utilize linguistic calibration. Number calibration prompt Provide the certainty level of answer using the given 11 certainty levels. Give ONLY your certainty level, no other words or explanation. Certainty Levels: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. For example: Certainty: <ONLY the certainty level that Answer is correct, without any extra commentary whatsoever; just the number!> Certainty: (c) This prompt is similar to the linguistic calibration prompt but uses numerical certainty levels (from 0 to 10) to rate the confidence in the answer provided. We used this prompt for our baselines that utilize number calibration. Figure 16: Prompt used for baseline experiments. 36
