D Additional experiments D.1 Analysis ofϵ In our experiments,ϵwas set as a balanced choice to manage the trade-off between accuracy and cal- ibration error. As shown in Table 4, increasingϵresults in retrieving a larger number of new queries, incorporating more relevant information, and thereby improving accuracy. However, this increase can potentially lead to higher calibration errors. Specifically, while better retrieval enhanced predic- tion accuracy, the confidence scores for these predictions only increased marginally. This mismatch between improved accuracy and relatively low confidence resulted in underconfident predictions, which contributed to a slight increase in calibration error.
