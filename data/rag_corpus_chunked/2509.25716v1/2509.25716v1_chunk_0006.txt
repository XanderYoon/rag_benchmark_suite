samples (83%) as having clear intent, which we use for our primary evaluation. The remaining 145 samples with ambiguous intent are excluded from our main results but analyzed separately to understand failure cases. 4.2. Index Construction Our search index covers 277 distinct Script Include namespaces containing 3,337 individual APIs. The index documents vary significantly in length: full scripts range from 66 to 10,407 tokens (mean: 2,280), while corresponding JSDoc summaries are more concise, ranging from 157 to 5,368 tokens (mean: 807). Through extensive experimentation, we found that JSDoc summaries provide superior retrieval per- formance compared to raw code. This is attributed to their structured nature and focused representation of API functionality. Consequently, we use JSDoc summaries for our final optimized index, which provides a cleaner signal for retrieval while maintaining comprehensive coverage of API capabilities. 4.3. Knowledge Graph Construction We constructed a hierarchical Knowledge Graph from ServiceNow platform metadata to enable efficient search space pruning. The graph captures the relationship between packages, scopes, and Script Includes, allowing us to filter candidates based on contextual relevance before expensive retrieval operations. Appendix B details how this metadata-based graph helps reduce search space in our use case. 5. Experimental Setup 5.1. Evaluation Metrics We evaluate our retrieval pipeline using two primary metrics: • Top-K Accuracy:The percentage of queries where the correct Script Include appears in the top-K retrieved results. We report results for K = @5, @10, @20, and @40. • Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR):The average of the reciprocal ranks of the correct Script Include across all queries, providing a more nuanced view of ranking quality. 5.2. Baselines and Implementation We compare our proposed pipeline against BM25 [2] as the primary baseline, which achieved 53.02% top-40 accuracy on our dataset. Our implementation uses the following components: • Embedding Model:Linq-AI-Research/Linq-Embed-Mistral (7B parameters, 32K context
