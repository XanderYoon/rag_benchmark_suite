A.1. Knowledge Graph Filtering Our Knowledge Graph, constructed from ServiceNow platform metadata, captures hierarchical rela- tionships across 17,701 Script Includes. Analysis reveals that 84% of new SI usages conform to existing patterns, enabling effective search space reduction. By prioritizing globally scoped Script Includes, we reduce candidate sets by approximately 59% before expensive retrieval operations. A.2. Indexing Strategy Impact Table 5 quantifies the impact of our enhanced indexing strategy. Grouping methods under parent namespaces and enriching with JSDoc documentation provides dramatic improvements across all metrics.

Reranking Analysis Table 6 shows that the LLM reranker (Gemini 2.5 Flash) provides substantial improvements over cross- encoder approaches, achieving 72.60% top-5 accuracy compared to 65.84% for the Qwen Reranker (8B).

Code Trimming and Context Length We analyzed the impact of code trimming and context length on retrieval performance. To avoid bloating the embedding model with excessive or noisy context, we experimented with various lengths of prefix code. Our experiments show that a context of 8-10 lines before the cursor yields the best performance, gaining a 1.82% relative increase over using a larger context in our Prefix Code Embed (Non-FIM) Search. This optimal context length balances the need for sufficient information to infer developer intent while avoiding noise from distant code that may not be relevant to the current retrieval task. Note that the downstream code generation task may require more context. Figure 4 illustrates the relationship between context length and retrieval accuracy. A.5. Code Before vs. After Analysis We investigated whether using code that comes
