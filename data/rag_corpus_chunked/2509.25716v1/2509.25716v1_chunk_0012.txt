Conclusion We present DeepCodeSeek, a comprehensive solution for real-time API retrieval in enterprise code completion scenarios. Our multi-stage retrieval pipeline achieves 87.86% top-40 accuracy, more than doubling BM25 baseline performance while addressing the critical challenge of inferring developer intent from partial code. Our key contributions are: (1) a novel retrieval pipeline combining knowledge graph filtering, enriched indexing with JSDoc documentation, and advanced query enhancement techniques; (2) a comprehensive post-training pipeline optimizing compact reranker models through synthetic dataset generation, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning; and (3) demonstration that our optimized 0.6B reranker now outperforms the 8B model (68.58% vs 66.10% top-5 accuracy) while maintaining 2.5x reduced latency. Ablation studies show significant component contributions: knowledge graph filtering reduces search space by 59%, enhanced indexing improves accuracy by 31 percentage points, and LLM reranking provides an additional 7 percentage point boost, enabling real-time code completion in production environments. 8.1. Limitations and Future Work Our evaluation has limitations: dataset focus on Script Includes limits generalization to other code completion contexts, synthetic data generation may not capture real-world complexity, and small synthetic dataset size (204 samples) constrains training experiments. Future work will focus on expanding data coverage through larger synthetic dataset generation and real-world data collection, refining the knowledge graph for enhanced filtering, and specializing the reranker for specific code completion tasks.
