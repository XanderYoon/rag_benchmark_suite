Code Embed (Non-FIM) and Hypothetical Code Generation ) use the actual code for retrieval. This provides the search model with more specific information, which likely explains why they perform better in some situations. I. Qualitative Examples of Retrieval Techniques To illustrate the differences between our retrieval methods, this section provides a concrete example of how each technique processes the same partial code snippet. I.1. Shared Context: User’s Partial Code The following JavaScript code snippet is used as the input for all three retrieval techniques discussed below. The developer’s intent is to find common elements between two arrays, a task for which the ArrayUtilScript Include is the correct tool. va r prevGrp = [ ] ; va r c u r r e n t G r p = [ ] ; va r commonGrp = [ ] ; va r manager ; va r backupmgr ; c u r r e n t G r p . push ( e v e n t . parm1 ) ; va r c u r r e n t G r p L i s t = c u r r e n t G r p . t o S t r i n g ( ) . s p l i t ( " , " ) ; va r grp =newG l i d e R e c o r d ( ’ s y s _ u s e r _ g r o u p ’ ) ; grp . addQuery ( ’ s y s _ i d ’ , e v e n t . parm2 ) ; grp . query ( ) ; i f( grp . n e x t ( ) ) { manager = grp . manager ; backupmgr = grp
