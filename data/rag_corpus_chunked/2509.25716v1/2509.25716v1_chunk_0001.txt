Script Includes in ServiceNow are reusable JavaScript components that serve as a centralized repository for storing functions and classes, enabling developers to encapsulate complex business logic [1]. This paper addresses the critical challenge of context retrieval for LLM-powered code generation in ServiceNow’s code completion and Build Agent tasks. The core problem is accurately retrieving relevant Script Includes from partial developer code without explicit queries. Traditional methods like keyword search or basic vector search fail to capture nuanced developer intent and lack awareness of complex hierarchical relationships across the ServiceNow platform. General-purpose LLMs also lack domain-specific knowledge, making high-quality retrieval essential for reusing instance-specific Script Includes. We propose DeepCodeSeek, a multi-stage retrieval pipeline that maximizes context relevance for LLMs. Our main contributions are: (1) a search pipeline using platform metadata and advanced IR techniques to significantly improve retrieval accuracy over baselines; (2) a comprehensive post-training pipeline optimizing compact reranker models through synthetic dataset generation, supervised fine- tuning, and reinforcement learning; and (3) empirical validation showing our optimized 0.6B reranker surpasses 8B models while maintaining significantly reduced latency for real-time applications.
