This process comprises four steps: (1) Document Parsing, (2) MDoc2Query, (3) Graph Assembly, and (4) Vector & Graph Storage. (1) Document Parsing.We adopt an existing multimodal PDF parsing tool, such as MinerU [40], to extract structured information from the document. Given a PDF document 𝐷={𝑃 1, 𝑃2, . . . , 𝑃𝑋 } of 𝑋 pages, we extract a layout-preserving sequence of heterogeneous document components, including: (i) paragraphs (text only); (ii) fig- ures (images with captions); (iii) tables (table images accompanied by textual captions and OCR-converted Markdown text); and (iv) equations (parsed into Markdown text). The extracted content is stored in a JSON format ordered by visual layout position. Based on this structured output, we define a set of modality-specific chunks: C={𝑐 1, 𝑐2, . . . , 𝑐𝑁 }, 𝑐 𝑖 ∈ {text,image}.(1) Paragraph text is segmented into overlapping spans using a sliding window with a maximum token length and a fixed stride. Equa- tions are treated as part of the regular text content. In contrast, each figure or table is treated as an image-modality chunk, while preserving its associated caption and any structured OCR-derived textual content. Visual noise filtering can be further applied to remove uninformative images (e.g., blank pages, string-only im- ages, or logos; see Appendix B) via visual chunk classification using zero-shot CLIP inference. (2) MDoc2Query.To bridge document content with potential information needs, we extend the Doc2Query paradigm to mul- timodal settings. For each chunk 𝑐𝑖 ∈ C , we employ a Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to generate a set of answerable query–answer pairs: Q𝑖 = n (𝑞 (1) 𝑖 , 𝑎(1) 𝑖 ), . . . ,(𝑞 (𝑀𝑖 ) 𝑖 , 𝑎(𝑀𝑖 ) 𝑖 ) o , 𝑀 𝑖 ≤𝑀 max.(2) Conference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY Yongyue Zhang and Yaxiong Wu Figure
