graph-based evidence aggregation, which together improve grounding, coverage, and factual consistency when answering com- plex questions over multimodal long-context documents. 3.5 MDoc2Query Optimization The effectiveness of MLDocRAG largely depends on the quality of the Multimodal Chunk–Query Graph (MCQG), which is con- structed via MDoc2Query. In particular, the quality and granularity of the generatedanswerable queriesproduced by MDoc2Query are critical, as they directly determine the semantic coverage, retriev- ability, and grounding fidelity of the overall pipeline. To this end, we explore optimization strategies for MDoc2Query from both non-parametricandparametricperspectives. Non-Parametric Optimization.By default, MDoc2Query in ML- DocRAG employs a LVLM to generate a set of answerable queries from parsed document chunks, such as cropped images or parsed ta- ble segments. However, document parsing tools (e.g., MinerU [40]) often strip away essential contextual information—including figure captions, table headers, and hierarchical section titles—resulting in isolated chunks that can be semantically ambiguous and con- sequently degrade the quality of the generated queries. To miti- gate this issue, we adopt aPage-Context-A ware Generationstrategy. Specifically, for a given chunk 𝑐𝑖 located on page 𝑥 with the cor- responding page rendering image 𝑃 page 𝑥 , we construct the LVLM input as a tuple (𝑐𝑖, 𝑃page 𝑥 ). Incorporating page-level visual context enables the model to resolve ambiguities arising from incomplete local information, such as coreference resolution (e.g., linking a chunk labeled “Table 3” to its corresponding description on the same page). Parametric Optimization.In addition to non-parametric strate- gies, we further explore parametric optimization by fine-tuning a pretrained Large Vision–Language Model (LVLM) on a curated set of high-quality multimodalchunk-to-queryexemplars. Each train- ing instance consists of a multimodal chunk 𝑐 (including text, an image with its caption, or a table with structured content) paired with a set of human-curated or automatically synthesized answer- able query–answer (𝑞, 𝑎) pairs. The LVLM is
