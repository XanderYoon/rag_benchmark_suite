perspectives? 4.1 Datasets & Metrics Datasets.We evaluate our MLDocRAG on two multimodal long- context document QA benchmarks: (1)MMLongBench-Doc[ 25]: A curated benchmark for multimodal long-document understand- ing, consisting of documents in PDF format with diverse content including text, images, tables, and charts. Questions are paired with answerable evidence spread across pages and modalities. (2) Conference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY Yongyue Zhang and Yaxiong Wu LongDocURL[ 8]: A newly collected dataset containing web-based scientific and technical documents. Each instance includes a docu- ment (in PDF or HTML format), a natural language question, and annotated answerable segments across multimodal content. Metrics.We adopt exact match Accuracy as the primary evalua- tion metric to measure the factual correctness of generated answers. To ensure consistent and scalable judgment across modalities and formats, we follow recent work and employ anLLM-as-a-Judge protocol [16], using a strong LLM (e.g., Qwen2.5-72B [36, 45]) to verify whether the predicted answer matches the gold reference answer. The evaluation prompt is shown in Appendix A. 4.2 Baselines We compare MLDocRAG with representative baselines from five categories: •Text Only (txt).Use only text chunks with or without basic retrieval (BM25 [30] / BGE-m3 [5]): LC𝑡𝑥𝑡 with textual long-context reasoning, RAG𝑡𝑥𝑡 BM25 with sparse retrieval, RAG𝑡𝑥𝑡 BGE-m3 with dense retrieval. •Image2Text (txt+i2t).Augment text with LVLM-generated image captions, treated as plain text: LC𝑡𝑥𝑡+𝑖2𝑡 , RAG𝑡𝑥𝑡+𝑖2𝑡 BM25 , RAG𝑡𝑥𝑡+𝑖2𝑡 BGE-m3. •Multimodal (txt+img).Encode both text and image chunks using multimodal embedding models for dense retrieval: LC𝑡𝑥𝑡+𝑖𝑚𝑔 for multimodal long-context reasoning, MRAG𝑡𝑥𝑡+𝑖𝑚𝑔 CLIP with CLIP [29], MRAG𝑡𝑥𝑡+𝑖𝑚𝑔 SigLIP with SigLIP [37, 47], MRAG𝑡𝑥𝑡+𝑖𝑚𝑔 ColPali with ColPali [14]. •Page-level (page).Render full document pages as images and perform vision-only retrieval followed by VQA: LC𝑝𝑎𝑔𝑒 for visual long-context reasoning, VRAG𝑝𝑎𝑔𝑒 CLIP, VRAG𝑝𝑎𝑔𝑒 SigLIP, VRAG𝑝𝑎𝑔𝑒 ColPali. •Graph.Construct knowledge graphs from extracted multimodal entities with the augmented text (i.e.,txt+i2t) for graph-based
