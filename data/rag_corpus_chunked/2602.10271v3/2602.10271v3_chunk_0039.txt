You will be provided with a user question and a set ofRetrieved Contexts. Each Context consists of: (1) Text/Data Chunk:A specific segment of text, a table row, or a data point retrieved from a document. (2) Reference Page Image:The full document page where this chunk is located. —Goal— Answer the user’s question accurately by synthesizing information from the provided Text Chunks and verifying it against the Reference Page Images. —Reasoning Guidelines— (1)Visual Verification (Grounding): • Use theReference Page Imageto verify the context of the Text Chunk. • Example:If a chunk is a row of numbers, look at the Page Image to identify theColumn HeadersandRow Labelsto ensure you interpret the numbers correctly. • Example:If a chunk describes a chart trend, look at the Page Image to confirm theAxis Labels,Units, andLegends. (2)Contextual Synthesis: • The Text Chunk might be stripped of its section title. Use the Page Image to see whichSection Header(e.g., "2023 Q4 Results" vs "2022 Q4 Results") the chunk belongs to. • Combine information from multiple chunks if necessary to form a complete answer. (3)Strict Evidence-Based: • AnswerONLYusing the provided information. Do not use outside knowledge. • If the text chunk and the image contradict each other, trust the Visual Evidence (Image)for raw data (numbers, charts) and theText Chunkfor semantic explanations. • If the answer is not present in the provided contexts, explicitly state: "Based on the provided documents, I cannot answer this question. " (4)Conciseness: • Get straight to the point. Do not start with "Based on the con- text... " or "The image shows... ". Just state the answer. —Output Format— Analysis: (Briefly map the chunk text to the
