relevant mul- timodal content in response to a user query by leveraging the struc- ture of the Multimodal Chunk-Query Graph (MCQG). Rather than retrieving from raw document chunks, our MLDocRAG approach retrieves and aggregates content via generated queries that serve as semantically aligned retrieval anchors. This process involves four main steps: (1) Query Node Retrieval, (2) Chunk Node Ranking, (3) Context Collection, and (4) Answer Generation. (1) Query Node Retrieval.Given a user query 𝑞𝑢, we first compute its vector embedding 𝜙(𝑞 𝑢 ) using the same query encoder used dur- ing MCQG construction. We perform approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search over the query–answer vectors in the vector database to retrieve the top-𝑛semantically similar generated queries: Qret =Top 𝑛 {𝑞∈ Q | sim(𝑞𝑢, 𝑞) ≥𝛼 } .(6) MLDocRAG: Multimodal Long-Context Document Retrieval Augmented Generation Conference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY In practice, the number of retrieved queries is jointly constrained by the maximum node budget 𝑛 and a similarity threshold 𝛼∈ [ 0, 2] (e.g., 𝛼= 1.0), such that only queries with sim(𝑞𝑢, 𝑞) ≥𝛼 are retained. To capture broader contextual evidence, we expand each retrieved query node 𝑞∈ Q ret in the MCQG via multi-hop neighbor expansion. For each query𝑞∈ Q ret, we traverseℎ hops in the graph (through Query–Query Edges) and collect its neighboring queries: Qexp =Q ret ∪ Ø 𝑞∈ Qret Nbrℎ (𝑞),(7) where Nbrℎ (𝑞) denotes the set ofℎ-hop neighbors of𝑞 in the MCQG, and Qexp represents the expanded query set that augments the ini- tially retrieved queries with semantically related queries discovered through multi-hop graph traversal. (2) Chunk Node Ranking.Each query 𝑞∈ Q exp is linked to a source multimodal chunk 𝑐∈ C . We collect all chunks associated with the expanded query set: Ccand =  𝑐𝑖 | ∃𝑞∈ Q exp s.t.(𝑞, 𝑐
