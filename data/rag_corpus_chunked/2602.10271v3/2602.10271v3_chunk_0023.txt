However, performance degrades when ℎ= 3, in- dicating that excessive expansion introduces semantic noise that outweighs the gains from additional context.(2) KNN Neighbors (𝑘).Accuracy generally improves as the number of nearest neigh- bors increases, peaking around𝑘= 3. This suggests that a moderate graph density effectively bridges semantic gaps between queries, while denser connections beyond this point yield diminishing re- turns or introduce noise.(3) Max Nodes ( 𝑛).Performance exhibits a clear optimum at 𝑛= 10. Retrieving too few nodes (𝑛= 5) limits evidence coverage, whereas retrieving too many nodes ( 𝑛> 10) introduces irrelevant information, leading to notable performance drops. In addition, a stricter similarity threshold (𝛼= 1.2) consis- tently outperforms a looser threshold (𝛼= 1.0), emphasizing the importance of prioritizing high-quality entry nodes over quantity. 5.4 Impact of MDoc2Query Optimization (RQ4) Figure 6 illustrates the impact of non-parametric and parametric optimization strategies for MDoc2Query on the performance of MLDocRAG.(1) Non-Parametric Optimization.Providing each chunk with its corresponding page image during query generation consistently improves performance. Specifically,MLDocRAG 𝑃 out- performs the chunk-only MLDocRAG across both datasets, demon- strating that incorporating page-level context enhances query qual- ity by mitigating semantic fragmentation caused by isolated chunks. Representative query–answer examples generated by MDoc2Query with and without page context are provided in Appendix C. Further- more,MLDocRAG 𝑃 𝑃 integrates page-level information at both the query generation and answer generation stages, achieving the best overall performance. This result confirms that supplying reference page context throughout both retrieval indexing and QA stages maximizes evidence utilization.(2) Parametric Optimization. MLDocRAG remains effective when deployed with smaller LVLMs. Although the 32B model achieves
