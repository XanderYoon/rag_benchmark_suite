superior grounding and robustness for multimodal long-context document question answering. 5.2 Impact of Node Variants (RQ2) Figure 3 analyzes the impact of different MCQG node variants on the performance of MLDocRAG.(1) Query Node Choices (Query vs. Answer).Generated queries play a dominant role in performance. WhileMLDocRAG w/ Queryremains relatively stable,MLDocRAG w/ Answerexhibits substantial performance degradation (dropping below 39% on MMLongBench-Doc), indicating that answers alone are insufficient as graph node representations. The default ML- DocRAG, which combines queries with answers, achieves the best results by leveraging answers as complementary contextual sig- nals.(2) Chunk Node Ranking Strategies (Max vs. Mean).The Max strategy consistently outperforms Mean aggregation. Using averaged similarity scores (MLDocRAG w/ Mean) degrades perfor- mance compared to the default Max-based ranking, suggesting that a chunk’s relevance is better captured by its most relevant query (a) Hopsℎ (b) KNN𝑘 (c) Max Nodes𝑛 Figure 4: Ablation on hyperparameters (MMLongBench-Doc).

Removing this component (MLDocRAG w/o Filter) leads to noticeable performance drops, confirming that filtering out ir- relevant image chunks (e.g., blank pages or logos) is necessary to prevent noise from interfering with retrieval. 5.3 Impact of Hyperparameters (RQ3) Figures 4 and 5 illustrate the impact of key hyperparameters on the performance of MLDocRAG.(1) Expansion Hops ( ℎ).Multi-hop expansion (ℎ= 1, 2) consistently outperforms zero-hop retrieval (ℎ= 0), highlighting the benefit of query node expansion through Conference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY Yongyue Zhang and Yaxiong Wu (a) MMLongBench-Doc (b) LongDocURL Figure 6: Ablation on MDoc2Query optimization. graph traversal. However, performance degrades when ℎ= 3, in- dicating that excessive expansion introduces semantic noise that outweighs the gains from additional context.(2) KNN
