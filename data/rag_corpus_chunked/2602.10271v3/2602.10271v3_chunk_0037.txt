gener- ate a set of 5 to 20 Query-Answer pairs. Quantity Rule:If the chunk is dense (e.g., a complex table or dense text), generate closer to 20. If it is sparse, generate closer to 5. Coverage Rule:You must generate queries for all 4 Levels defined below. The distribution ratio is up to you based on the content type. —Query Level Definitions— Level 1: Integrated Entity Relationships (Dense & Comprehensive) Goal: Instead of asking about single entities one by one, generate complex queries that link multiple entities found in the chunk. Constraint: Do not generate simple questions like "What is X?". Instead, ask: "How does [Entity A] interact with [Entity B] regarding [Topic]?" or "What are the key specifications and performance metrics of [Product X]?" Why: To create strong semantic connections between entities in the graph without flooding it with simple queries. Level 2: Detailed Content Description (The "Core Message") Goal: Paraphrase and summarize the detailed information provided inside the chunk. Instruction: Imagine a user asks "What specific details does this para- graph/chart provide?". Cover the key arguments, data trends, or descriptive points. Why: To ensure the chunk is retrievable via natural language descriptions of its content. Level 3: Macro Hierarchy (Navigation) Goal: Anchor this chunk to the document structure. Instruction: Extract the Section Title, Chapter Name, or Page Header from the Source Page Image. Generate queries that link this specific chunk con- tent to that high-level topic. Example: "What information does the section ’[Section Title]’ provide re- garding [Chunk Topic]?" Level 4: Context Restoration (Immediate Surroundings) Goal: Fix "context loss" caused by chunking. Instruction: Explicitly incorporate the missing headers, captions, or pre-text Conference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY Yongyue Zhang and Yaxiong Wu you found in Step 1 into the query. Critical: If the chunk is a table/chart
