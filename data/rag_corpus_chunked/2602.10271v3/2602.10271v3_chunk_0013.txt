Qexp represents the expanded query set that augments the ini- tially retrieved queries with semantically related queries discovered through multi-hop graph traversal. (2) Chunk Node Ranking.Each query 𝑞∈ Q exp is linked to a source multimodal chunk 𝑐∈ C . We collect all chunks associated with the expanded query set: Ccand =  𝑐𝑖 | ∃𝑞∈ Q exp s.t.(𝑞, 𝑐 𝑖 ) ∈ E .(8) To prioritize the most relevant evidence, we assign a relevance score to each candidate chunk 𝑐𝑖 ∈ Ccand based on the maximum semantic similarity between the user query𝑞𝑢 and any query linked to𝑐 𝑖: score(𝑐𝑖 )=max 𝑞∈ Qexp (𝑞,𝑐𝑖 ) ∈ E sim 𝑞𝑢, 𝑞.(9) Here, {𝑞| (𝑞, 𝑐 𝑖 ) ∈ E} denotes the subset of expanded queries in Qexp that are connected to chunk𝑐 𝑖 in the MCQG. (3) Context Collection.Based on the relevance scores, we select the top-𝐾(e.g.,𝐾=5) ranked multimodal chunks: Crel =Top 𝐾 {𝑐𝑖 ∈ Ccand} ,(10) where the ranking is determined by score(𝑐𝑖 ). The selected chunks are concatenated to form the multimodal retrieval context for the LVLM. These chunks may include text blocks, image regions with captions, and tables augmented with structured and OCR-derived textual content. (4) Answer Generation.Finally, the selected multimodal context Crel is provided to a Large Vision–Language Model (LVLM), to- gether with the original user query𝑞𝑢, to generate the final answer: ˆ𝑎=LVLM (𝑞𝑢,C rel) .(11) This generation step benefits from the query-centric retrieval strat- egy and graph-based evidence aggregation, which together improve grounding, coverage, and factual consistency when answering com- plex questions over multimodal long-context documents. 3.5 MDoc2Query Optimization The effectiveness of MLDocRAG largely depends on the quality of the Multimodal Chunk–Query Graph (MCQG), which is con- structed via MDoc2Query. In particular, the quality and granularity of the generatedanswerable queriesproduced by MDoc2Query are critical, as they
