• If the answer is not present in the provided contexts, explicitly state: "Based on the provided documents, I cannot answer this question. " (4)Conciseness: • Get straight to the point. Do not start with "Based on the con- text... " or "The image shows... ". Just state the answer. —Output Format— Analysis: (Briefly map the chunk text to the visual location in the page image to confirm headers/legends) Final Answer:[Your direct answer] A.5 Evaluation Prompt Evaluation Prompt You are a strict and precise evaluation assistant. You will be given a ques- tion, a reference answer, and a candidate answer generated via retrieval- augmented generation (RAG). —Goal— Evaluate the candidate answer against the reference answer based on factual accuracy and completeness. Slight differences in phrasing are acceptable as long as the meaning is the same. If the candidate answer includes an analysis followed by "Final Answer:", only evaluate the content after "Final Answer:". If "Final Answer:" is missing, treat the entire candidate as the final answer. —Normalization for Unanswerable/None— Treat the following expressions asequivalent to "Not answerable / No answer / None"when they appear as the candidate’s final answer: • Explicit statements:"I don’t know", "Not answerable", "Not enough information", "Insufficient information", "Not mentioned", "Un- known", "Cannot be determined", "No information provided", "N/A", "Not applicable", "None". • Negative-existence statements:Assertions of absence for list/type questions, e.g., "No stages require a cooler. ", "No such category exists. ", "There are none. ", "No [items] are present. ", "None of the stages... ". Note:This normalization appliesonly when the reference answer itself is unanswerable/none/empty. Normalizationtakes precedence over all other ruleswhen determining equivalence. —Important Rules— • If the candidate answer fails to provide an answer (e.g., says "I don’t know")when the reference is answerable, it must receive ascore of 0. • If the reference answer is
