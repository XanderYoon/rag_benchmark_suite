further explore parametric optimization by fine-tuning a pretrained Large Vision–Language Model (LVLM) on a curated set of high-quality multimodalchunk-to-queryexemplars. Each train- ing instance consists of a multimodal chunk 𝑐 (including text, an image with its caption, or a table with structured content) paired with a set of human-curated or automatically synthesized answer- able query–answer (𝑞, 𝑎) pairs. The LVLM is trained using stan- dard teacher forcing, where the model conditions on the input chunk to generate the corresponding answer and subsequently au- toregressively decodes the associated queries. Through parametric adaptation, the model learns to produce more semantically pre- cise, context-aware, and structurally grounded queries, thereby improving the expressiveness and reliability of MDoc2Query for downstream MCQG construction. 4 Experimental Setup In this section, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed ML- DocRAG framework for multimodal long-context document ques- tion answering (QA), and compare it with existing approaches (as illustrated in Figure 1). Specifically, our experimental study is de- signed to address the following research questions: •RQ1:How does MLDocRAG perform on multimodal long-context document QA compared with baseline methods? •RQ2:What are the effects on MLDocRAG of different MCQG node variants, including query node choices (query vs. answer), chunk ranking strategies (max vs. mean), and visual noise filtering? •RQ3:How do key hyperparameters of MCQG usage affect the per- formance of MLDocRAG, such as expansion hopsℎ, KNN neighbors 𝑘, and max nodes𝑛? •RQ4:What is the impact of MDoc2Query optimization from both non-parametric and parametric perspectives? 4.1 Datasets & Metrics Datasets.We evaluate our MLDocRAG on two multimodal long- context document QA benchmarks: (1)MMLongBench-Doc[ 25]: A curated benchmark for multimodal long-document understand- ing, consisting of documents in PDF format with diverse content including text, images, tables, and charts. Questions are paired with answerable evidence spread across pages and modalities. (2) Conference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018,
