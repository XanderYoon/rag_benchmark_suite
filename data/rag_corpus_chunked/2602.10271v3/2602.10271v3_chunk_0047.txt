administration officials as excellent (9%) or good (30%). •58% say they are not good (21%) or poor (36%). (4) Specifically, the text states: “58% say they are not good (21%) or poor (36%). ” This means 36% of the adults rated Trump’s government ethical standards as “poor. ” (5) The survey sample size is 1,503 adults. (6) To find the number of adults who rated Trump’s government ethical standards as “poor, ” we calculate: •36% of 1,503 = 0.36×1,503 = 541.08 Since we can’t have a fraction of a person, we round to the nearest whole number. Final Answer: 541 Section 5.5 presents a QA example on MMLongBench-Doc with detailed result comparisons; in this section, we further supplement the example with two evidence page images. QA Example 2 on MMLongBench-Doc Souce evidence images: Question:Which step in Figure 1 maps to the content of Figure 10?
