context are provided in Appendix C. Further- more,MLDocRAG 𝑃 𝑃 integrates page-level information at both the query generation and answer generation stages, achieving the best overall performance. This result confirms that supplying reference page context throughout both retrieval indexing and QA stages maximizes evidence utilization.(2) Parametric Optimization. MLDocRAG remains effective when deployed with smaller LVLMs. Although the 32B model achieves the strongest overall performance, the 7B model with supervised fine-tuning (MLDocRAG w/ 7B SFT) attains 50.1% accuracy on LongDocURL, closely matching the 32B baseline (50.8%). These results demonstrate that MLDocRAG can be efficiently adapted to resource-constrained models through para- metric optimization. 5.5 Use Case Figure 7 illustrates a representative use case from MMLongBench- Doc that requires cross-modal reasoning across distant scientific diagrams (Pages 3 and 14). In contrast to baseline methods such as 𝑅𝐴𝐺𝑡𝑥𝑡+𝑖2𝑡 BGE-m3 and 𝑉 𝑅𝐴𝐺𝑝𝑎𝑔𝑒 ColPali, which fail to bridge this long-context Question & Answer✓ Question: Which step in Figure 1 maps to the content of Figure 10? Evidence Pages:[3, 14] Ground Truth:Deletion/duplication/rearrangement of the genetic material and Genetic diseases. RAGtxt+i2t BGE-m3 /times Response: The question asks which step inFigure 1(Pathogenesis of genetic diseases) maps to the content ofFigure 10. However, the provided context does not include any information about Figure 10. Since the content of Figure 10 is not described in the given text, it is impossible to determine which step in Figure 1 corresponds to it. Final Answer: I don’t know. VRAGpage ColPali /times Response: The question asks which step inFigure 1maps to the content ofFigure 10. However, the provided images and text do not include either Figure 1 or Figure 10. Without these figures, it is impossible to determine the mapping between them. Final Answer: I don’t know. MLDocRAG✓ Response: To determine which step in Figure 1 maps to the content of Figure 10,
