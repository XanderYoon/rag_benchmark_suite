—Output Format— Return only a JSON array of objects. Each object must include: •"index": a zero-based integer •"query": the generated question •"answer": the exact answer Adjust the number of queries according to the information richness of the text and image (0–20 queries). [ {"index": 0, "query": "Where did Alice and Bob meet?", "answer": " Central Cafe"}, {"index": 1, "query": "When did the meeting take place?", "answer": "Tuesday"} ] A.2 Page-Context-Aware MDoc2Query Prompt Page-Context-Aware MDoc2Query Prompt —Role— You are an expert **Document Understanding AI** designed to build a high-precision Retrieval Graph. —Inputs— (1) Target Chunk:A specific segment of content (Text, Cropped Image, or Table Data) extracted from a document. (2) Source Page Image:The original full-page screenshot where this chunk is located. —Workflow (Strict Execution Order)— Step 1: Visual Localization & Context Recovery (Mental Scratchpad) Locate: First, look at the Source Page Image and identify exactly where the Target Chunk is located. Scan Surroundings: Look immediately above, below, and to the sides of the chunk location in the full page. Identify Missing Context: Find any informationnotinside the chunk but essential for understanding it. This includes: •Headers: Section Titles, Page Headers, Chapter Names. • Captions: Figure Titles (e.g., "Figure 3: Revenue Trend"), Table Headers, or Axis Labels that were cut off. • Pre-text: Preceding sentences that define what "this table" or "the data below" refers to. Step 2: Adaptive Query Generation Based on the chunk’s content and the recovered context from Step 1, gener- ate a set of 5 to 20 Query-Answer pairs. Quantity Rule:If the chunk is dense (e.g., a complex table or dense text), generate closer to 20. If it is sparse, generate closer to 5. Coverage Rule:You must generate queries for all 4 Levels defined below. The distribution ratio is up to you based on the content type. —Query Level
