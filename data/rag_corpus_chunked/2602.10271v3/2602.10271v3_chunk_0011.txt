(C-Q) Edges: Each query 𝑞 (𝑗) 𝑖 is connected to its originating chunk 𝑐𝑖 via a directed anchor edge. (2)Query–Query (Q-Q) Edges: We compute semantic similarity between queries using inner product of embeddings and connect each query to its top-𝑘nearest neighbors (KNN): sim(𝑞, 𝑞′)=⟨𝜙( [𝑞;𝑎]), 𝜙( [𝑞 ′;𝑎 ′])⟩ +𝜖.(5) Here, 𝑞 and 𝑞′ denote two generated queries. ⟨·,·⟩ denotes the inner product. All query embeddings are ℓ2-normalized prior to similarity computation. The constant offset 𝜖 (e.g., 𝜖= 1.0) is added to ensure non-negative similarity scores for stable KNN construction. This dual-edge structure allows the graph to capture both local chunk associations and global semantic neighborhoods across queries, enabling multi-hop traversal and cross-modal reasoning during retrieval. (4) Storage.To support scalable and efficient retrieval, we decou- ple vector retrieval from graph traversal by storing: (1) Query–Answer vectors {v(𝑗) 𝑖 } in a densevector database(e.g., FAISS [ 10], Elastic- Search [22]), supporting fast approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search [2]. (2) The full MCQG graph structure in agraph data- base(e.g., Neo4j [17]), preserving chunk–query and query–query relationships. Importantly, we donotperform vectorization of multimodal chunks (e.g., figure or table content) directly. Instead, all retrieval operates in the query–answer space, thereby avoiding the need for complex multimodal embedding alignment and reducing storage and computation overhead. The generated queries serve as inter- pretable, semantically rich anchors that effectively summarize and index the multimodal document content. 3.4 MCQG Usage The MCQG Usage stage aims to retrieve semantically relevant mul- timodal content in response to a user query by leveraging the struc- ture of the Multimodal Chunk-Query Graph (MCQG). Rather than retrieving from raw document chunks, our MLDocRAG approach retrieves and aggregates content via generated queries that serve as semantically aligned retrieval anchors. This process involves four main steps: (1) Query Node Retrieval, (2) Chunk Node Ranking, (3)
