The question asks which step inFigure 1maps to the content ofFigure 10. However, the provided images and text do not include either Figure 1 or Figure 10. Without these figures, it is impossible to determine the mapping between them. Final Answer: I don’t know. MLDocRAG✓ Response: To determine which step in Figure 1 maps to the content of Figure 10, let’s analyze both figures step by step. Figure 1: Pathogenesis of Genetic Diseases. Figure 1 outlines a sequence of events leading to genetic diseases: (1)Mutation (2)Deletion / Duplication / Rearrangement of Genetic Material (3)Deficient / Defective Transcription of mRNA (4)Deficient / Defective Post-Transcriptional Modifications of mRNA (5)Deficient / Defective Translation of mRNA (6)Deficient / Defective Production of Proteins / Regulatory Factors (7)Deficient / Defective Post-Translational Modifications of Proteins (8)Disturbed Function(s) of Metabolic Networks (9)Patho-Physiological Alterations of Cellular Functions (10)Genetic Disease Figure 10: Pathological Consequences of Genomic Structural and Functional Mutations. Figure 10 illustrates the consequences of genomic imprinting defects and chromosomal abnormalities, specifically: •Structural and numerical chromosomal mutationsleading to altered genetic material. • The resulting phenotypes (e.g., normal zygote, gynogenetic constitution, and androgenetic constitution) are shown. Mapping the Content. Figure 10 focuses on the consequences ofstructural and numerical chromosomal mutations, which directly correspond to the second step in Figure 1:Deletion / Duplication / Rearrangement of Genetic Material. The phenotypes shown in Figure 10 (e.g., normal zygote, gynogenetic constitution, and androgenetic constitution) are the downstream effects of these chromosomal mutations, aligning with the pathogenesis outlined in Figure 1. Final Answer: Deletion / Duplication / Rearrangement of Genetic Material. Figure 7: Use Case on MMLongBench-Doc. gap, MLDocRAG successfully retrieves the dispersed evidence and performs the required multi-hop reasoning. Specifically, MLDocRAG accurately aligns the “chromosomal mutations” visually depicted in “Figure 10” on Page 14 with the corresponding “Deletion / Duplica- tion / Rearrangement”
