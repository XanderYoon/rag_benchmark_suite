In addition, we evaluate several variants of the proposed ML- DocRAG framework under different MCQG construction and usage settings to analyze the effects of key components and hyperparam- eters:(1) Node Variants.(i)MLDocRAG w/ Queryto use queries only as nodes; (ii)MLDocRAG w/ Answerto use answers only as nodes; (iii)MLDocRAG w/ Meanto apply mean semantic similarity for chunk node ranking instead of the max operation; (iv)ML- DocRAG w/o Filterto disable visual noise filtering during document parsing.(2) Hyperparameters.(i)Hops ℎ∈ { 0, 1, 2, 3} for multi- hop neighbor expansion; (ii)KNN 𝑘∈ { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} for query-query edges; (iii)Max Nodes 𝑛∈ { 5, 10, 15, 20} for query node retrieval. We additionally compare different query node retrieval backends (BGE-m3 vs. BM25) and similarity thresholds 𝛼∈ { 1.0, 1.2}. Note that MLDocRAG performs chunk-only query generation by default, whereas MLDocRAG𝑃 and MLDocRAG𝑃 𝑃 additionally incorporate page context during query generation and final answer generation, respectively. 4.3 Setup Details Document Parsing Setting.Multimodal long-context documents are parsed using MinerU [40], which extracts layout-ordered ele- ments from PDF into structured JSON files. Chunks are constructed as follows: (1) Text: Paragraphs are segmented using a maximum length of 1200 tokens with an overlap of 100 tokens. Equations parsed as Markdown are treated as regular text. (2) Image: Figures and tables, together with their captions and OCR-derived content, are treated as individual image-modality chunks. In addition, doc-
