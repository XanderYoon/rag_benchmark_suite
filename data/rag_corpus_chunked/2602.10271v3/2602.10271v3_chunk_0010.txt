∈ C , we employ a Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to generate a set of answerable query–answer pairs: Q𝑖 = n (𝑞 (1) 𝑖 , 𝑎(1) 𝑖 ), . . . ,(𝑞 (𝑀𝑖 ) 𝑖 , 𝑎(𝑀𝑖 ) 𝑖 ) o , 𝑀 𝑖 ≤𝑀 max.(2) Conference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY Yongyue Zhang and Yaxiong Wu Figure 2: Overview of our proposed MLDocRAG framework, consisting of (a)MCQG Constructionfor building a multimodal chuck-query graph and (b)MCQG Usagefor retrieving relevant multimodal chunks in long-document QA. Here, 𝑞 (𝑗) 𝑖 denotes a generated query and 𝑎 (𝑗) 𝑖 its corresponding answer, both grounded in chunk 𝑐𝑖. The number of pairs per chunk is adaptively determined by the richness of its content, up to a global cap 𝑀max per chunk. Each query–answer pair (𝑞 (𝑗) 𝑖 , 𝑎(𝑗) 𝑖 ) is embedded into a dense vector representation using a pretrained text encoder𝜙(·)(e.g., BGE-m3 [5]): v(𝑗) 𝑖 =𝜙  [𝑞 (𝑗) 𝑖 ;𝑎 (𝑗) 𝑖 ]  ∈R 𝑑,(3) where [𝑞; 𝑎] denotes concatenation of the query and answer as the retrieval unit. We simplify notation in the remainder of the paper by referring to𝑞 (𝑗) 𝑖 as a shorthand for the full query–answer pair. (3) Graph Assembly.We build the Multimodal Chunk-Query Graph (MCQG) as a heterogeneous graph G=(V,E) with nodes: V=C ∪ Q,whereQ= 𝑁Ø 𝑖=1 Q𝑖 .(4) Nodes in V includeChunk Nodes C andQuery Nodes Q. Edges in E include: (1)Chunk–Query (C-Q) Edges: Each query 𝑞 (𝑗) 𝑖 is connected to its originating chunk 𝑐𝑖 via a directed anchor edge. (2)Query–Query (Q-Q) Edges: We compute semantic similarity between queries using inner product of embeddings and connect each query to its top-𝑘nearest neighbors (KNN): sim(𝑞, 𝑞′)=⟨𝜙( [𝑞;𝑎]), 𝜙( [𝑞 ′;𝑎 ′])⟩ +𝜖.(5) Here, 𝑞 and 𝑞′ denote two generated queries. ⟨·,·⟩ denotes
