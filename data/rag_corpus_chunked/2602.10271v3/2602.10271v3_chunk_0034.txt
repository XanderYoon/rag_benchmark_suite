MLDocRAG: Multimodal Long-Context Document Retrieval Augmented Generation Conference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY A LLM Prompt The following are some LLM prompts for query generation and answer evaluation, including MDoc2Query Prompt, Page-Context- Aware MDoc2Query Prompt, Response Generation Prompt, Page- Context-Aware Response Generation and Evaluation Prompt. A.1 MDoc2Query Prompt MDoc2Query Prompt —Role— You are aDoc2Queryassistant. —Goal— Given a text chunk and image, generate no more than 20 distinct user queries that can be directly answered by that provided text chunk and image. For each query, also provide an exact answer and a relevance score. —Generation Rules— (1) Answerability:Every query must be answerable usingonlyinfor- mation in the text chunk and image. (2) Comprehensive coverage:Collectively, all generated queries should cover all key ideas in the text chunk and image from differ- ent viewpoints or levels of detail. (3) Adaptive quantity:Adjust the number of generated queries (0-20) according to the semantic richness and information value of both text and image. (4) Diversity requirements:Ensure diversity along the following dimensions: • Question-style variety:Mix interrogative forms (who/what/why/how/where/when/did), imperative prompts ("List... ", "Summarize... "), comparative questions, conditional or speculative forms, etc. • Content-perspective variety:Include queries on facts, definitions, methods, reasons, outcomes, examples, comparisons, limita- tions, and so on. • Information granularity:Combine macro (overall purpose, high- level summary) and micro (specific figures, terms, steps) queries. • User-intent variety:Simulate intents such as confirmation, eval- uation, usability, diagnosis, and decision-making (e.g., "Is this approach more efficient than...?"). • Linguistic expression variety:Vary wording, syntax
