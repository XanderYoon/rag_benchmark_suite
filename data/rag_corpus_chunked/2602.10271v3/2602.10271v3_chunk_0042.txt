B Details of Visual Noise Filtering We employ clip-vit-base-patch32 to classify visual chunks via zero-shot inference. Based on their semantic relevance to the RAG task, visual elements are partitioned into two sets: those retained for indexing and those filtered as decorative noise. Table 2 lists the specific labels for each action. Retain table, chart, graph, diagram, map, infographic, equation, flow chart, scatter plot, bar chart, form Filter logo, banner, advertisement, poster, cover, illustration, background, icon, photo, texture Table 2: Visual chunk classification and filtering actions. Rationale:Elements labeled for filtering are pruned to eliminate redundant visual noise (e.g., repeating logos) and enhance the pre- cision of the embedding space during retrieval. C MDoc2Query Example There are some query-answer pair examples generated by MDoc2Query and Page-Context-Aware MDoc2Query. The multimodal chunk and corresponding page image as follows: Multimodal Chunk with Page Image { "type": "image", "text": "", "image": [ "./images/9bc7afb9a74e615b67303104c415d.jpg" ], "visual_context": "./visual_context/a325667e4e534f96.png" } Chunk Image: Corresponding Page Image: Doc2Query Example [ { "index": 0, "query": "Which app store had more apps in 2015?", "answer": "Google Play Store", "q_id": "reportq32015-151009093138-lva1-app6891_95-6-0" }, { "index": 1, "query": "How many apps were in the Apple App Store in 2015?", "answer": "1,5 million", "q_id": "reportq32015-151009093138-lva1-app6891_95-6-1" }, { "index": 2, "query": "What was the number of apps in the Google Play Store in 2015?", "answer": "1,6 million", "q_id": "reportq32015-151009093138-lva1-app6891_95-6-2" }, { "index": 3, "query": "In which year did the number of apps in both stores start to increase significantly?", "answer": "2013", "q_id": "reportq32015-151009093138-lva1-app6891_95-6-3" }, { "index": 4, "query": "How many apps were in the Apple App Store in 2012?", "answer": "0,5 million", "q_id": "reportq32015-151009093138-lva1-app6891_95-6-4" }, { "index": 5, "query": "What was the number of apps
