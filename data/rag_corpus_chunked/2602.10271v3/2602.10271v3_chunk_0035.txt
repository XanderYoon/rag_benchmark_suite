etc. • Content-perspective variety:Include queries on facts, definitions, methods, reasons, outcomes, examples, comparisons, limita- tions, and so on. • Information granularity:Combine macro (overall purpose, high- level summary) and micro (specific figures, terms, steps) queries. • User-intent variety:Simulate intents such as confirmation, eval- uation, usability, diagnosis, and decision-making (e.g., "Is this approach more efficient than...?"). • Linguistic expression variety:Vary wording, syntax (active ↔ passive), and synonyms; avoid repeating near-identical phrases. • No redundancy:Each query must be meaningfully distinct; elim- inate trivial rephrases that offer no new angle. • Chunk-grounded specificity:Queries must be grounded in spe- cific factual points from the text chunk and image. Avoid vague or generic formulations such as "What did X say?" or "Tell me more about Y" that lack anchoring in actual content.

Each object must include: •"index": a zero-based integer •"query": the generated question •"answer": the exact answer Adjust the number of queries according to the information richness of the text and image (0–20 queries).
