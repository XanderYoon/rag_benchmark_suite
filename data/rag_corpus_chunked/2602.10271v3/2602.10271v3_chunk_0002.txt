Representative examples include GPT-4o [20], Gem- ini [35], Qwen2.5-VL [3], and InternVL [6], which demonstrate im- pressive performance on short-range multimodal reasoning bench- marks [23, 43]. However, they often struggle to maintain consistent semantic modeling within limited context windows when applied to long-document scenarios [24]. In particular, their performance deteriorates when evidence is sparsely distributed across pages and modalities by overlooking the relevant information, leading to the so-called “needle in a haystack” problem [41, 42]. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promis- ing paradigm for overcoming the limited context windows of large models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision- Language Models (LVLMs), by incorporating external retrieval [1, 26, 50]. In multimodal document scenarios, existing RAG approaches typically follow five strategies (as shown in Figure 1): (a)𝑅𝐴𝐺𝑡𝑥𝑡 𝐷𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒 : converting multimodal content into plain text via Optical Char- acter Recognition (OCR) [ 32] and applying textual chunk-based RAG with LLMs [48] and dense retrievers (e.g., BGE-m3 [5]); (b) 𝑅𝐴𝐺𝑡𝑥𝑡+𝑖2𝑡 𝐷𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒 : generating image descriptions (e.g., Image2Text (i2t) [18]) and fusing them with OCR text using document content extrac- tion toolkits (e.g., MinerU [40]) for textual chunk-based RAG; (c) 𝑀𝑅𝐴𝐺 𝑡𝑥𝑡+𝑖𝑚𝑔 𝐶𝐿𝐼 𝑃 : encoding text and images into a shared embedding space via multimodal encoders (e.g., CLIP [ 29], SigLIP [ 37, 47]) for retrieval followed by LVLM-based generation; (d) 𝑉 𝑅𝐴𝐺𝑝𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝐶𝑜𝑙𝑃𝑎𝑙𝑖 : rendering document pages as images and retrieving relevant page- level content using vision-based methods (e.g., ColPali [14]) prior to LVLM decoding; and (e)𝐺𝑟𝑎𝑝ℎ𝑅𝐴𝐺 𝑡𝑥𝑡+𝑖2𝑡 𝐷𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒 : constructing knowledge graphs (KGs) from document content and applying Graph-based RAG [11, 13]. However, these approaches often struggle to capture fine-grained cross-modal and cross-page associations, leading to incomplete grounding and suboptimal retrieval. Document expansion methods such as Doc2Query [27] provide a principled way to map document
