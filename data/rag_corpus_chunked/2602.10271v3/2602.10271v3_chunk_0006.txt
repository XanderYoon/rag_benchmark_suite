intro- duces a query-centric graph structure that connects queries to their source textual chunks, enabling multi-hop retrieval and structured evidence aggregation in long-document scenarios. Yet, these meth- ods remain unimodal, lacking explicit modeling of cross-modal relationships. Extending query-centric expansion to multimodal documents remains an open problem for capturing fine-grained, heterogeneous associations. MLDocRAG: Multimodal Long-Context Document Retrieval Augmented Generation Conference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY 3 Methodology 3.1 Preliminaries We consider the task of multimodal long-context document question answering, where the goal is to answer a user natural language question 𝑞𝑢 based on a multimodal long-context document 𝐷 that spans multiple pages and contains heterogeneous content. Each document 𝐷 originates from a PDF file and is processed into a sequence of pages 𝐷={𝑃 1, 𝑃2, . . . , 𝑃𝑋 } via OCR. Each page 𝑃𝑥 consists of a set of modality-specific chunks 𝐶𝑖 ={𝑐 1, 𝑐2, . . . , 𝑐𝑁 }, where each chunk 𝑐 is associated with a modality (text ( 𝑡𝑥𝑡 ) or image (𝑖𝑚𝑔)) and a content type (e.g., paragraph, figure, table, or equation). Text chunks are contiguous paragraphs or extracted titles; image chunks consist of a visual region paired with an associated caption; table chunks include a caption, a rendered table image, and an OCR- converted Markdown-style textual representation [40]. The QA task follows a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) paradigm: given a query 𝑞, a retriever selects the top-𝐾 relevant multimodal chunks {𝑐′ 1, . . . , 𝑐′ 𝐾 } from 𝐷, and a LVLM conditions on these chunks to generate the final answer ˆ𝑎. The primary challenge lies in retrieving semantically aligned and cross-modally grounded chunks from the long, heterogeneous document to support accurate and coherent generation. 3.2 Framework Overview To tackle the challenges of cross-modal heterogeneity and long- range reasoning in
