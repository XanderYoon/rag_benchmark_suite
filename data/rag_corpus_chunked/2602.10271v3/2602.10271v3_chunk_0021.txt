For MMLongBench-Doc, five formats are considered: text (TXT), layout (LAY), chart (CHA), table (TAB), and image (FIG), with scopes including single- page (SIN), multi-page (MUL), and unanswerable (UNA). For LongDocURL, four formats are evaluated: text (TXT), layout (LAY), table (TAB), and figures (FIG), with evidence spans categorized as single-page (SP), multi-page (MP), or cross-element (CE), where CE denotes the integration of multiple modalities. Best results are shown in bold, and second-best results are underlined.

As a re- sult, MLDocRAG delivers consistent gains across different evidence sources and document scopes, demonstrating superior grounding and robustness for multimodal long-context document question answering. 5.2 Impact of Node Variants (RQ2) Figure 3 analyzes the impact of different MCQG node variants on the performance of MLDocRAG.(1) Query Node Choices (Query vs. Answer).Generated queries play a dominant role in performance. WhileMLDocRAG w/ Queryremains relatively stable,MLDocRAG w/ Answerexhibits substantial performance degradation (dropping below 39% on MMLongBench-Doc), indicating
