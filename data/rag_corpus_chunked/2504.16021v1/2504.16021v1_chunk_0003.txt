assistive augmentation [9]. With recent developments in multimodal AI models [1, 6, 11], deriving contextual awareness becomes a matter of mapping input modalities to cognitive assistance and understanding when, what, and how to intervene. By leveraging multimodal cues, such as gaze behavior, typing hesitation, and interaction patterns, AI systems can infer cognitive load and deliver interventions at moments that sustain deep reasoning rather than hinder it. Furthermore, longitudinal engagement data can be utilized to cluster users based on preferred reasoning styles and cognitive engagement patterns, enabling AI systems to personalize augmentation strategies more effectively. By grounding AI-augmented reasoning systems in Flow Theory, we can shift from rigid, one-size-fits-all intervention models to truly adaptive cognitive assistants that support reasoning in a natural, personalized, and minimally disruptive way. This approach has the potential to enhance critical thinking without breaking immersion, making AI-augmented reasoning a more intuitive and effective tool for human cognition. 2 State of Flow –> State of Cognitive Flow One of the fundamental questions in positive psychology concerns the nature of a good life . Flow theory offers one perspective, emphasizing deep engagement and full immersion in an activity as a key component of well-being. Csikszentmihalyi [3, 8] defines flow as a psychological state in which individuals experience complete absorption in a task, striking an optimal balance between challenge and skill. When this balance is achieved, individuals remain fully engaged, motivated, and focused on the task at hand. Because flow is shaped by both personal and environmental factors, it represents an emergent motivational process [3]. That is the goals and motivations driving an individual’s engagement evolve dynamically in response to immediate situational factors rather than being dictated solely by predefined traits, roles, or scripts. This dynamic nature is particularly relevant in the context of AI-augmented cognitive interventions, where external assistance
