Navigating the State of Cognitive Flow: Context-Aware AI Interventions for Effective Reasoning Support DINITHI DISSANAYAKE, Augmented Human Lab, National University of Singapore, Singapore SURANGA NANAYAKKARA, Augmented Human Lab, National University of Singapore, Singapore Flow Theory describes an optimal cognitive state where individuals experience deep focus and intrinsic motivation when a task’s difficulty aligns with their skill level. In AI-augmented reasoning, interventions that disrupt the state of cognitive flow can hinder rather than enhance decision-making. This paper proposes a context-aware cognitive augmentation framework that adapts interventions based on three key contextual factors: type, timing, and scale. By leveraging multimodal behavioral cues (e.g., gaze behavior, typing hesitation, interaction speed), AI can dynamically adjust cognitive support to maintain or restore flow. We introduce the concept of cognitive flow, an extension of flow theory in AI-augmented reasoning, where interventions are personalized, adaptive, and minimally intrusive. By shifting from static interventions to context-aware augmentation, our approach ensures that AI systems support deep engagement in complex decision-making and reasoning without disrupting cognitive immersion. 1 Introduction The theory of flow, proposed by Csikszentmihalyi [ 3], defines an optimal psychological state in which individuals experience deep focus and intrinsic motivation when the challenge of a task is perfectly matched to their skill level. When a task is too easy, users become bored, while excessive difficulty leads to frustration. For example, in video games, the enjoyment of a game depends on several factors, including the player’s skill level and the challenge the game presents. A game that appropriately matches a player’s skill level fosters a sense of engagement, encouraging continued play. Similarly, any new intervention or augmentation should support the user in either attaining or maintaining the state of flow of whatever the current task the user is engaged in. In the domain of AI-augmented reasoning systems, the goal
