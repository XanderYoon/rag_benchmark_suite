is shaped by both personal and environmental factors, it represents an emergent motivational process [3]. That is the goals and motivations driving an individual’s engagement evolve dynamically in response to immediate situational factors rather than being dictated solely by predefined traits, roles, or scripts. This dynamic nature is particularly relevant in the context of AI-augmented cognitive interventions, where external assistance must be carefully calibrated to avoid disrupting or undermining an individual’s sense of agency and engagement, thereby positing the importance of contextual awareness for these external cognitive augmentation systems. For cognitive augmentation to be effective, it must support rather than disrupt the state of cognitive flow. The goal is to ensure that reasoning tasks remain appropriately challenging, not so difficult as to cause frustration, nor so easy Navigating the State of Cognitive Flow: Context-Aware AI Interventions for Effective Reasoning Support 3 Fig. 1. State of Cognitive Flow as to induce disengagement. AI-driven interventions can play a pivotal role in helping individuals reach or maintain cognitive flow by: • Enhancing reasoning when challenges exceed an individual’s current capabilities , providing just enough support to facilitate deeper engagement. • Increasing cognitive demand when tasks are too easy, introducing counterarguments, critiques, or prompts that encourage deeper critical thinking. Thus, we define the optimal cognitive state as cognitive flow (Figure 1), wherein AI-augmented reasoning systems dynamically adjust interventions to either challenge or sustain the user’s engagement level. By maintaining this balance, AI can foster a sense of agency in decision-making, ensuring that individuals feel they have arrived at conclusions through their own reasoning processes rather than external imposition. This approach aligns with the broader goal of empowering individuals to engage in more deliberate, reflective, and well-reasoned thought processes. 3 Bridging AI-Driven Behavioral Modeling with Cognitive Flow Recent advances in AI and the increasing availability
