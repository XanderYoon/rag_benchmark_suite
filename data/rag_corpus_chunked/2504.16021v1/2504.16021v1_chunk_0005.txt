a sense of agency in decision-making, ensuring that individuals feel they have arrived at conclusions through their own reasoning processes rather than external imposition. This approach aligns with the broader goal of empowering individuals to engage in more deliberate, reflective, and well-reasoned thought processes. 3 Bridging AI-Driven Behavioral Modeling with Cognitive Flow Recent advances in AI and the increasing availability of large-scale multimodal datasets have made it possible to model human behavior with unprecedented granularity. By leveraging behavioral cues—such as gaze anticipation, gesture patterns, typing patterns, and physiological signals—AI systems can infer user states and dynamically adapt cognitive interventions [2, 12]. This enables a shift from static, one-size-fits-all interventions to context-aware augmentation strategies tailored to an individual’s cognitive state. In the context of cognitive flow, AI systems must intelligently map multimodal inputs to determine whether an individual is in a state of deep engagement, facing cognitive overload, or experiencing disengagement due to insufficient challenge. Learned representations derived from behavioral data provide a means to infer cognitive load and engagement levels, enabling real-time adjustments to interventions. By balancing challenge and support based on real-time multimodal inputs, the system ensures that users neither disengage due to excessive difficulty nor lose interest due to low complexity. By integrating context-aware AI-driven augmentation with flow theory, we move toward systems that do more than assist with reasoning—they optimize the conditions under which reasoning and critical thinking can thrive. Rather than disrupting engagement, AI enhances 4 Dinithi Dissanayake and Suranga Nanayakkara cognition in ways that feel seamless and natural, preserving a sense of agency while fostering deeper intellectual engagement. 4 Call to Action This paper presents a case for the importance of context awareness in AI-driven cognitive interventions. We introduce the concept of Cognitive Flow Alignment, emphasizing that interventions are most effective when they dynamically adjust
