• Leiden: Replaces our clustering framework with Leiden. • Single-Layer: Replaces our hierarchical index and search with a single-layer community. • Entity-Only: Generate the response using entities only. • Direct Prompt: Direct prompts the LLM to generate the response without the adaptive filtering-based generation. As shown in Table 3, the performance of ArchRAG on specific QA tasks decreases when each feature is removed, with the removal of the community component resulting in the most significant drop. Additionally, the direct vari- ant demonstrates that the adaptive filtering-based generation process can effectively extract relevant information from re- trieved elements. • Impact of Attributed Communities in RAG. We propose a new variant, GraphRAG+AC, which replaces the original Leiden-based communities in GraphRAG with our ACs, while preserving the original Global Search pipeline. As shown in Table 4, this variant results in a significant per- formance improvement compared to the original approach. Specifically, on the HotpotQA dataset, GraphRAG+AC im- proves accuracy by 51% compared to GGraphRAG. We further test ArchRAG under different LLM back- bones, various top-k retrieval settings, and evaluate the Table 3: Comparing the performance of different variants of ArchRAG on the specific QA tasks. Acc and Rec denote Accuracy and Recall, respectively. Method variants Multihop-RAG HotpotQA (Acc) (Rec) (Acc) (Rec) ArchRAG 68.8 37.2 65.4 69.2 - Spec. 67.1 36.7 60.5 63.7 - Spec.
