return H; Complexity analysis of ArchRAG We now analyze the complexity of our ArchRAG approach. Since the token cost is more important in the era of LLM, we replace the space complexity with the token cost. The offline indexing process of ArchRAG includes the KG construction, hierarchical clustering, and C-HNSW con- struction. The time complexity and token usage are as fol- lows: Lemma 1. Given a large text corpus or a large set of text documents with a total of D tokens, the time complexity of the offline indexing process of ArchRAG isO(I D w + 1−aL 1−a (n∗ t + I D w + π(m) + n log n)), where I is the generation time of the LLM for a single inference, w is the specified token size of one chunk, n and m are the number of entities and relations in the extracted KG,L is the height of the resulting hierarchical community structure, anda is the average ratio of the number of nodes between two consecutive layers, with 0 < a < 1. For a given embedding model, the computation time for the embedding of an entity description is denoted by t, while a specific clustering method is typically a function of m, represented as π(m). Proof. For the corpus D, we use the LLM to infer and ex- tract the KG from each chunk of sizew, resulting in a cost of O(I D w ) for constructing the KG. Since the size of all com- munity summaries in a single layer would not exceed the length of the corpus, their LLM inference time is also less than O(I D w ). For each layer of clustering, the embedding of each point must be computed, and clustering is performed with time complexity of π(m). In the C-HNSW construc-
