(i.e., CHI and Cosine Similarity) generated by our attributed clustering algorithm compared to those produced by the Lei- den algorithm, which is used in GraphRAG for structural clustering. As shown in Table 7, our attribute-based cluster- ing consistently yields higher-quality communities. • More experiments on the additional dataset. We further conduct experiments on the RAG-QA Arena dataset (Han et al. 2024), a high-quality, multi-domain benchmark featuring human-annotated, coherent long-form answers. To the best of our capability, we use publicly avail- able data from five domains (including lifestyle, recreation, science, technology, and writing), selecting 200 questions per domain. Following prior work, we employ LLMs as evaluators to compare the RAG-generated responses with Table 6: Comparing ArchRAG with other RAG methods on the RAG-QA Area dataset. Each entry denotes the win ratio and win + tie ratio of the corresponding method against the ground-truth annotations, based on LLM evaluation.
