the KG. Since the size of all com- munity summaries in a single layer would not exceed the length of the corpus, their LLM inference time is also less than O(I D w ). For each layer of clustering, the embedding of each point must be computed, and clustering is performed with time complexity of π(m). In the C-HNSW construc- tion, each point requires O(nlogn) time to perform the k- nearest neighbor search and establish connections, which is similar to the proof in (Malkov and Yashunin 2018). For an L-layer multi-layer graph structure, where the number of nodes decreases by a factor of a between two consecutive layers, the increase in clustering and C-HNSW construction time is given by: 1−aL 1−a . Lemma 2. Given a large text corpus or a large set of text documents with a total of D tokens, the number of to- kens used in the offline indexing process of ArchRAG is O(D(1 + 1−aL 1−a )), where L is the height of the resulting hi- erarchical community structure anda is the average ratio of the number of nodes between two consecutive layers, with 0 < a < 1. Proof. Based on the above proof, the token cost for con- structing the KG is O(D), while the token cost for the sum- maries does not exceed O(D 1−aL 1−a ). Generally, L is O(log n), where n is the number of ex- tracted entities. However, due to the constraints of commu- nity clustering, L is typically constant, usually no greater than 5. Next, we analyze the time complexity and token usage in the online query process of the ArchRAG. Lemma 3. Given a C-HNSW withL layers constructed from a large text corpus or a large set of text documents, the time complexity of a sequentially executed
