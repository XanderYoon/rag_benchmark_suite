is the i−th cluster. ci is the centroid of cluster Ci. c is the overall centroid of the datasets. x is the feature of the target node. 2. Cosine Similarity (Sim) (Charikar 2002): Cosine similar- ity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vec- tors defined in an inner product space. In this paper, for each cluster, we calculate the similarity between the cen- troid of this cluster and each node in this cluster: Sim = 1 N CX i=1 X x∈Ci Cosine(x, ci). (4) N is the number of nodes. C is the number of clusters. Ci is the i-th cluster. ci is the centroid of cluster Ci. x is the feature of the target node. Cosine(x, y) = Pn i=1 xiyipPn i=1 x2 i pPn i=1 y2 i . (5) Implementation details We implement our ArchRAG in Python, while C-HNSW is implemented in C++ and provides a Python interface for integration. We implement C-HNSW using the FAISS framework and employ the inner product metric to mea- sure the proximity between two vectors. All the experi- ments were conducted on a Linux operating system run- ning on a machine with an Intel Xeon 2.0 GHz CPU, 1024GB of memory, and 8 NVIDIA GeForce RTX A5000 GPUs, each with 24 GB of memory. All methods uti- lize 10 concurrent LLM calls, and to maintain consis- tency, other parallel computations in the method, such as embedding calculations, also use 10 concurrent threads.

The graph augmen- tation methods we choose are the KNN algorithm, which computes the similarity between each node, and CODI- CIL (Ruan, Fuhry, and Parthasarathy 2013), which selects and adds the top
