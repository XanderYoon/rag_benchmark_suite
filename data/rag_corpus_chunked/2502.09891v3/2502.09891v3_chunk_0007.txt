sponses to both abstract and specific questions. Offline Indexing KG construction. ArchRAG builds a KG by prompting the LLM to extract entities and relations from each chunk of the text corpus D. Specifically, all text contexts are seg- mented into chunks based on specified chunk length, en- abling the LLM to extract entities and relations from each chunk using in-context learning (2020), thus forming sub- graphs. These subgraphs are then merged, with entities and relations that appear repeatedly across multiple subgraphs being consolidated by the LLM to generate a complete de- scription. Finally, we get a KG, denoted by G(V, E), where V and E are sets of vertices and edges, respectively, and each vertex and edge is associated with textual attributes. LLM-based hierarchical clustering. We propose an it- erative LLM-based hierarchical clustering framework that supports arbitrary graph augmentation (e.g., KNN connec- tions and CODICIL (2013)) and graph clustering algorithms (e.g., weighted Leiden (2019), weighted spectral clustering, and SCAN (2007)). Specifically, we propose to augment the KG by linking entities if their attribute similarities are larger than a threshold, and then associate each pair of linked en- tities with a weight denoting their attribute similarity value. Next, we generate the ACs using any given graph clustering algorithm. In this way, both node attributes and structural links are jointly considered during community detection. Algorithm 1 shows the above iterative clustering process. Given a graph augmentation method Aug, clustering algo- rithm GCluster and stopping condition T , we perform the following steps in each iteration: (1) augmenting the graph (line 3); (2) computing the edge weights (lines 4-5); (3) clus- tering the augmented graph (line 6); (4) generating a sum- mary for each community using LLM (line 7); and (5) build- ing a new attributed graph where each node denotes an AC
