To evaluate the contributions of different components, we design several ArchRAG vari- ants and conduct ablation experiments. These include two modifications to the LLM-based hierarchical clus- tering framework, three targeting core design elements in ArchRAG—attributes, hierarchy, and communities—and one direct prompting variant, as detailed below: • Spec.: Spectral clustering instead of weighted Leiden. • Spec. (No Aug): Spectral clustering without graph aug- mentation. • Leiden: Replaces our clustering framework with Leiden. • Single-Layer: Replaces our hierarchical index and search with a single-layer community. • Entity-Only: Generate the response using entities only. • Direct Prompt: Direct prompts the LLM to generate the response without the adaptive filtering-based generation. As shown in Table 3, the performance of ArchRAG on specific QA tasks decreases when each
