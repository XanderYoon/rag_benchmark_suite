reasoning. StructGPT (2023) and ToG (2023) treat LLMs as agents that interact with KGs to find reasoning paths leading to the correct answers. Our Approach ArchRAG We begin by presenting the overall workflow and design ra- tionale of ArchRAG, followed by detailed descriptions of each component. As illustrated in Figure 2, our proposed ArchRAG consists of two phases. In the offline indexing phase, ArchRAG first constructs a KG from the corpus, then detects ACs by a novel LLM-based hierarchical clustering method, and finally builds the C-HNSW index. During the online retrieval phase, ArchRAG first converts the question into a query vector, then retrieves relevant information from the C-HNSW index, and finally generates answers through an adaptive filtering-based generation process Our ArchRAG detects ACs by exploiting both links and attributes, and organizes ACs and entities into a novel hierar- chical index, C-HNSW, yielding the following advantages: Figure 2: ArchRAG consists of two phases: offline indexing and online retrieval. For the online retrieval phase, we show an example of using ArchRAG to answer a question in the HotpotQA dataset. 1) Each AC group densely connected entities with shared themes and a high-quality summary. 2) The hierarchical structure captures multiple levels of abstraction: lower-level entities and communities encode detailed KG knowledge, while higher-level communities provide global context, en- abling ArchRAG to address questions at varying granular- ity. and 3) The C-HNSW index efficiently retrieves relevant information across levels, supporting fast and accurate re- sponses to both abstract and specific questions. Offline Indexing KG construction. ArchRAG builds a KG by prompting the LLM to extract entities and relations from each chunk of the text corpus D. Specifically, all text contexts are seg- mented into chunks based on specified chunk length, en- abling the LLM to extract entities and relations from each chunk using in-context
