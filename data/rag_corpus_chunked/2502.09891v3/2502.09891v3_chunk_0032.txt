layer L0 by adding similar edges. Next, the weight of each edge is calculated based on the strength of the relationship between the node embeddings, and a weighted clustering algorithm is applied to obtain four communities. Based on the existence of links between nodes within a community, the topology of communities at layer L1 is constructed, resulting in a graph of communities. This process is repeated, ultimately generating a clustering result consisting of three layers of hierarchical communities. More details of C-HNSW • Introduction of HNSW. We provide a brief introduc- tion to HNSW, an efficient Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) technique for vector databases. Definition 1 (Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) (Malkov and Yashunin 2018)) . HNSW is a graph-based ANNS algorithm that consists of a multi-layered index struc- ture, where each node uniquely corresponds to a vector in the database. Given a set S containing n vectors, the con- structed HNSW can be represented as a pair H = ( G, C). G = {G0, G1, . . . , GL} is a set of simple graphs (also called layers) Gi = ( Vi, Ei), where i ∈ { 0, 1, . . . , L} and VL ⊂ VL−1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ V1 ⊂ V0 = S. C records the inter- layer mappings of edges between the same node across ad- jacent layers C = SL−1 i=0 {(v, ϕ(v))|v ∈ Vi, ϕ(v) ∈ Vi+1}, where ϕ(v) : Vi → Vi+1 is the mapping function for the same node across two adjacent layers. The nodes in the multi-layer graph of HNSW are orga- nized in a nested structure, where each node at each layer is connected to its nearest neighbors. During a query, the search begins at the top layer and quickly identifies the node closest
