ϕ(v) : Vi → Vi+1 is the mapping function for the same node across two adjacent layers. The nodes in the multi-layer graph of HNSW are orga- nized in a nested structure, where each node at each layer is connected to its nearest neighbors. During a query, the search begins at the top layer and quickly identifies the node closest to q through a greedy search. Then, through inter- layer mapping, the search proceeds to the next lower layer. This process continues until all approximate nearest neigh- bors are identified in G0. • The construction of C-HNSW. A naive approach to build the C-HNSW index is to build nodes first and then establish the two types of links by finding the nearest neigh- bors of each node. However, the process of finding the near- est neighbor is costly. To accelerate the construction, we pro- pose a top-down approach by borrowing the idea of HNSW construction. The construction of C-HNSW is illustrated in Algorithm 3. The construction algorithm of C-HNSW fol- lows a top-down approach. Using the query process of C- HNSW, we obtain the M nearest neighbors of each node in its layer, and the inter-layer links are continuously updated during this process. When inserting a node x at layer i , if the nearest neighbor at the layer i + 1 is cj, the inter-layer link of cj is updated in the following two cases: • Node cj does not have a inter-layer link to the layer i. • The distance from node cj to node x is smaller than the distance from cj to its previous nearest neighbor x′, i.e., d(cj, x) < d(cj, x′). After all nodes at layer i (i < L ) have been inserted, we check each node at layer i + 1 to
