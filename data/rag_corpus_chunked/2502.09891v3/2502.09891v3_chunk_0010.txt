a language model (e.g., nomic-embed-text (2024)). We next establish two types of links between these high- dimensional nodes, i.e., intra-layer and inter-layer links: • Intra-layer links: These links exist between nodes in the same layers. Specifically, for each node in each layer, we link it to at least M nearest neighbors within the same layer, where M is a predefined value, and the nearest neighbors are determined according to a given distance metric d. Thus, all the intra-layer links are edges in all the simple graphs: Lintra = SL i=0 Ei. • Inter-layer links: These links cross two adjacent lay- ers. Specifically, we link each node in each layer to its nearest neighbor in the next layer. As a result, all the inter-layer links can be represented as Linter =SL i=1{(v, ψ(v))|v ∈ Vi, ψ(v) ∈ Vi−1}, where ψ(·) : Vi → Vi−1 is the injective function that identifies the nearest neighbor of each node in the lower layer. For example, in Figure 2, the C-HNSW index has three layers (simple graphs), incorporating all the ACs. Within each layer, each node is connected to its two nearest neigh- bors via intra-layer links, denoted by undirected edges. The inter-layer links are represented by arrows, e.g., the green community at layer L1 is connected to the green entity (its nearest neighbor at layer L0). Intuitively, since the two types of links above are es- tablished based on nearest neighbors, C-HNSW allows us to quickly search the relevant information for a query by traversing along with these links. Note that C-HNSW is dif- ferent from HNSW since it has intra-layer links and each node exists in only one layer. • The construction of C-HNSW.We propose a top-down approach to build a C-HNSW. Specifically, by leveraging the query process of C-HNSW, which will be
