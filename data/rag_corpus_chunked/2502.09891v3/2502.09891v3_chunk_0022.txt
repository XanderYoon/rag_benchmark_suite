ArchRAG consistently achieves state-of-the-art perfor- mance across all backbones, remains robust under vary- ing top-k values, and demonstrates high-quality community detection. We also provide additional case studies of our ArchRAG, which illustrate the detailed workflow. Detailed experiments are provided in the appendix. Conclusion In this paper, we propose ArchRAG, a novel graph-based RAG approach, by augmenting the question using attributed communities from the knowledge graph built on the external corpus, and building a novel index for efficient retrieval of relevant information. Our experiments show that ArchRAG is highly effective and efficient. In the future, we will explore fast parallel graph-based RAG methods to process large- scale external corpus.
