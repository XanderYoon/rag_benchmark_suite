to quickly search the relevant information for a query by traversing along with these links. Note that C-HNSW is dif- ferent from HNSW since it has intra-layer links and each node exists in only one layer. • The construction of C-HNSW.We propose a top-down approach to build a C-HNSW. Specifically, by leveraging the query process of C-HNSW, which will be introduced in on- line retrieval, nodes are progressively inserted into the in- dex starting from the top layer, connecting intra-layer links within the same layer and updating the inter-layer links. For lack of space, we give the details of the construction algo- rithm in the appendix. Online retrieval In the online retrieval phase, after obtaining the query vector for a given question, ArchRAG generates the final answer by first conducting a hierarchical search on the C-HNSW index and then analyzing and filtering the retrieved information. Hierarchical search. We propose an efficient and fast re- trieval algorithm, hierarchical search, to retrieve nodes from each layer of the C-HNSW structure. Intuitively, retrieving nodes from a given layer in C-HNSW requires starting from the top layer and searching downward through two types of links (i.e., intra-layer and inter-layer links) to locate the nearest neighbors at the given layer. In contrast, our hierar- chical search algorithm accelerates this process by reusing intermediate results, the nearest neighbors found in higher layers, as the starting node for lower layers. This approach avoids redundant computations that would otherwise arise from repeatedly searching from the top layer, thereby en- abling efficient multi-layer retrieval. Algorithm 2 illustrates hierarchical search. Given the C- HNSW H, query point q, and the numberk of nearest neigh- bors to retrieve at each layer, the hierarchical search algo- rithm can be implemented by the following iterative process: 1.
