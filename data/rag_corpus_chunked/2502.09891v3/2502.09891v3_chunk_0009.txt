Recall that the ACs in ∆ form a tree structure, and the number of nodes de- creases as the layer level increases. Since this tree struc- ture is similar to the HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) index which is the most well-known index for ef- ficient ANN search (2018), we propose to map entities and ACs of∆ into high-dimensional nodes, and then build a uni- fied Community-based HNSW (C-HNSW) index for them. • The structure of C-HNSW. Conceptually, the C- HNSW index is a list of simple graphs with links between them, denoted by H = ( G, Linter) with G = {G0 = (V0, E0), G1 = (V1, E1), · · · , GL = (VL, EL)}, where Gi is a simple graph and each node of the simple graph cor- responds to an attributed community or entity. The number L of layers in H is the same as that of ∆. Specifically, for each attributed community or entity in the i-th layer of ∆, we map it to a high-dimensional node in the i-th layer of H by using a language model (e.g., nomic-embed-text (2024)). We next establish two types of links between these high- dimensional nodes, i.e., intra-layer and inter-layer links: • Intra-layer links: These links exist between nodes in the same layers. Specifically, for each node in each layer, we link it to at least M nearest neighbors within the same layer, where M is a predefined
