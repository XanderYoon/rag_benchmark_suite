case. Another thing to consider is how one identifies meaningful video clip segments to be summarized by the captioning models in the first place. In future works it would be interesting to study how generic video captioning and clip seg- mentation methods fare on different video domains (e.g. general knowledge vs. surveillance, etc.) and contrast those with strategies that adapt the various components in the processing pipeline for a target domain. Moreover, the audio signal incorporated in this study focuses on the spoken word, and for other domains it may be interesting to incorporate other aspects of the audio as well (e.g. descriptions of music or shifts in loudness could give hints to the overall tone or emotion of the scene).
