knowledge once solely based on the input. Increasingly powerful large LMs have also demonstrated abilities in more complex tasks that involve generating long-form output, such as long- form QA (Fan et al., 2019; Stelmakh et al., 2022), open-domain summarization (Cohen et al., 2021; Hayashi et al., 2021; Giorgi et al., 2022), and (chain-of-thought; CoT) reasoning (Wei et al., 2022; Ho et al., 2020; Geva et al., 2021; Hendrycks et al., 2020). In contrast to short-form generation, long-form generation presents complex informa- tion needs that are not always evident from the in- put alone. Similar to how humans gradually gather information as we create content such as papers, essays, or books, long-form generation with LMs would require gathering multiple pieces of knowl- edge throughout the generation process .
