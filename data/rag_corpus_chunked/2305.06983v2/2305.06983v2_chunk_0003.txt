Starting with the user input x and initial retrieval results Dx, FLARE iteratively generates a temporary next sentence (shown in gray italic) and check whether it contains low-probability tokens (indicated with underline). If so (step 2 and 3), the system retrieves relevant documents and regenerates the sentence. (e.g., Joe Biden) may not cover all aspects and de- tails. It is crucial to retrieve extra information as needed during generation, such as when generat- ing a certain aspect (e.g., Joe Biden’s education history) or a specific detail (e.g., the date of Joe Biden’s presidential campaign announcement). Several attempts have been made to retrieve mul- tiple times throughout generation. These attempts include methods that passively use the past context to retrieve additional information at a fixed interval (Khandelwal et al., 2020; Borgeaud et al., 2022; Ram et al., 2023; Trivedi et al., 2022) which might not accurately reflect what LMs intend to gener- ate in the future or retrieve at inappropriate points. Some works in multihop QA decompose the full question into sub-questions, each of which is used to retrieve extra information (Press et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2022; Khot et al., 2022; Khattab et al., 2022). We ask the following question: can we create a simple and generic retrieval augmented LM thatac- tively decides when and what to retrievethroughout the generation process, and are applicable to a va- riety of long-form generation tasks? We provide a generalized view of active retrieval augmented gen- eration. Our hypothesis regarding when to retrieve is that LMs
