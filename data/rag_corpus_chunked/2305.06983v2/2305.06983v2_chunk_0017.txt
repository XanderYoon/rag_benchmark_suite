FLARE outperforms all base- line on all tasks/datasets, indicating that FLARE is a generic method that can effectively retrieve additional information throughout the generation. Among various tasks, multihop QA shows the most significant improvement. This is largely due to the task’s clear definition and specific objective of producing the final answer through a 2-hop rea- soning process, which makes it easier for LMs to generate on-topic output. In contrast, ASQA and WikiAsp are more open-ended, which increases the difficulty of both generation and evaluation. The improvement on ASQA-hint is larger than that of ASQA because identifying ambiguous aspects is challenging even for humans in many cases, and providing a generic hint helps LMs to stay on topic. Thorough comparisons with baselines. The per- formance of all baselines on 2WikiMultihopQA are reported in Table 1. FLARE outperforms all baselines by a large margin, which confirms that forward-looking active retrieval is highly effective.

Previous-window (Borgeaud et al., 2022; Ram et al., 2023), previous-sentence (Trivedi et al., 2022), and ques- tion decomposition (Press et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2022) methods are reimplemented for fair comparisons. margins. The improvement of retrieving using the previous sentence is relatively small which we hy- pothesize is mainly because the previous sentence often describes entities or relations different from those in the next sentence in 2WikiMultihopQA. While the previous-window approach might use the first half of a sentence to retrieve information
