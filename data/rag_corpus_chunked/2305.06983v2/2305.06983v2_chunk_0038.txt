for multi-document summarization and provides a list of references to systems. We converted it into the open-domain setting by removing the associated references and instead gathering information from the open web. For “Generate a summary about Echo School (Ore- gon) including the following aspects: academics, history.”, the output we aim to generate is “# Aca- demics. In 2008, 91% of the school’s seniors re- ceived their high school diploma... # History. The class of 2008 was the 100th class in the school’s history.” where # is used to indicate aspects. We manually annotate 4 exemplars (Prompt D.10), and use the Bing search engine to retrieve 5 documents from the open web. To avoid leaking, we exclude several Wikipedia-related domains listed in Table 8 from Bing’s search results. C Hyperparameters Hyperparameters of FLARE on different datasets are listed in Table 9. D Prompts and Few-shot exemplars The prompt used to linearize multiple documents is shown in Prompt D.1. The prompt used in self- ask (Press et al., 2022) is shown in Prompt D.2. Prompts and exemplars of different tasks/datasets are shown in Prompt D.3, D.4, D.5, D.6, D.8, and D.10, respectively. Prompt D.1: document formatting Search results: [1] Document 1 [2] Document 2 ... The user input x Prompt D.2: multihop QA with self-ask Question: Who lived longer, Theodor Haecker or Harry Vaughan Watkins? Are follow up questions needed here: Yes. Follow up: How old was Theodor Haecker when he died? Intermediate answer: Theodor Haecker was 65 years old when he died. Follow up: How old was Harry Vaughan Watkins when he died?
