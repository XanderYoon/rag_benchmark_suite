time costs than Vanilla RAG and RbFT. This demonstrates that RbFT not only excels in performance but also offers a notable advantage in efficiency over other baseline models. On the other hand, RbFT is vertical to these methods and can be integrated with them to further enhance system robustness.

By addressing the critical vulnerabilities in RAG systems, specifically their susceptibility to defective retrieval results, RbFT equips LLMs with improved defensive capabilities. Our dual-task fine-tuning strategy mitigates the impact of defective retrieval inputs and ensures effective knowledge utilization even under adverse retrieval conditions. Extensive experimental evalu- ations demonstrate that RbFT significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of robustness and inference effi- ciency. Notably, RbFT maintains high effectiveness even in clean environments while offering reliable responses in high-defect set- tings, making it a robust and practical solution for real-world RAG applications. In future works, we plan to extend RbFT beyond QA tasks to a broader range of applications. Additionally, since RbFT is theoretically vertical to other baselines focusing on inference strategies and mechanisms, we intend to explore their integration to develop more efficient and robust RAG systems further.
