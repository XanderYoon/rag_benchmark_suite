adopted to generate the final answers, which are measured using the exact match (EM) metric. The tests are conducted using the aforementioned three types of retrieval defects and their mixture (i.e., randomly selecting one type of defective document for replacement). The defect replace- ment probability 𝜏 is set to {0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0}. As observed in Figure 2, various types of retrieval defects pose a significant threat to the reliability of the vanilla RAG system. Specifically, misleading counterfactual documents have the greatest impact on RAG systems, while even noisy documents that are relatively less harmful can be quite disruptive. When all input documents are noisy, accuracy drops to below 40% of the original. Therefore, the severe impact of retrieval defects on the reliability of RAG systems underscores the urgent need to enhance their robustness. 4 Robust Fine-Tuning (RbFT) As mentioned in the §1, since the performance of an RAG system heavily depends on the quality of the retrieved documents and the model’s ability to effectively utilize them, we aim to enhance the robustness of the overall RAG system by fine-tuning the LLM to strengthen its intrinsic defensive capabilities. Here, the robustness is reflected not only in the model’s ability to remain stable when confronted with retrieval defects or low-quality inputs but, more importantly, in its capacity to extract and utilize useful information effectively. Specifically, we believe that a well-defended LLM should possess the following two key characteristics: • Ability to assess the quality of input content. A robust LLM should effectively distinguish the quality of documents, deter- mining which documents are genuinely helpful in addressing the question and which are useless. On the one hand, distinguishing the input documents helps LLMs develop critical thinking and reduces their dependency on the retrieved results. On the other hand, accurate identification
