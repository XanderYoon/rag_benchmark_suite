we propose two corresponding fine-tuning tasks arXiv:2501.18365v1 [cs.CL] 30 Jan 2025 Conference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY Yiteng Tu, Weihang Su, Yujia Zhou, Yiqun Liu, Qingyao Ai aimed at strengthening the LLM’s overall defensive capabilities: Defects Detection and Utility Extraction, collectively referred to as Robust Fine-Tuning (RbFT). Specifically, we replace the original retrieved documents with defective ones and then train the LLM to (1) determine whether each document contains defects, thereby enhancing its ability to assess inputs critically; (2) generate the correct answers based on the defective inputs, improving its capa- bility to utilize useful information effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that our fine-tuning tasks can deliver superior perfor- mance in extremely challenging retrieval conditions, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art baseline methods. In summary, this paper makes three key contributions: (1) We conduct a comprehensive analysis of potential retrieval defects in RAG systems from the perspectives of the retrieval system (i.e., the retriever and the corpus) and find that LLMs are highly vulnerable to retrieval defects. (2) We propose RbFT, a set of fine-tuning tasks that improve LLMs’ ability to evaluate and utilize retrieved information, enhancing robustness against retrieval defects. (3) We conduct extensive experiments to show that RbFT can achieve superior performance under challenging retrieval conditions, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. 2 Related Work 2.1 Retrieval-Augmented Generation In recent years, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has gar- nered widespread attention in the field of natural language process- ing (NLP) and shown significant advantages in knowledge-intensive tasks [2, 9, 14, 18, 20, 24, 39, 46, 47]. Traditional RAG typically fol- lows the "Retrieval-then-Read" framework [ 2, 14, 19, 24], where an external retriever [28, 34, 37, 38, 57] or a complex retrieval sys- tem [35, 40] is adopted to search for relevant documents from a large-scale external corpus based on the user’s
