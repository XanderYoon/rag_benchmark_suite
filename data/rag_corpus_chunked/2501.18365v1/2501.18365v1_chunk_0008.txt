world scenarios, our work focuses on enhancing the capability of the generation component G to minimize their negative impact. 3.2 Retrieval Defects As mentioned above, due to the limitations of the retriever’s perfor- mance and the quality of the corpus, the retrieval component often cannot guarantee that all returned documents fully meet the user query’s information needs, resulting in various types of retrieval defects. These defects can be broadly categorized into three types: 3.2.1 Noisy Documents. Noisy documents refer to content that is relevant to the query topic but does not directly answer the query. For example, given the query in Figure 1: "Which album features the song ’Time’ by Pink Floyd?", the retrieval system might return a general overview of the band Pink Floyd (Doc 2 in Figure 1). Although such a document is related to the band and its music, it does not explicitly mention the album containing the song "Time", thereby failing to address the core question. 3.2.2 Irrelevant Documents. Irrelevant documents are those that bear no connection to the query topic. Such documents are typically retrieved due to inaccuracies in the retrieval model’s judgment. For instance, in response to the same query, the system might retrieve a document introducing another band likeNirvana (Doc 3 in Figure 1). While about music, it has no relevance to Pink Floyd or its albums, making it a clear example of an irrelevant document. 3.2.3 Counterfactual Documents. Counterfactual documents con- sist of false or misleading information, often resulting from inaccu- racies or malicious manipulation within online content. They fail to answer the question and may even lead to misconceptions. For example, while the correct answer to the query is "The Dark Side of the Moon", a counterfactual document might falsely claim that the song "Time" appears on another album "Wish You
