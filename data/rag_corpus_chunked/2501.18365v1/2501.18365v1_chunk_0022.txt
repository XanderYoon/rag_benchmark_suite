the EM performance of each model under different retrieval defect types and various 𝜏 values. It can be observed that RbFT consistently achieves the best performance across all defect levels and retrieval defect scenarios (i.e., Noisy, Irrelevant, Counterfactual, and Mix), demonstrating outstanding robustness and broad applicability. Whether in a noise-free stan- dard environment or extreme conditions with highly noisy, irrele- vant, or misleading information, RbFT significantly outperforms Conference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY Yiteng Tu, Weihang Su, Yujia Zhou, Yiqun Liu, Qingyao Ai Table 2: Ablation study on the impact of two fine-tuning tasks, Defects Detection (referred to as DD in the table) and Utility Extraction (referred to as UE in the table). The EM metrics on the test set and the change ratios of EM between single-task fine-tuning and RbFT are reported. "*" denotes the result is significantly worse than RbFT with 𝑝 < 0.05 level.
