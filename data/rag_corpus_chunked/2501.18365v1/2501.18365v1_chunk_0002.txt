generating intermediate results, which the LLM must aggregate or evaluate to produce the final response. Second, more impor- tantly, these methods tend to fail under severe retrieval defects or other challenging conditions since they do not fundamentally address the LLM’s dependency on input knowledge. For instance, RobustRAG [53] follows an "isolate-then-aggregate" pipeline, where answers are independently generated for each retrieved document and then aggregated. This approach not only incurs high inference costs but also becomes ineffective when the proportion of negative documents is high. CRAG [54], on the other hand, leverages the large-scale web search to supplement and rely on the vanilla LLM to integrate and refine knowledge from different sources. How- ever, when the vanilla LLM fails to identify the defects in retrieved results, the whole pipeline would be broken and ineffective. Based on the identified shortcomings of the aforementioned ap- proaches, we believe that building an efficient and robust RAG system requires us to improve the inherent defensive capabilities of LLMs to fundamentally reduce their over-reliance on and blind trust in input information. Specifically, a well-defended LLM should have two characteristics: (1) Defects Detection: it should be capable of distinguishing what kind of information facilitates an effective response to the user’s query and which documents are irrelevant or even harmful; (2) Utility Extraction: it should effectively utilize the limited useful information provided by the retriever while ig- noring irrelevant or harmful content, even under adverse retrieval defects. Therefore, we propose two corresponding fine-tuning tasks arXiv:2501.18365v1 [cs.CL] 30 Jan 2025 Conference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY Yiteng Tu, Weihang Su, Yujia Zhou, Yiqun Liu, Qingyao Ai aimed at strengthening the LLM’s overall defensive capabilities: Defects Detection and Utility Extraction, collectively referred to as Robust Fine-Tuning (RbFT). Specifically, we replace the original retrieved documents with defective ones and
