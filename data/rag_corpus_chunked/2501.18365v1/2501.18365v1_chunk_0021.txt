Results in Figure 3 indi- cate that RbFT outperforms all other methods in both dimensions, achieving the best overall performance. Specifically, in terms of ef- fectiveness, RbFT surpasses the second-best method, Vanilla RAG; while in robustness, it significantly outperforms the most com- petitive method, AstuteRAG. This indicates that RbFT not only maintains high answering accuracy but also effectively defends against various complex retrieval defects, striking a better balance between effectiveness and robustness. Figure 4 further illustrates the EM performance of each model under different retrieval defect types and various 𝜏 values. It can be observed that RbFT consistently achieves the best performance across all defect levels and retrieval defect scenarios (i.e., Noisy, Irrelevant, Counterfactual, and Mix), demonstrating outstanding robustness and broad applicability.
