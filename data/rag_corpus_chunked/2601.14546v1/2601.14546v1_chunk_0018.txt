correlation of 0.3915, compared to 0.2873 for PerpAalone and 0.2952 for QPP. These improvements are consistently significant under Fisher’sz-test, indicat- ing that the model’s self-confidence, captured by PerpA, complements the pre- generation signals from the context to yield stronger predictions. Nonetheless, this benefit comes at the cost of waiting for the full answer to be generated. To conclude for RQ-4, incorporating post-generation PerpAconsistently improves RPP and GPP accuracy over pre-generation predictors. 12 Tian et al. 2 3 5 7 10 Context Size (k) 0.2 0.3 0.4Spearman's (a) RPP Accuracy 2 3 5 7 10 Context Size (k) (b) GPP Accuracy A-Pair-Ratio PreGen-Ensmbl ProbA PostGen-Ensmbl Fig.3: Prediction accuracy with varying context size from 2 to 10.

The retriever is E5 for both settings. 5.2 Prediction Accuracy for Varying Context Size (k) As the size of the RAG context (in terms of the number of documents in the context) changes, both answer quality and context utility may vary [55], which in turn affects the prediction accuracy of RPP and GPP. Figure 3 shows the results for the E5 retriever across context sizes from 2 to 10. We compare: (1) the best- performing pre-generation method (A-Pair-Ratio, see Table 1); (2) the combina- tion of all pre-generation predictors (PreGen-Ensmbl); (3) the post-generation predictor PerpA; and (4) the full combination of all pre- and post-generation predictors (PostGen-Ensmbl). At each context size, ensembles consistently outperform individual predic- tors: PreGen-Ensmbl is always more accurate than the best single pre-generation method, and PostGen-Ensmbl yields the best overall performance. This aligns with our earlier findings in RQs, where combining predictors produces more accurate predictions than using them in isolation. Overall, the accuracy of pre- generation predictors declines askgrows for both RPP and GPP, reflecting the increasing difficulty of analysing
