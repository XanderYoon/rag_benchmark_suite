Then, we discuss how prediction accuracy varies with context size in Section 5.2. 5.1 Main Observations RQ1: Usefulness of QPP approaches for RPP and GPP.Table 1 reports the results of existing QPP approaches for RPP and GPP with each column corresponding to a particular ranker. Overall, QPP estimates are positively cor- related with both context utility (RPP) and answer quality (GPP), confirming that topical relevance remains an informative signal for predicting RAG perfor- mance, consistent with prior findings [55]. From Table 1, we observe that QPP methods generally achieve higher correlations in GPP than in RPP, suggesting that answer quality is easier to approximate than predicting utility because it likely depends not only on the retrieved context’s relevance but also on how that information interacts with the LLM’s inherent knowledge [41]. The most effec- tive QPP predictor varies with the retriever model used – consistent with earlier findings that QPP accuracy is ranker-dependent [23]. For BM25 and MonoT5, DenseQPP leads to the best GPP results indicating that the density of the doc- ument embeddings is a useful indicator of the answer quality. However, the ef- fective performance of MaxScore with MonoT5 and
