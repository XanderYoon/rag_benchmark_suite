Section 3.2, we use context perplexity (PerpC) and answer perplexity (PerpA) as reader-centric predictors. Both predictors are derived from the model’s next-token probabilities provided by Llama-3-8B. In our experiments, PerpCserves as a pre-generation predictor, while PerpAis used as an additional post-generation predictor for both RPP and GPP. For implementation, we compute PerpAand PerpCas the exponentials of theaveragelog-probabilities(withoutnegation),sothathighervaluescorrespond positively with answer quality and context utility. Document Quality Measures.To capture both document- and context-level signals,wecomputethemaximum,minimum,andaveragescoreacrossindividual documents, as well as a direct score for the concatenated context, using the following document readability and quality measures: – TraditionalReadabilityMetrics,includingDale-Chall[15]andSpache[53], which rely on word familiarity and lexical difficulty; Flesch–Kincaid [27] and GunningFog[26],whichanalysesentencestructurecomplexity;Coleman–Liau[10], which uses character-based counts as proxies for reading effort. – QualT5[8]: a supervised T5-based model trained to estimate document qual- ity in a query-agnostic manner, designed to assess the intrinsic usefulness of documents for downstream retrieval tasks. We use linear regression (Equation (2)) to combine 2 or more predictors, trained on the NQ dev set (8757 queries), using context utility (U) and answer quality (P) as targets for RPP or GPP, respectively. 10 Tian et al. Table 2: Prediction accuracy of combining various predictor groups using linear regres- sion, fork= 2retrieved documents. The best scores for the PreGen and the PostGen settings are bold-faced separately. A “†” indicates statistical significance (Fisher’sz, 95% confidence) of a PreGen predictor over a QPP-only setting, whereas a “‡” indicates statistical significance of a PostGen predictor over a PreGen setting.
