con- figuration. A good GPP model can therefore indicate how reliable the produced answer will be, taking into account both the retrieved context and the LLM’s inherent knowledge. Formally, the target of GPP is the answer qualityP(ak), computed against ground truth answers. A GPP predictor is defined asϕGP P :q, a k 7→R, where the output is an estimate of the answer quality. An accurate GPP model should 6 Tian et al. assign higher scores to answers that better satisfy the information need of the input query. Equivalently, when ranking a set of generated answers, the GPP- induced ranking should be positively correlated with the ground-truth ranking by answer quality. Similar to RPP, GPP can draw on multiple signals from both the retrieved context and the generated output, which we introduce next in Section 3.2. 3.2 Information Sources for RPP and GPP Accurate predictions for a RAG system require analyses from multiple perspec- tives. Each analysis yields features related to retrieval utility and answer quality, which can be formulated as a predictorϕ. We group these predictors into three categories: (i) predicted relevance of the context, (ii) perplexity of the context or the generated answer, and (iii) intrinsic quality of the documents. Context Relevance Predictors.The first category of predictors predicts the relevance of the retrieved context, adapted from existing query performance prediction (QPP) approaches. Since the goal of a retriever is to return relevant documents, QPP methods analyse retrieval results from the retriever’s perspec- tive, and we therefore describe these asretriever-centric. These predictors rely on signals available directly from the retrieval process, such as retrieval scores, dense embeddings, and document texts. QPP encompasses a diverse set of methods, each targeting a different aspect of retrieval quality. Some estimate the upper bound of list relevance [56], while others examine the distribution of
