RAG is helpful, we would expect the generated answera k to be enhanced compared to the zero-shot answera0. Indeed, [55] definedcontext utilityas the actual influence of retrieved documents on downstream answer quality. Specifically, similar to [55], we define the utility Uof the top-kretrieved documents (when used as RAG context) as: U(θ R(q)k) =P(θ G(q;θ R(q)k))−P(θ G(q;∅)),(1) wherePis a task-specific performance measure (e.g., F1 score for QA on NQ [9]). Retrieval Performance Prediction (RPP).The first prediction module in our RAG workflow, RPP, estimates the utility of retrieval results. The goal is to decide whether using the retrieved context is beneficial compared to zero-shot generation, without directly observing bothk-shot and zero-shot performances as in Equation (1). Different from QPP in IR, which focuses on topical relevance, RPP targets context utilityUof the top-kretrieved documentsθR(q)k, reflecting its support for LLM to answer the queryq. Formally, an RPP modelϕRP P : q, θR(q)k 7→R, where the output is an estimate of the utilityUofθ R(q)k. The prediction may be based on features of the query, the retrieved context, or (in post-generation settings) the generated answer. An accurate RPP model should assign higher predicted scores to the contexts that provide higher utility for answeringqin RAG. Generation Performance Prediction (GPP).The second prediction mod- ule, GPP, differs from RPP in its prediction target. While RPP estimates the utility of retrieved documents relative to zero-shot generation, GPP directly predicts the quality of the generator’s final output under the current RAG con- figuration. A good GPP model can therefore indicate how reliable the produced answer will be, taking into account both the retrieved context and the LLM’s inherent knowledge. Formally, the target of GPP is the answer qualityP(ak), computed against ground truth answers. A GPP predictor is defined asϕGP P :q, a k 7→R, where the output is an estimate of
