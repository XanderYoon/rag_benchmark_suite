The GFM-RAG consists of three main components: A.KG-index construction, which constructs a knowledge graph index from document corpus ( 1 ); B.graph foundation model retriever(GFM retriever), which is pre-trained on large-scale datasets and could retrieve documents based on any user query and KG-index ( 2 3 ); and C.documents ranking and answer generation, which ranks retrieved documents and generates final answer ( 4 5 ). 3.1 KG-index Construction Conventional embedding-based index methods encode documents as separate vectors [ 30, 5, 43], which are limited in
