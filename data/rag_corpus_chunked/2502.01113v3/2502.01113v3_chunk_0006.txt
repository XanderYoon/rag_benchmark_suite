on conventional graph-related tasks, and transformer-like GFMs [61, 60] struggle with large-scale graphs and capture logical association [52]. How to design a GNN-based GFM to enhance the reasoning of LLM remains an open question. 3 Approach The proposed GFM-RAG essentially implements a GraphRAG paradigm by constructing graphs from documents and using a graph-enhanced retriever to retrieve relevant documents. GFM-RAG Overview.Given a set of documents D={D 1,D 2,. . .,D |D|}, we construct a knowl- edge graph G={(e,r,e ′)∈ E × R × E} , where e,e ′ ∈ E and r∈ R denote the set of entities and relations extracted from D, respectively. For a user query q, we aim to design a graph-enhanced retriever to obtain relevant documents from D by leveraging the knowledge graph G. The whole GFM-RAGprocess can be formulated as: G=KG-index(D),(1) DK =GFM-Retriever(q,D,G),(2) a=LLM(q,D K).(3) In the first step, KG-index(·) constructs a knowledge graph index G from the document corpus D, followed by our proposedgraph foundation model retriever(GFM-Retriever), which is pre-trained on large-scale datasets. It retrieves top-K documents based on any user query q and knowledge graph index G. The retrieved documents DK, along with the query q, are then input into a large language model (LLM) to generate the final answera. These three main components in GFM-RAG are illustrated in Figure 2 and will be detailed next. 3 Graph Foundation Model for Retrieval Augmented Generation Barack Obama (born in August 4, 1961, Honolulu) is an American politician… He married to Michelle Obama.
