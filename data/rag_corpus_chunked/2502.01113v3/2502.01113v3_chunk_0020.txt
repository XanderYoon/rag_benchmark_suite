As shown in Figure 4, the performance of GFM-RAG (MRR: z) scales well with the training data (x) and the model size (y), which can be fitted by the power-law scaling law z∝0.24x 0.05 + 0.11y 0.03. The results demonstrate the scalability of GFM-RAG as the foundation model and potential for further improvement. The detailed analysis of the neural scaling law is shown in Section E.7. 4.8 Path Interpretations GFM-RAG exhibits the multi-hop reasoning ability powered by the multi-layer GFM. We provide path interpretations of GFM-RAG for multi-hop reasoning in Table 4. Inspired by NBFNet [78], the paths’ importance to the final prediction can be quantified by the partial derivative of the prediction score with respect to the triples at each layer (hop), defined as: s1,s 2,. . .,s L = argtop-k ∂pe(q) ∂sl .(19) The top-k path interpretations can be obtained by the
