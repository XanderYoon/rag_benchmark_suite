integrated documents with KGs to improve knowledge coverage and retrieval [9, 35]. A graph structure is built from these documents to aid in identifying relevant content for LLM generation [8]. Based on graphs, LightRAG [15] incorporates graph structures into text indexing and retrieval, enabling efficient retrieval of entities and their relationships. HippoRAG [ 16] enhances multi-hop retrieval by using a personalized PageRank algorithm to locate relevant knowledge with graphs. However, the graph structure can be noisy and incomplete, leading to suboptimal performance. Efforts to incorporate GNNs into graph-enhanced RAG [41, 18] have shown impressive results due to the multi-hop graph reasoning capabilities of GNNs in handling incomplete graphs [73]. Nonetheless, these methods still limit in generalizability due to the lack of a graph foundational model. Graph Foundation models (GFM)aims to be a large-scale model that can generalize to various datasets [40, 37]. The main challenge in designing GFMs is identifying graph tokens that capture invariance across diverse graph data. For instance, ULTRA [11] employs four fundamental relational interactions in knowledge graphs (KGs) to create a GFM with 0.2M parameters for link prediction. OpenGraph [68] develops a graph tokenizer that converts graphs into a unified node token representa- tion, enabling transformer-like GFMs for tasks such as link prediction and node classification. GFT [66] introduces a transferable tree vocabulary to construct a GFM that demonstrates effectiveness across various tasks and domains in graph learning. Despite these successful efforts, most methods primarily focus on conventional graph-related tasks, and transformer-like GFMs [61, 60] struggle with large-scale graphs and capture logical association [52]. How to design a GNN-based GFM to enhance the reasoning of LLM remains an open question. 3 Approach The proposed GFM-RAG essentially implements a GraphRAG paradigm by constructing graphs from documents and using a graph-enhanced retriever to retrieve relevant documents.
