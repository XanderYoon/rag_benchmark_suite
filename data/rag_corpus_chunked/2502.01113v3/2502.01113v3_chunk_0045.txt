are shown in Table 9. We can observe that GNN plays a crucial role in retrieval. The sentence embedding model all-mpnet-v2 is pre-trained on large-scale text data and could potentially see the QA data. However, it is not specifically trained for the multi-hop QA task, which leads to 3https://huggingface.co/ 21 Table 10: Effectiveness of KGC pre-training and supervised retrieval fine-tuning inGFM-RAG.

The fine-tuned all-mpnet-v2 achieves better performance than the pre-trained one by supervised fine-tuning on the multi-hop QA data, but still inferior to GFM-RAG. This indicates that the GNN can effectively capture the relationship between knowledge and conduct multi-hop reasoning, which is not achievable by simply using the sentence embedding model. E.2 Effectiveness of Different Training Strategies In this section, we first study the effectiveness of the two training tasks used inGFM-RAG. We compare the performance by only conducting the KG completion pre-training ( GFM-RAGw/o Fine-tune) and supervised document retrieval fine-tuning (GFM-RAGw/o Pre-train). The results are shown in Table 10. The results show that removing the supervised document retrieval fine-tuning significantly decreases the performance of GFM-RAG. This highlights the importance of supervised fine-tuning, as it enables the model to understand users’ queries and better capture the relevance between questions and knowledge for improved retrieval. Although the pre-training has a relatively small impact on the final performance, its primary purpose is to learn the general graph reasoning
