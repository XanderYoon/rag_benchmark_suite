the baselines are shown in the Section C. Metrics.For retrieval performance, we use recall@2 (R@2) and recall@5 (R@5) as evaluation metrics. For final QA performance, we use the EM score and F1 score following previous works [16]. Implementation Details.The GFM retriever is implemented with 6 query-dependent message passing layers with the hidden dimension set to 512. The pre-trained all-mpnet-v2 [57] is adopted as the sentence embedding model and is frozen during training. The total parameters of the GFM retriever are 8M, which is trained on 8 NVIDIA A100s (80G) with batch size 4, learning rate 5e-4, and loss weight α= 0.3 . The training data contains 60 KGs with over 14M triples constructed from 700k documents extracted from the training set. The statistics of training data are shown in Table 5, and the implementations are detailed in Section D. 4.2 Retrieval Performance We first evaluate the retrieval performance ofGFM-RAG against the baselines on three multi-hop QA datasets. As shown in Table 1, GFM-RAG achieves the best performance on all datasets, outperforming the SOTA IRCoT + HippoRAG by 16.8%, 8.3%, 19.8% in R@2 on HotpotQA, MuSiQue, and 2Wiki, respectively. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of GFM-RAG in multi-hop retrieval. From the result, we can observe that the naive single-step retrievers (e.g., BM25, RAPTOR) are outperformed by graph-enhanced HippoRAG, which highlights the significance of graph structure in multi-hop retrieval. Although GraphRAG (MS) and LightRAG use the graph structure, it struggles with multi- hop QA tasks as its retriever is designed for summarization and lacks multi-hop reasoning capability. With the help of LLMs, the multi-step retrieval pipeline IRCoT improves the performance of all single-step methods through iterative reasoning and retrieval. However,GFM-RAG still outperforms the multi-step methods by a large margin even with a single-step retrieval. This indicates that the GFM-RAG can effectively conduct
