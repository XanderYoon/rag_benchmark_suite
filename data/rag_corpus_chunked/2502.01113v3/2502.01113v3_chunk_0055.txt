OpenIE extraction. We would explore the use of efficient KG construction methods in future work and optimize the construction process. (2) The model size of the GFM-RAG is relatively small (8M) compared to other foundation models like large language models with billions of parameters. Although it is not faired to directly compare the GNN-based model with transformer-based LLMs, we would explore the scaling of GFM-RAG in future work to improve its performance and generalizability. (3) GFM-RAG is only evaluated on multi-hop QA tasks and KG completion tasks. We would explore the capabilities of GFM-RAG in other tasks such as knowledge graph question answering and knowledge graph reasoning in future work to validate its effectiveness as a foundation model. Impact Statement This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of Machine Learning. There are many potential societal consequences of our work, none which we feel must be specifically highlighted here. 27 OpenIE Prompt ## I n s t r u c t i o n : Your task is to c on st ruc t an RDF ( Resource D e s c r i p t i o n Fr am ew ork ) graph from the given passages and named entity lists .
