Meanwhile, we also integrate GFM-RAG with IRCoT to conduct multi-step retrieval and reasoning, which further improves the performance by 8.5%, 21.2%, 3.9% in EM on three datasets, respectively. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and great compatibility ofGFM-RAGwith an arbitrary multi-step framework in multi-hop reasoning tasks. 4.4 Efficiency Analysis GFM-RAG achieves great efficiency in performing multi-step reasoning in a single step. As shown in Table 3, while the naive single-step methods get the best efficiency whose performance is not satisfying. Admittedly, the multi-step framework IRCoT could improve the performance, but it suffers from high computational costs due to the iterative retrieval and reasoning with LLMs. In contrast, GFM-RAG conducts multi-hop reasoning within a single-step GNN reasoning, which is more
