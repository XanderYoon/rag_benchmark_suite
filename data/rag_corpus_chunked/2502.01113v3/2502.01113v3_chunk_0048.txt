Uses only the top-T predicted entities without applying IDF weighting (w/o eq. (15)). (4)All Pred: Use all entity predictions and directly map to document scores (w/o eqs. (14) and (15)). The results are shown in Table 13. The results show that the proposedIDF + Top-k Predperforms the best. This indicates that the inverted index is a crucial component of GFM-RAG, which serves as a bridge between structured reasoning over KGs and the unstructured documents required by LLMs, necessitating a careful design. We acknowledge the potential alternatives, and as a promising future direction, we plan to explore end-to-end models that can jointly reason over structured and unstructured knowledge without relying on an explicit inverted index.

Results are shown Table 14. These results show that GFM-RAG not only performs well on the trained datasets, but also generalizes well to other datasets. More importantly, the model trained on multi-domain datasets performs competitively across all datasets, validating its ability to generalize effectively across domains and benefit from training on diverse KGs by learning generalizable reasoning ability across domains. E.6 Model Transferability In this section, we evaluate GFM-RAG’s transferability by conducting domain-specific fine-tuning on the training split of dataset on each domain. As shown in 15, GFM-RAG performs well in zero- shot generalization, with further improvements
