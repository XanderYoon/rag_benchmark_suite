(Sections 4.2 and 4.3); (2) What are the efficiency and effectiveness of GFM-RAG in multi-hop retrieval? (Section 4.4); (3) How well does GFM-RAG generalize to unseen datasets as a foundation model? (Section 4.6); (4) How does the performance of GFM-RAG scale with training as a foundation model? (Section 4.7); (5) How to interpret GFM-RAG in multi-hop reasoning? (Section 4.8). 4.1 Experimental Setup Datasets.We first evaluate the effectiveness of GFM-RAG on three widely-used multi-hop QA datasets, including HotpotQA [72], MuSiQue [63], and 2WikiMultiHopQA (2Wiki) [20]. We also evaluate the performance of GFM-RAG on seven RAG datasets from three domains, including biomedical [25], custom support [54, 44, 39, 4], and general knowledge [45, 27], to demonstrate the generalizability of GFM-RAG as the foundation model. The detailed statistics of the test datasets are shown in the Section B. Baselines.We compare against several widely used retrieval methods under three categories: (1) single-step naive methods: BM25 [53], Contriever [22], GTR [46], ColBERTv2 [55], RAPTOR [56], Proposition [6]; (2)graph-enhanced methods: GraphRAG (MS) [9], LightRAG [15], HippoRAG [16], SubgraphRAG [32], G-retriever [18]; (3)multi-step methods: Adaptive-RAG [ 23], FLARE [24], and IRCoT [64] framework that can be integrated with arbitrary retrieval methods to conduct multi-step retrieval and reasoning. The detailed introduction of the baselines are shown in the Section C. Metrics.For retrieval performance, we use recall@2 (R@2) and recall@5 (R@5) as evaluation metrics. For final QA performance, we use the EM score and F1 score following previous works [16]. Implementation Details.The GFM retriever is implemented with 6 query-dependent message passing layers with the hidden dimension set to 512. The pre-trained all-mpnet-v2 [57]
