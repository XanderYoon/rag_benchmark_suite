potential for scaling to even larger datasets. In the future, we plan to conduct larger-scale training and further explore GFM-RAG’s capabilities in other challenging scenarios such as knowledge graph completion and question answering. 10 Acknowledgments G Haffari is partly supported by the ARC Future Fellowship FT190100039 and DARPA Assured Neuro Symbolic Learning and Reasoning (ANSR) program under award number FA8750-23-2-1016.
