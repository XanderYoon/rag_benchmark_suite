Recent studies [21, 52] have theoretically proven that query-dependent GNNs are effective for capturing the multi-hop logical associations on KGs to answer queries, such as: ∃y:politician_of(Barack Obama,y)←work_in(Barack Obama,z 1)∧city_of(z 1,y),(20) where the right part denotes the logical associations can be executed to answer the query on the left, i.e., “politician_of(Barack Obama,y)”. This query is semantic equivalent to the nature language question: “ Barack Obama is the politician of which country? ”. By treating the input question as a “soft query” (query in nature language), we apply the query-dependent GNN (GFM) to bridge the gap between nature language and logical query. The GFM tries to understand the semantic of the questions and learn to conduct complex logical reasoning (e.g., multi-hop reasoning) on KGs for retrieval [73]. The learned logical associations for reasoning are shown in Section 4.8. Table 5: Statistics of the query-doc pairs and KGs used for training.
