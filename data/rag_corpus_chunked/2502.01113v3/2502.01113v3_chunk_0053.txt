Table 19: Token cost comparison for index construction Method # Tokens per 10k documents LightRAG 55M GraphRAG 76M GFM-RAG48M E.9 Cost and Impact of LLMs on KG-index Construction In this section, we first analyze the cost of the KG-index construction. In experiments, we utilize GPT- 4o-mini4 for OpenIE extraction and construct the KG-index for 737,310 documents. The cost is shown in Tables 18 and 19. Specifically, we find that constructing the KG-index requires approximately 48M tokens per 10k documents, which costs around $2.6 using GPT-4o-mini. LightRAG and GraphRAG cost 57M tokens and 76M tokens, respectively. Compared to other methods, GFM-RAG is more cost-effective as it does not require generating community-level summaries. In addition, we compare the graph index construction time of GFM-RAG in Table 20. Results show that GFM-RAG benefits from the quick index process during retrieval, as it does not construct a traditional vector database to store documents and entities. Admittedly, using an LLM for KG index construction incurs computational costs. However, KG construction has been extensively studied, and numerous alternative methods exist that do not rely on LLMs [76]. Our implementation offers an easy interface for integration with any KG construction tools. We would explore the use of other KG construction methods in future work. We further analyze the impact of LLMs used for KG-index construction on the performance of GFM-RAG. We conduct experiments using different LLMs for KG-index construction, including GPT-4o-mini and GPT-3.5-turbo5. Then, we reevaluate the performance of GFM-RAG and HippoRAG with the constructed KG-index. The results are shown in Table 21. From the results, the performance of both methods on the KG extracted by GPT-4o-mini is higher than the ones by GPT-3.5-turbo. This supports the opinion
