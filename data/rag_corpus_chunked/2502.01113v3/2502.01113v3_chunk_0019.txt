E.9). The results show that GFM-RAG is not sensitive to different sentence embedding models, and the pre-training strategy, as well as the loss weighting strategy, are both crucial for the performance ofGFM-RAG. 4.6 Model Generalizability To demonstrate the generalizability of GFM-RAG as a foundation model, we test the performance (R@5) of GFM-RAG on seven RAG datasets without any domain-specific fine-tuning. Specifically, we first build the KG-index from the documents in each dataset. Then, given the query, we use the pre- trained GFM retriever to retrieve the top-K documents with the help of the corresponding KG-index. As shown in Figure 3, GFM-RAG achieves the best performance on all datasets, outperforming the SOTA HippoRAG by 18.9% on average. The results demonstrate the generalizability of GFM-RAG as the foundation model which can be directly applied to various unseen datasets without any domain- specific fine-tuning. Additionally, results in Section E.6 demonstrateGFM-RAG’s strong transferability for further performance improvement when fine-tuned on domain-specific datasets. 4.7 Model Neural Scaling Law We further investigate the neural scaling law ofGFM-RAG, which quantifies how model performance grows with the scale of training data and model parameter size. It has been validated in the recent 9 Table 4: Path interpretations of GFM for multi-hop reasoning, where r−1 denotes the inverse of original relation.
