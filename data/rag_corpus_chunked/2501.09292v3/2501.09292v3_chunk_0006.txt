(NLI) classiﬁer. Here, the number of semantic sets can be reg arded as an uncertainty esti- mate as when the responses differ in meaning, the number of gr oups increases. • Eigen V alue Laplacian: deﬁnes the uncertainty estimate by capturing the essence o f spec- tral clustering. First, an adjacency matrix is created from the pairwise similarities of re- sponses. Then the matrix is partitioned into clusters, wher e each cluster corresponds to a distinct “meaning” or category within the responses. The ei genvalues close to one indicate strong cluster formations, thus contributing less to the un certainty estimate, while those fur- ther from one suggest weaker clustering or more diffuse dist ributions of responses, hence increasing the uncertainty estimate. The degree matrix of the adjacency graph is also used to compu te the uncertainty esti- mate Lin et al. (2023). A node that is well-connected to other nodes, might be less uncer- tain. We use two similarity metrics for computing the degree matrix. • Degree Matrix (Jaccard Index) : The Jaccard similarity is a light-weight metric where sentences or passages are treated as sets of words, and simil arity between responses is computed by taking the fraction of the intersection of the tw o sets and the union of the two sets. • Degree Matrix (NLI) : Here, the similarity between responses is computed throug h classi- fying entailment relations amongst them. A classiﬁer predi cts whether a pair of responses contradict, entail, or are neutral to each other. 3 1st workshop of “Quantify Uncertainty and Hallucination in Foundation Models: The Next Frontier in Reliable AI” at ICLR’25 Uncertainty Estimator Trigger Retrieval When Retrieval Query #examples #search #steps f1 Always Retrieve U ≥ 0 Temporary Sentence 25 4.60 3.60 0.552 Always Retrieve Sub-Query 25 5.00 4.00 0.538 FLARE-Instruct
