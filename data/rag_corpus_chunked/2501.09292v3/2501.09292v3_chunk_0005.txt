generation, we evaluate the uncertainty of this temp orary sentence tn to gauge if the gen- erator needs more information. If the uncertainty U(tn) exceeds a threshold θU, the model is not certain and may lack the necessary knowledge to provide an ac curate answer. The next sentence yi is then computed by appending retrieved information to the m odel context: yi = {G(P{d1, . . . , dk, q, . . . , yi−1}) if U(ti) > θ U G(P{q, . . . , yi−1}) otherwise (2) where d1 . . . dk are obtained from a retrieval system R. d1 . . . dk := R(q) (3) 4.2 S EQUENCE LEVEL UNCERTAINTY EVALUATION MEASURES We resort to 5 recently introduced sequence-level uncertai nty evaluation measures. Each of them work in a black box manner without requiring information reg arding the model parameters. The high-level strategy of all the methods is the same. Given an input x, ﬁrst generate n responses through some generator G and then compute pairwise similarity scores of each of the n responses with each other. Using these similarity values, compute an uncertainty estimate U (x) or a conﬁdence score. • Semantic Sets : In the black-box approach of Kuhn et al. (2023), the authors propose to compute semantic sets i.e. groups of responses that are clos e together in meaning. These semantic sets of equivalence subsets are computed using a Na tural Language Inference (NLI) classiﬁer. Here, the number of semantic sets can be reg arded as an uncertainty esti- mate as when the responses differ in meaning, the number of gr oups increases. • Eigen V alue Laplacian: deﬁnes the uncertainty estimate by capturing the essence o f spec- tral clustering. First, an adjacency matrix is created from the pairwise similarities of re-
