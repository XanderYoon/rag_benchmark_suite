tools predominantly focus on algorithmic and systemic bias, with a lack of AI literacy interventions that address human biases (See Table 2). Further, existing tools are target domain-specific use cases or users with technical expertise, creating accessibility barriers that widen the digital divide and leave broader populations without effective means to develop critical AI competencies [1]. 2.2 Theoretical gap: the role of metacognition in human-AI interaction Further, there is a gap in competency dimensions that current AI literacy is advocating for: the current emphasis on technical competencies in human intervention, such as prompt engineering, and ethical and responsible AI use, which is essential for human-AI collaboration beyond automation [14, 28]. Bridging this gap in AI literacy frameworks requires AI literacy to move beyond first-level (operational understanding) to incorporate metacognitive skills by providing enhanced explainability and customizability in tool design and educational contents to support metacognitive demands in human-AI interaction [51, 53]. However, their effectiveness depends on understanding the individual factors that shape how students engage with AI. While UNESCO competency frameworks for AI literacy capture various learning dimensions [55], mitigation of biases requires not only knowledge-based analytics but also attributional and affective dimensions involving individual factors, including the confidence [48], trust [29], agency [11], and anthropomorphism tendency [48], which needs to be further addressed to better support diverse learners [16]. 3 Conceptual Framework: towards learner-centered AIED To address identified technical and theoretical gaps, design solutions with a deliberate friction approach and a new theoretical framework for bi-directional intervention will be discussed as key foundations for the development of DeBiasMe. 3.1 Deliberate friction in human-AI feedback loops While the design of AI as an automatic decision-making system tends to reduce cognitive load for users and minimize interruptions in user workflows [35], design interventions known as "deliberate friction" can introduce intentional pauses
