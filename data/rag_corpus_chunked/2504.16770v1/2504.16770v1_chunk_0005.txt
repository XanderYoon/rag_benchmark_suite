and a new theoretical framework for bi-directional intervention will be discussed as key foundations for the development of DeBiasMe. 3.1 Deliberate friction in human-AI feedback loops While the design of AI as an automatic decision-making system tends to reduce cognitive load for users and minimize interruptions in user workflows [35], design interventions known as "deliberate friction" can introduce intentional pauses and reflection opportunities [7]. This reflective and value-sensitive approach facilitates active control and independent Manuscript submitted to ACM 4 Chaeyeon Lim Table 2.

These friction points serve as metacognitive triggers and knowledge scaffolding, reducing susceptibility to and amplification between cognitive and AI biases. 3.2 Bi-Directional human-AI collaboration Such design intervention can be effectively intergrated when
