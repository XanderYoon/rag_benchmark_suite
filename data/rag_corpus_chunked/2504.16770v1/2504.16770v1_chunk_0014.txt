AI assistance is necessary for a given task, encouraging a more reflective approach to AI use. This paradigm shifts away from treating AI as an automatic solution to problems, instead positioning it as a strategic cognitive aid that should be deployed selectively and intentionally. This approach fosters adaptive, empathetic leadership in an era of AI sovereignty, where educational institutions and individuals maintain meaningful control over their AI infrastructure, data governance, and decision-making processes [4, 33]. 6.0.3 Educational and Social Implications. This approach will benefit multiple stakeholders in the educational ecosystem: At the institutional level, tools like DeBiasMe can serve as bridges between academic integrity policies and students’ everyday AI interactions, providing structured support for critical engagement while acknowledging AI’s growing role in academic work [19]. At the societal level, the tool can help address the digital confidence divide by actively involving end-users in the research, design, and dissemination of AI literacy tools [10]. Enhanced transparency regarding both human and AI biases can reshape the user-data-algorithm lifecycle in AIED by making decision processes more visible, empowering user agency. This can further inspire policy recommendations with frictional design, introducing pauses in AIED products. 7 Conclusion AI literacy tools must evolve beyond technical competencies to incorporate metacognitive skills that address human biases in human-AI collaboration. This position paper advocates for bias-aware AI literacy tools that encourage students to critically evaluate AI-generated content rather than defaulting to AI as an automatic authority. The illustrative tool DeBiasMe demonstrates AI literacy frameworks in promoting critical thinking in educational contexts by prioritizing: (1) deliberate friction to enhance metacognition, (2) bi-directional Human-AI interaction intervention, and (3) supporting diverse user engagement patterns to help students navigate the complex interactions between human and AI biases, offering a promising direction for future research and development to augment learning with learner-centered AIED.
