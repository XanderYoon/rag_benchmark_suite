tool DeBiasMe demonstrates AI literacy frameworks in promoting critical thinking in educational contexts by prioritizing: (1) deliberate friction to enhance metacognition, (2) bi-directional Human-AI interaction intervention, and (3) supporting diverse user engagement patterns to help students navigate the complex interactions between human and AI biases, offering a promising direction for future research and development to augment learning with learner-centered AIED. Acknowledgments I would like to thank Manni Cheung for his valuable early input and ongoing prototype development, UCL Interaction Centre, all participants, and Matthew Haye for their insights.
