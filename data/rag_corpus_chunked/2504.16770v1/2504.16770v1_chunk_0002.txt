For example, automation bias can make students overly reliant on AI outputs [32], confirmation bias reinforces their existing beliefs [44], and anchoring bias locks them into initial AI-generated suggestions [41]. Critically, these human biases interact with algorithmic and systemic biases embedded in AI systems and datasets [45]. This interaction creates a harmful feedback loop that can amplify both types of biases: human biases influencing how users interact with AI systems, and AI biases potentially reinforcing human cognitive biases, negatively impacting the quality of learning and critical thinking [24] (See Fig. 4). Fig. 1. Interacting categories of bias in human-AI Interaction To bring this discussion into focus, this position paper argues that AI literacy approaches should prioritize developing human bias awareness and metacognitive skills, the ability to monitor, evaluate, and regulate one’s own learning and decision-making processes when interacting with AI tools [51]. By fostering critical engagement and reflection, such tools can transform students from passive AI consumers to active collaborators with AI systems [30]. To illustrate these arguments, this paper presents work-in-progress project DeBiasMe, a metacognitive AIED (AI in Education) literacy intervention for human and AI bias mitigation. This will be extended by discussing ongoing research and
