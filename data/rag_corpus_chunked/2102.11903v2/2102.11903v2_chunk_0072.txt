of such a system is a neural ranking model, and in this survey, we have presented several such models. We began by introducing deep learning terminologies and techniques in Sect. 2 in order to cover the major components that are used in different neural ranking models. Then, We present the document retrieval field in Sect. 3. The objective of the document ranking and retrieval is to retrieve a set of documents where the top ranked documents are more relevant to the user’s query. After formulating the document ranking task using the LTR framework in Sect. 4, we reviewed the three learning to rank approaches used in ad-hoc retrieval in Sect. 5 namely, pointwise, pairwise, and listwise approaches. We summarized several tech- niques from each to address the advantages and drawbacks of each approach. In Sect. 6, we summarized the neural ranking models in ad-hoc retrieval, and we proposed placing the neural ranking models into five groups, where each group has unique neural compo- nents and architectures. In Sect. 7, we discussed the features of neural ranking models. In particular, we proposed nine features that are frequently presented in neural ranking models. These features are used for an in-depth overview of several neural ranking mod- els that are proposed in the literature. This overview gives a global view for the current state of neural ranking models in addition to the work that has been done during the last several years. In Sect. 8, we showed that neural ranking models can generalize beyond the document retrieval. In particular, we described four related retrieval tasks: struc- tured document retrieval, question-answering, image retrieval, and ad-hoc video search. Finally, in Sect. 9, we discussed the important signals in neural ranking models which are the semantic and relevance matching. In addition, we focused on a research
