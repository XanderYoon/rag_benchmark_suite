can have different lengths, and vary from short text, passage, paragraph or docu- ment. QA also includes choosing between multiple choices, and synthesizing answers from multiple resources in case the question looks for multiple pieces of information. The QA problem presents multiple challenges. The question is expressed in natural lan- guage, and the objective is to search for short answers in a document. So only the parts that are relevant to the question should be extracted. The second challenge is the differ - ent vocabulary used in questions and answers. So, a QA model needs to capture matching signals based on the intents of the question in order to extract an accurate answer. The third challenge is to gather responses from multiple sources to compose an answer. As in document retrieval, multiple neural ranking models are proposed to retrieve answers that are relevant to a given user’s question (Guo et al., 2019; Abbasiyantaeb & Momtazi, 2020; Huang et al., 2020). The neural ranking models for QA cover all five proposed categories for document retrieval with a focus on the semantic matching signal between questions and answers. 8.3 Image retrieval Image retrieval (Zhou et al., 2017) is the task of retrieving images that are relevant to a user’s query. Image retrieval has been studied from two directions: text-based and content- based methods. Text-based image retrieval uses annotations, such as the metadata, descrip- tions and keywords, that are manually added to the image to retrieve images that are rel- evant to a keyword-based query. The objective of the annotations is to describe the content of the image so that a large collection of images can be organized and indexed for retrieval. Text-based image retrieval is treated as a text-based information retrieval. With the large increase of image datasets and repositories, describing each
