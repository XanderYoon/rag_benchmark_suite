timestamp, and the hidden state that corresponds to the last timestamp in the sequence captures the context-aware representation of the entire sequence. Two major problems of the vanilla RNN are the vanishing and exploding gradients (Pascanu et al., 2013; Sutskever et al., 2011) that can occur after back-propagation through time during the training phase. For example, for long sequences, when the gradient flows from later to earlier timestamps in the input sequence, the signal from the gradient can become very weak or vanish. Two variants of RNN which are LSTM and GRU have been proposed to capture long-term dependencies better than RNN, and therefore reduce the vanishing and exploding of the Information Retrieval Journal 1 3 gradient. The new structures of LSTM and GRU allow the network to capture long- range dependencies. 2.3 Long short‑term memory (LSTM) Exploding and vanishing gradients during the training phase result in the failure of the network to learn long-term dependencies in the input data. LSTM (Hochreiter & Schmid- huber, 1997) was introduced to mitigate the effects of exploding and vanishing gradients. LSTM differs from the vanilla RNN in the structure of the memory cell where three gates are introduced to control the information in the memory cell. First, the input gate controls the influence of the current input on the memory cell. Second, the forget gate controls the previous information that should be forgotten in the current timestamp. Third, the output gate controls the influence of the memory cell on the hidden state of the current timestamp. Compared to RNN, LSTM has led to significant improvements in multiple fields with sequential data such as text, video, and speech. LSTM has been applied to solve multiple tasks including language modeling (Kim et al., 2016), text classification (Dai & Le, 2015), machine translation (Sutskever et al.,
