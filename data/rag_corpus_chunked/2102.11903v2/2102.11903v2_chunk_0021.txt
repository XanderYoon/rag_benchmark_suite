query-document pairs. The main objective of this article is to discuss the deep neural architectures that are proposed for the document retrieval task. To describe the overall steps of training neural ranking models, in the next section, we give a brief overview about the different learning strategies before presenting the existing neural ranking models. 5 Categories of strategies for learning for ad‑hoc retrieval Liu (2009) divided LTR approaches into three categories based on their training objectives. In the pointwise category, each query-document pair is associated with a real-valued rele- vance score, and the objective of the training is to make a prediction of the exact relevance score using existing classification (Gey, 1994; Li et al., 2007) or regression models (Cos- sock & Zhang, 2006; Fuhr, 1989). However, predicting the exact relevance score may not be necessary because the final objective is to produce a ranked list of documents. In the pairwise category, the ranking model does not try to accurately predict the exact real-valued relevance score of a query-document pair; instead, the objective of the training is to focus on the relative order between two documents for a given query. So, by training using the pairwise category, the ranking model tries to produce a ranked list of documents. In the pairwise approach, ranking is reduced to a binary classification to predict which of two documents is more relevant to a given query. Many pairwise approaches are proposed in the literature including methods that are based on support vector machines (Herbrich et al., 2000; Joachims, 2002), neural networks (Burges et al., 2005), Boosting (Freund et al., 1998), and other machine learning algorithms (Zheng et al., 2007, 2008). For a given query, the number of pairs is quadratic, which means that if there is an imbalance in the relevance judgments where more
