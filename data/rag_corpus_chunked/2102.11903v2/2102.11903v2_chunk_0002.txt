as an input and learn suitable representations for inputs and ranking functions. A key feature in information retrieval models is the relevance judgement. A ranking model with sufficient capacity is needed to capture the matching signals, and map doc- ument-query pairs to accurate prediction of a real-valued relevance score. Deep neural networks are known for their ability to capture complex patterns in both feature extrac- tion and model building phases. Due to the advantages of deep neural networks, research- ers have focused on designing neural ranking models to learn both features and model simultaneously. Neural ranking models have many challenges to address in information retrieval tasks. First, the queries and documents have different lengths: the query is usually a short text that typically consists of a few keywords, and the document is long with both relevant and irrelevant parts to the query. Second, in many cases, the query and documents have differ - ent terms, so exact matching models cannot be used to accurately rank documents; a neural matching model should be designed to capture semantic matching signals to predict the relevance score. The semantic similarity is context dependent, and another challenge for the neural ranking model is to understand the context of both query and documents in order to generalize across multiple domains. Many neural ranking models have been proposed primarily to solve information retrieval tasks. Other neural models are proposed for text matching tasks, and they are used in ad-hoc retrieval because understanding the semantic similarity between sentences in text matching can enhance retrieval results mainly for sentence or passage level document retrieval scenarios. So, in addition to the neural ranking models that are introduced spe- cifically for retrieval tasks, we will review multiple text matching-based neural models that can be applied to document retrieval.
