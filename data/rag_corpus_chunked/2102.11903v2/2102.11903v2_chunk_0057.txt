et al. (2020) include the exact matching of query tokens into the ranking model which leads to an overall asymmetric architecture. In the case of short documents where BERT can accept the full document and only the BERT- based model is used for ranking, the ranking model is symmetric. 8 Beyond document retrieval The idea of using neural ranking models to rank documents given a user’s query can gen- eralize to other retrieval tasks, with different objects to query and rank. In this section, we discuss the analogy between other forms of retrieval tasks and document retrieval. In par - ticular, we describe four retrieval tasks which are: structured document retrieval, Question- Answering, image retrieval, and Ad-hoc video search. Information Retrieval Journal 1 3 8.1 Structured document retrieval The information retrieval field has presented multiple methods to incorporate the internal organization of a given document into indexing and retrieval steps. The pro- gress in document design and storage has resulted in new representations for docu- ments, known as structured documents (Chiaramella, 2000), such as HTML and XML, where the document has multiple fields. Considering the structure of a document when designing retrieval models can usually improve retrieval results (Wilkinson, 1994). Zamani et al, (2018) proposed a neural ranking model that extracts the document rep- resentation from the aggregation of field-level representations and then uses a match- ing network to predict the final relevance score. Beyond Web pages, a table itself can also be considered as a structured document. Zhang & Balog, (2018) propose a semantic matching method for table retrieval where various embedding features are used. Chen et al. (2020a) first learn the embedding rep- resentations of table headers and generate new headers with embedding features and curated features (Chen et al., 2018) for data tables. They show that the
