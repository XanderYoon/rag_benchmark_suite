content types and tasks. In this survey, we focus on the document retrieval and ranking task and propose detailed descriptions and groupings of multiple neural ranking models in the document retrieval. In terms of scope, we focus on text-based document retrieval, where the input to the neural ranking model is raw text, and the output is a ranked list of documents. There are two advantages from retrieving documents using text-based neural ranking models. First, the textual input form for the query and document can be used directly by the neural ranking model, so that text-based ranking models generalize better than traditional hand- crafted models which need specific features. Second, text-based ranking models provide additional signals such as semantic and relevance matching signals to accurately predict the relevance score. Ranking and retrieving documents that are relevant to a user’s query is a classic infor - mation retrieval task. Given a query, the ranking model outputs a ranked list of documents so that the top ranked items should be more relevant to the user’s query. Search engines are examples of systems that implement ad-hoc retrieval where the possible number of queries that are continually submitted to the system is huge. The general flowchart of document retrieval with neural ranking models is illustrated in Fig. 1. A large collection of docu- ments is indexed for a fast retrieval. A user enters a text-based query which goes through a query processing step consisting of a query reformulation and expansion (Azad & Deepak, 2019).
