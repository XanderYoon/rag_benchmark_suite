including methods that are based on support vector machines (Herbrich et al., 2000; Joachims, 2002), neural networks (Burges et al., 2005), Boosting (Freund et al., 1998), and other machine learning algorithms (Zheng et al., 2007, 2008). For a given query, the number of pairs is quadratic, which means that if there is an imbalance in the relevance judgments where more groundtruth relevance scores are available for a particular query, this imbalance will be magnified by the pairwise approach. In addition, the pairwise method is more sensitive to noise than the pointwise method because a noisy relevance score for a single query-document pair leads to multiple mislabeled document pairs. The third learning category for ad-hoc retrieval is known as the listwise category, proposed by Cao et al. (2007). In the listwise category, the input to the ranking model (2)zi j = fw(qi, di j )=M ◦F(qi, di j ) Information Retrieval Journal 1 3 is the entire set of documents that are associated with a given query in the training data. Listwise approaches can be divided into two types. In the first, the loss function is directly related to evaluation measures (Chakrabarti et al., 2008; Chapelle & Wu, 2009; Qin et al., 2009). So, they directly optimize for a ranking metric such as NDCG, which is more challenging because these metrics are often not differentiable with respect to the model parameters. Therefore, these metrics are relaxed by approximation to make computation efficient. For the second type, the loss function is differentiable, but it is not directly related to the evaluation measures (Cao et al., 2007; Huang & Frey, 2008; Volkovs & Zemel, 2009). For example, in ListNet (Cao et al., 2007), the probability dis- tribution of permutations is used to define the loss function. Since a ranking list can be seen
