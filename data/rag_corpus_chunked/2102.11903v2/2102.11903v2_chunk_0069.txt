the study of selection tech- niques for sentences or passages with a trade-off between high retrieval results and low computation time. Ranking documents of length m using Transformers, which are the main components of BERT, requires O(m2) memory and time complexity (Kitaev et al., Information Retrieval Journal 1 3 2020). In particular, for very long documents, applying self-attention of Transformers is not feasible. So, BERT-based ranking models have a large increase in computational cost and memory complexity over the existing traditional and neural ranking models. A current research direction is the design of efficient and effective deep language model- based ranking architectures. For example, Khattab and Zaharia (2020) presented a rank - ing model that is based on contextualized late interaction over BERT (ColBERT). The proposed model reduces computation time by extracting BERT-based document repre- sentations offline, and delays the interaction between query and document representa- tions. RepBERT (Zhan et al., 2020b) and RocketQA (Qu et al., 2021) are other models proposed to solve the passage retrieval task following the same direction of designing a representation-based model with BERT being the main component to map the query and document. As in ColBERT, the objective is to overcome the computation time and memory limitations of the cross-encoding attentions related to the sentence pair setting of BERT. Despite the promising results of the BERT variants (ColBERT, RepBERT, RocketQA), reducing the memory complexity is still an open research question for mul- tiple reasons. First, the document embeddings need to be loaded into the system or GPU memory (Johnson et al., 2021) with a limited size to compute the relevance scores of query-document pairs. Second, the dimension of the embedding is very large compared to the bag-of-word index (Zhan et al., 2021a; Xiong et al., 2021). Therefore, vector compression methods (Jégou et al., 2011;
