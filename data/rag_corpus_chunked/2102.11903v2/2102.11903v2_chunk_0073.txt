Sect. 8, we showed that neural ranking models can generalize beyond the document retrieval. In particular, we described four related retrieval tasks: struc- tured document retrieval, question-answering, image retrieval, and ad-hoc video search. Finally, in Sect. 9, we discussed the important signals in neural ranking models which are the semantic and relevance matching. In addition, we focused on a research direc- tion that studies the trade-off between high quality retrieval results and fast computation mainly for ranking models with deep contextualized language models. By grouping the neural ranking models, we analyzed the main features of each proposed model, and pointed to future research directions based on the important signals of the ad- hoc retrieval. In particular, we reviewed the design principles of neural ranking models that are used to extract the representation of a given query-document pair. The number of proposed neural ranking architectures is increasing, and this survey can help researchers by providing an overview about the current progress, and suggesting some potential direc- tions to improve neural ranking models for document retrieval in both retrieval results and computation time.
