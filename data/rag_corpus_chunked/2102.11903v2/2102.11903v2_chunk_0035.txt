al., 2017) archi- tecture considers two information retrieval principles. The first principle is query term importance: a user expresses his request via query terms and some terms are more important than others (Fang et al., 2004). The second principle is the diverse matching requirement of query-centric contexts, which indicates that the distribution of matching Retrieval score Document ( tokens) Query ( tokens) Interac/g415on model Representa/g415on model Fig. 4 Overview of the framework of Representation+Interaction model for DUET. An interaction model and a representation model are used to compute the interaction and representation scores, respectively for a query-document pair. The final score under the DUET is the sum of scores from the interaction and repre- sentation models Information Retrieval Journal 1 3 signals can be different in a collection of relevant documents. In this context, there are two hypotheses as described by Robertson et al. (1993). The first hypothesis is known as the scope hypothesis which contains long documents with several short and unre- lated documents concatenated together. The second hypothesis is known as the verbos- ity hypothesis, where each document covers a similar topic, but it uses more words to describe the given topic. From the neural architecture perspective, the relevance match- ing of the verbosity hypothesis category is global because the document contains a sin- gle topic. On the contrary, the relevance matching of scope hypothesis can be located at any part of the document, and it only requires a passage of a document to be rel- evant to a query. A neural architecture should be able to capture local matching patterns. Also, a neural ranking model should incorporate query context into the ranking model in order to solve the ambiguity problem. For example, the query “river bank” should have a lower relevance score with a sentence or passage
