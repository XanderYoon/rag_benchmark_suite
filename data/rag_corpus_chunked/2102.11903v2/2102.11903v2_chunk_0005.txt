of models in the literature based on several features that are frequently presented in neural ranking models. The detailed comparison of multiple neural ranking models can help researchers to identify the common neural components that are used in the document retrieval task, understand the main benefits from using a given neural component, and investigate the promising neural components in future research to improve document retrieval results. In summary, the content of this survey paper is organized as follows: – In Sect. 2, we briefly introduce the deep learning terminologies and techniques to which we refer when discussing the different neural ranking models in the literature. – In Sect. 3, we introduce the document retrieval task, and present the flowchart of the neural ranking based models for document retrieval. – In Sect. 4, we formulate the document retrieval task using the LTR framework. – In Sect. 5, we review the three LTR approaches used in ad-hoc retrieval namely, pointwise, pairwise, and listwise approaches. – In Sect. 6, we summarize the neural ranking models in ad-hoc retrieval, and we propose placing the neural ranking models into five groups, where each group has unique neural components and architectures. – In Sect. 7, we discuss the features of neural ranking models, and propose nine features that are frequently presented in neural ranking models. These features are used for an in-depth overview of several neural ranking models that are proposed in the literature. – In Sect. 8, we show that neural ranking models can generalize beyond document retrieval. In particular, we describe four related retrieval tasks: structured document retrieval, ques- tion-answering, image retrieval, and ad-hoc video search. – In Sect. 9, we summarize the current best practices for the design of neural ranking mod- els, and we discuss multiple research directions in document retrieval.
