dynamic workflows and address complex problem-solving scenarios. The convergence of RAG and agentic intelligence has given rise to Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG) [14], a paradigm that integrates agents into the RAG pipeline. Agentic RAG enables dynamic retrieval strategies, contextual understanding, and iterative refinement [ 15], allowing for adaptive and efficient information processing. Unlike traditional RAG, Agentic RAG employs autonomous agents to orchestrate retrieval, filter relevant information, and refine responses, excelling in scenarios requiring precision and adaptability. The overview of Agentic RAG is in figure 1. This survey explores the foundational principles, taxonomy, and applications of Agentic RAG. It provides a comprehen- sive overview of RAG paradigms, such as Naïve RAG, Modular RAG, and Graph RAG [16], alongside their evolution into Agentic RAG systems. Key contributions include a detailed taxonomy of Agentic RAG frameworks, applications across domains such as healthcare [17, 18], finance, and education [19], and insights into implementation strategies, benchmarks, and ethical considerations. The structure of this paper is as follows: Section 2 introduces RAG and its evolution, highlighting the limitations of traditional approaches. Section 3 elaborates on the principles of agentic intelligence and agentic patterns. Section 4 elaborates agentic workflow patterns. Section 5 provides a taxonomy of Agentic RAG systems, including single-agent, multi-agent, and graph-based frameworks. Section 6 provides comparative analysis of Agentic RAG frameworks. Section 7 examines applications of Agentic RAG, while Section 8 discusses implementation tools and frameworks. Section 9 focuses on benchmarks and dataset, and Section 10 concludes with future directions for Agentic RAG systems. 2 Foundations of Retrieval-Augmented Generation 2.1 Overview of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) represents a significant advancement in the field of artificial intelligence, combining the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with real-time data retrieval. While LLMs have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing, their reliance
