integrating insights from multiple sources into a coherent and contextually relevant response. 4. Output Generation: Finally, the system delivers a comprehensive, user-facing answer that addresses the original query. This response is presented in an actionable, concise format and may optionally include references or citations to the sources used. Figure 16: An Overview of Single Agentic RAG Key Features and Advantages. • Centralized Simplicity: A single agent handles all retrieval and routing tasks, making the architecture straightforward to design, implement, and maintain. • Efficiency & Resource Optimization: With fewer agents and simpler coordination, the system demands fewer computational resources and can handle queries more quickly. • Dynamic Routing: The agent evaluates each query in real-time, selecting the most appropriate knowledge source (e.g., structured DB, semantic search, web search). • Versatility Across Tools:Supports a variety of data sources and external APIs, enabling both structured and unstructured workflows. • Ideal for Simpler Systems: Suited for applications with well-defined tasks or limited integration requirements (e.g., document retrieval, SQL-based workflows). 15 Use Case: Customer Support Prompt: Can you tell me the delivery status of my order? System Process (Single-Agent Workflow): 1. Query Submission and Evaluation: • The user submits the query, which is received by the coordinating agent. • The coordinating agent analyzes the query and determines the most appropriate sources of information. 2. Knowledge Source Selection: • Retrieves tracking details from the order management database. • Fetches real-time updates from the shipping provider’s API. • Optionally conducts a web search to identify local conditions affecting delivery, such as weather or logistical delays. 3. Data Integration and LLM Synthesis: • The relevant data is passed to the LLM, which synthesizes the information into a coherent response. 4. Output Generation: • The system generates an actionable and concise response, providing live tracking updates and potential alternatives.
