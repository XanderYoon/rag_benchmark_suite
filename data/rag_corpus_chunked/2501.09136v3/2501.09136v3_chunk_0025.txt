Idea of Corrective RAG: The core principle of Corrective RAG lies in its ability to evaluate retrieved documents dynamically, perform corrective actions, and refine queries to enhance the quality of generated responses. Corrective RAG adjusts its approach as follows: • Document Relevance Evaluation: Retrieved documents are assessed for relevance by the Relevance Evalua- tion Agent. Documents below the relevance threshold trigger corrective steps. • Query Refinement and Augmentation: Queries are refined by the Query Refinement Agent, which leverages semantic understanding to optimize retrieval for better results. 19 Figure 19: Overview of Agentic Corrective RAG • Dynamic Retrieval from External Sources: When context is insufficient, the External Knowledge Retrieval Agent performs web searches or accesses alternative data sources to supplement the retrieved documents. • Response Synthesis: All validated and refined information is passed to the Response Synthesis Agent for final response generation. Workflow: The Corrective RAG system is built on five key agents: 1. Context Retrieval Agent: Responsible for retrieving initial context documents from a vector database. 2. Relevance Evaluation Agent: Assesses the retrieved documents for relevance and flags any irrelevant or ambiguous documents for corrective actions. 3. Query Refinement Agent: Rewrites queries to improve retrieval, leveraging semantic understanding to optimize results. 4. External Knowledge Retrieval Agent: Performs web searches or accesses alternative data sources when the context documents are insufficient. 5. Response Synthesis Agent: Synthesizes all validated information into a coherent and accurate response. Key Features and Advantages: • Iterative Correction: Ensures high response accuracy by dynamically identifying and correcting irrelevant or ambiguous retrieval results. • Dynamic Adaptability: Incorporates real-time web searches and query refinement for enhanced retrieval precision. • Agentic Modularity: Each agent performs specialized tasks, ensuring efficient and scalable operation. • Factuality Assurance: By validating all retrieved and generated content, Corrective RAG minimizes the risk of hallucination or
