AI. Despite these advancements, LLMs face significant limitations due to their reliance on static pre-training data. This reliance often results in outdated information, hallucinated responses [7], and an inability to adapt to dynamic, real-world scenarios. These challenges emphasize the need for systems that can integrate real-time data and dynamically refine responses to maintain contextual relevance and accuracy. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [8, 9] emerged as a promising solution to these challenges. By combining the generative capabilities of LLMs with external retrieval mechanisms [10], RAG systems enhance the relevance and timeliness of responses. These systems retrieve real-time information from sources such as knowledge bases [11], APIs, or the web, effectively bridging the gap between static training data and the demands of dynamic applications. However, traditional RAG workflows remain limited by their linear and static design, which restricts their ability to perform complex multi-step reasoning, integrate deep contextual understanding, and iteratively refine responses. The evolution of agents [12] has significantly enhanced the capabilities of AI systems. Modern agents, including LLM-powered and mobile agents [13], are intelligent entities capable of perceiving, reasoning, and autonomously executing tasks. These agents leverage agentic patterns, such as reflection [14], planning [15], tool use, and multi-agent collaboration [16], to enhance decision-making and adaptability. Furthermore, these agents employ agentic workflow patterns [12, 13], such as prompt chaining, routing, parallelization, orchestrator-worker models, and evaluator-optimizer , to structure and optimize task execution. By integrating these patterns, Agentic RAG systems can efficiently manage dynamic workflows and address complex problem-solving scenarios. The convergence of RAG and agentic intelligence has given rise to Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG) [14], a paradigm that integrates agents into the RAG pipeline. Agentic RAG enables dynamic retrieval strategies, contextual understanding, and iterative refinement [ 15], allowing for adaptive and efficient information processing. Unlike traditional RAG, Agentic RAG employs autonomous
