• Voting: Using multiple models to cross-check code for vulnerabilities or analyze content moderation decisions. 4.4 Orchestrator-Workers: Dynamic Task Delegation This workflow [12, 13] features a central orchestrator model that dynamically breaks tasks into subtasks, assigns them to specialized worker models, and compiles the results. Unlike parallelization, it adapts to varying input complexity. Figure 14: Illustration of Orchestrator-Workers Workflow When to Use: Best suited for tasks requiring dynamic decomposition and real-time adaptation, where subtasks are not predefined. 13 Example Applications: • Automatically modifying multiple files in a codebase based on the nature of requested changes. • Conducting real-time research by gathering and synthesizing relevant information from multiple sources. 4.5 Evaluator-Optimizer: Refining Output Through Iteration The evaluator-optimizer [12, 13] workflow iteratively improves content by generating an initial output and refining it based on feedback from an evaluation model. Figure 15: Illustration of Evaluator-Optimizer Workflow When to Use: Effective when iterative refinement significantly enhances response quality, especially when clear evaluation criteria exist. Example Applications: • Improving literary translations through multiple evaluation and refinement cycles. • Conducting multi-round research queries where additional iterations refine search results. 5 Taxonomy of Agentic RAG Systems Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems can be categorized into distinct architectural frameworks based on their complexity and design principles. These include single-agent architectures, multi-agent systems, and hi- erarchical agentic architectures. Each framework is tailored to address specific challenges and optimize performance for diverse applications. This section provides a detailed taxonomy of these architectures, highlighting their characteristics, strengths, and limitations. 5.1 Single-Agent Agentic RAG: Router A Single-Agent Agentic RAG: [30] serves as a centralized decision-making system where a single agent manages the retrieval, routing, and integration of information (as shown in Figure. 16). This architecture simplifies the system by consolidating these tasks into one unified agent, making it particularly effective for setups
