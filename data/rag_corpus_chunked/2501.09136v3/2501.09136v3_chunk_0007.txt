integration. Key innovations in Modular RAG include: • Hybrid Retrieval Strategies: Combining sparse retrieval methods (e.g., a sparse encoder-BM25) with dense retrieval techniques [21] (e.g., DPR - Dense Passage Retrieval ) to maximize accuracy across diverse query types. • Tool Integration: Incorporating external APIs, databases, or computational tools to handle specialized tasks, such as real-time data analysis or domain-specific computations. • Composable Pipelines: Modular RAG enables retrievers, generators, and other components to be replaced, enhanced, or reconfigured independently, allowing high adaptability to specific use cases. For instance, a Modular RAG system designed for financial analytics might retrieve live stock prices via APIs, analyze historical trends using dense retrieval, and generate actionable investment insights through a tailored language model. This modularity and customization make Modular RAG ideal for complex, multi-domain tasks, offering both scalability and precision. 5 Figure 5: Overview of Modular RAG 2.3.4 Graph RAG Graph RAG [16] extends traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems by integrating graph-based data structures as illustrated in Figure 6. These systems leverage the relationships and hierarchies within graph data to enhance multi- hop reasoning and contextual enrichment. By incorporating graph-based retrieval, Graph RAG enables richer and more accurate generative outputs, particularly for tasks requiring relational understanding. Graph RAG is characterized by its ability to: • Node Connectivity: Captures and reasons over relationships between entities. • Hierarchical Knowledge Management : Handles structured and unstructured data through graph-based hierarchies. • Context Enrichment: Adds relational understanding by leveraging graph-based pathways. However, Graph RAG has some limitations: • Limited Scalability: The reliance on graph structures can restrict scalability, especially with extensive data sources. • Data Dependency: High-quality graph data is essential for meaningful outputs, limiting its applicability in unstructured or poorly annotated datasets. • Complexity of Integration: Integrating graph data with unstructured retrieval systems increases design and implementation complexity.
