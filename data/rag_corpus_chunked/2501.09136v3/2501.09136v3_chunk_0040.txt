with customer preferences, competitor analysis, and multimedia content. Key Benefits: • Multi-Modal Capabilities: Integrates text, image, and video data for comprehensive outputs. • Enhanced Creativity: Generates innovative ideas and solutions for marketing and entertainment. • Dynamic Adaptability: Adapts to evolving market trends and customer needs. The applications of Agentic RAG systems span a wide range of industries, showcasing their versatility and transformative potential. From personalized customer support to adaptive education and graph-enhanced multimodal workflows, these systems address complex, dynamic, and knowledge-intensive challenges. By integrating retrieval, generation, and agentic intelligence, Agentic RAG systems are paving the way for next-generation AI applications. 8 Tools and Frameworks for Agentic RAG Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems represent a significant evolution in combining retrieval, generation, and agentic intelligence. These systems extend the capabilities of traditional RAG by integrating decision- making, query reformulation, and adaptive workflows. The following tools and frameworks provide robust support for developing Agentic RAG systems, addressing the complex requirements of real-world applications. Key Tools and Frameworks: • LangChain and LangGraph: LangChain [42] provides modular components for building RAG pipelines, seamlessly integrating retrievers, generators, and external tools. LangGraph complements this by introducing graph-based workflows that support loops, state persistence, and human-in-the-loop interactions, enabling sophisticated orchestration and self-correction mechanisms in agentic systems. • LlamaIndex: LlamaIndex’s [43] Agentic Document Workflows (ADW) enable end-to-end automation of document processing, retrieval, and structured reasoning. It introduces a meta-agent architecture where sub-agents manage smaller document sets, coordinating through a top-level agent for tasks such as compliance analysis and contextual understanding. • Hugging Face Transformers and Qdrant: Hugging Face [44] offers pre-trained models for embedding and generation tasks, while Qdrant [ 45] enhances retrieval workflows with adaptive vector search capabilities, allowing agents to optimize performance by dynamically switching between sparse and dense vector methods. 31 • CrewAI and AutoGen: These
