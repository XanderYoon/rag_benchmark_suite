• Optionally conducts a web search to identify local conditions affecting delivery, such as weather or logistical delays. 3. Data Integration and LLM Synthesis: • The relevant data is passed to the LLM, which synthesizes the information into a coherent response. 4. Output Generation: • The system generates an actionable and concise response, providing live tracking updates and potential alternatives. Response: Integrated Response: “Your package is currently in transit and expected to arrive tomorrow evening. The live tracking from UPS indicates it is at the regional distribution center.” 5.2 Multi-Agent Agentic RAG Systems: Multi-Agent RAG [30] represents a modular and scalable evolution of single-agent architectures, designed to handle complex workflows and diverse query types by leveraging multiple specialized agents (as shown in Figure 17). Instead of relying on a single agent to manage all tasks—reasoning, retrieval, and response generation—this system distributes responsibilities across multiple agents, each optimized for a specific role or data source. Workflow 1. Query Submission: The process begins with a user query, which is received by a coordinator agent or master retrieval agent. This agent acts as the central orchestrator, delegating the query to specialized retrieval agents based on the query’s requirements. 2. Specialized Retrieval Agents: The query is distributed among multiple retrieval agents, each focusing on a specific type of data source or task. Examples include: • Agent 1: Handles structured queries, such as interacting with SQL-based databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL. • Agent 2: Manages semantic searches for retrieving unstructured data from sources like PDFs, books, or internal records. • Agent 3: Focuses on retrieving real-time public information from web searches or APIs. • Agent 4: Specializes in recommendation systems, delivering context-aware suggestions based on user behavior or profiles. 3. Tool Access and Data Retrieval: Each agent routes the query to the appropriate tools or
