and Section 10 concludes with future directions for Agentic RAG systems. 2 Foundations of Retrieval-Augmented Generation 2.1 Overview of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) represents a significant advancement in the field of artificial intelligence, combining the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with real-time data retrieval. While LLMs have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing, their reliance on static pre-trained data often results in outdated or incomplete responses. RAG addresses this limitation by dynamically retrieving relevant information from external sources and incorporating it into the generative process, enabling contextually accurate and up-to-date outputs. 2 Figure 1: An Overview of Agentic RAG 2.2 Core Components of RAG The architecture of RAG systems integrates three primary components (Figure2): • Retrieveal: Responsible for querying external data sources such as knowledge bases, APIs, or vector databases. Advanced retrievers leverage dense vector search and transformer-based models to improve retrieval precision and semantic relevance. • Augmentation: Processes retrieved data, extracting and summarizing the most relevant information to align with the query context. • Generation: Combines retrieved information with the LLM’s pre-trained knowledge to generate coherent, contextually appropriate responses. 2.3 Evolution of RAG Paradigms The field of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has evolved significantly to address the increasing complexity of real-world applications, where contextual accuracy, scalability, and multi-step reasoning are critical. What began as simple keyword-based retrieval has transitioned into sophisticated, modular, and adaptive systems capable of integrating diverse data sources and autonomous decision-making processes. This evolution underscores the growing need for RAG systems to handle complex queries efficiently and effectively. This section examines the progression of RAG paradigms, presenting key stages of development—Naïve RAG, Advanced RAG, Modular RAG, Graph RAG, and Agentic RAG alongside their defining characteristics, strengths, and 3 Figure 2: Core Components of RAG limitations. By understanding the evolution of these paradigms,
