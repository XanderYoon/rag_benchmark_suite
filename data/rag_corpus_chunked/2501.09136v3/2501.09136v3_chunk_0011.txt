In time-sensitive settings such as financial analytics or live customer support, delays caused by querying multiple databases or processing large document sets can hinder the system’s overall utility. For example, a delay in retrieving market trends during high-frequency trading could result in missed opportunities. 2.5 Agentic RAG: A Paradigm Shift Traditional RAG systems, with their static workflows and limited adaptability, often struggle to handle dynamic, multi- step reasoning and complex real-world tasks. These limitations have spurred the integration of agentic intelligence, 8 resulting in Agentic RAG. By incorporating autonomous agents capable of dynamic decision-making, iterative reasoning, and adaptive retrieval strategies, Agentic RAG builds on the modularity of earlier paradigms while overcoming their inherent constraints. This evolution enables more complex, multi-domain tasks to be addressed with enhanced precision and contextual understanding, positioning Agentic RAG as a cornerstone for next-generation AI applications. In particular, Agentic RAG systems reduce latency through optimized workflows and refine outputs iteratively, tackling the very challenges that have historically hindered traditional RAG’s scalability and effectiveness. 3 Core Principles and Background of Agentic Intelligence Agentic Intelligence forms the foundation of Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, enabling them to transcend the static and reactive nature of traditional RAG. By integrating autonomous agents capable of dynamic decision-making, iterative reasoning, and collaborative workflows, Agentic RAG systems exhibit enhanced adaptability and precision. This section explores the core principles underpinning agentic intelligence. Components of an AI Agent. In essence, an AI agent comprises (Figure. 7): • LLM (with defined Role and Task): Serves as the agent’s primary reasoning engine and dialogue interface. It interprets user queries, generates responses, and maintains coherence. • Memory (Short-Term and Long-Term): Captures context and relevant data across interactions. Short-term memory [22] tracks immediate conversation state, while long-term memory [22]stores accumulated knowledge and agent experiences. • Planning (Reflection & Self-Critique):
