top-level agent for tasks such as compliance analysis and contextual understanding. • Hugging Face Transformers and Qdrant: Hugging Face [44] offers pre-trained models for embedding and generation tasks, while Qdrant [ 45] enhances retrieval workflows with adaptive vector search capabilities, allowing agents to optimize performance by dynamically switching between sparse and dense vector methods. 31 • CrewAI and AutoGen: These frameworks emphasize multi-agent architectures. CrewAI [ 46] supports hierarchical and sequential processes, robust memory systems, and tool integrations. AG2 [ 47] (formerly knows as AutoGen [48, 49]) excels in multi-agent collaboration with advanced support for code generation, tool execution, and decision-making. • OpenAI Swarm Framework: An educational framework designed for ergonomic, lightweight multi-agent orchestration [50], emphasizing agent autonomy and structured collaboration. • Agentic RAG with Vertex AI: Developed by Google, Vertex AI [51] integrates seamlessly with Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), providing a platform to build, deploy, and scale machine learning models while leveraging advanced AI capabilities for robust, contextually aware retrieval and decision-making workflows. • Semantic Kernel: Semantic Kernel [52, 53] is an open-source SDK by Microsoft that integrates large language models (LLMs) into applications. It supports agentic patterns, enabling the creation of autonomous AI agents for natural language understanding, task automation, and decision-making. It has been used in scenarios like ServiceNow’s P1 incident management to facilitate real-time collaboration, automate task execution, and retrieve contextual information seamlessly • Amazon Bedrock for Agentic RAG: Amazon Bedrock [37] provides a robust platform for implementing Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows. • IBM Watson and Agentic RAG:IBM’s watsonx.ai [54] supports building Agentic RAG systems, exemplified by using the Granite-3-8B-Instruct model to answer complex queries by integrating external information and enhancing response accuracy. • Neo4j and Vector Databases: Neo4j, a prominent open-source graph database, excels in handling complex relationships and semantic queries. Alongside Neo4j, vector
