However, their reliance on static training data limits their ability to respond to dynamic, real-time queries, resulting in outdated or inaccurate outputs. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a solution, enhancing LLMs by integrating real-time data retrieval to provide contextually relevant and up-to-date responses. Despite its promise, traditional RAG systems are constrained by static workflows and lack the adaptability required for multi-step reasoning and complex task management. Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG) transcends these limitations by embedding autonomous AI agents into the RAG pipeline. These agents leverage agentic design patterns reflec- tion, planning, tool use, and multi-agent collaboration to dynamically manage retrieval strategies, iteratively refine contextual understanding, and adapt workflows through clearly defined operational structures ranging from sequential steps to adaptive collaboration. This integration enables Agentic RAG systems to deliver unparalleled flexibility, scalability, and context-awareness across diverse applications. This survey provides a comprehensive exploration of Agentic RAG, beginning with its foundational principles and the evolution of RAG paradigms. It presents a detailed taxonomy of Agentic RAG archi- tectures, highlights key applications in industries such as healthcare, finance, and education, and exam- ines practical implementation strategies. Additionally, it addresses challenges in scaling these systems, ensuring ethical decision-making, and optimizing performance for real-world applications, while providing detailed insights into frameworks and tools for implementing Agentic RAG 1.
