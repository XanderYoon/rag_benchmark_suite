these limitations, Naïve RAG systems provided a critical proof-of-concept for integrating retrieval with generation, laying the foundation for more sophisticated paradigms. 2.3.2 Advanced RAG Advanced RAG [20] systems build upon the limitations of Naïve RAG by incorporating semantic understanding and enhanced retrieval techniques. Figure 4 highlights the semantic enhancements in retrieval and the iterative, context- aware pipeline of Advanced RAG. These systems leverage dense retrieval models, such as Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR), and neural ranking algorithms to improve retrieval precision. Key features of Advanced RAG include: 4 Figure 4: Overview of Advanced RAG • Dense Vector Search: Queries and documents are represented in high-dimensional vector spaces, enabling better semantic alignment between the user query and retrieved documents. • Contextual Re-Ranking: Neural models re-rank retrieved documents to prioritize the most contextually relevant information. • Iterative Retrieval: Advanced RAG introduces multi-hop retrieval mechanisms, enabling reasoning across multiple documents for complex queries. These advancements make Advanced RAG suitable for applications requiring high precision and nuanced understanding, such as research synthesis and personalized recommendations. However, challenges such as computational overhead and limited scalability persist, particularly when dealing with large datasets or multi-step queries. 2.3.3 Modular RAG Modular RAG [ 20] represents the latest evolution in RAG paradigms, emphasizing flexibility and customization. These systems decompose the retrieval and generation pipeline into independent, reusable components, enabling domain-specific optimization and task adaptability. Figure 5 demonstrates the modular architecture, showcasing hybrid retrieval strategies, composable pipelines, and external tool integration. Key innovations in Modular RAG include: • Hybrid Retrieval Strategies: Combining sparse retrieval methods (e.g., a sparse encoder-BM25) with dense retrieval techniques [21] (e.g., DPR - Dense Passage Retrieval ) to maximize accuracy across diverse query types. • Tool Integration: Incorporating external APIs, databases, or computational tools to handle specialized tasks, such as real-time data analysis or domain-specific computations.
