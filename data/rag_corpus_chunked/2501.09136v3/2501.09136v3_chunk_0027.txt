Unlike static retrieval workflows, Adaptive RAG [ 34] employs a classifier to assess query complexity and determine the most appropriate approach, ranging from single-step retrieval to multi-step reasoning, or even bypassing retrieval altogether for straightforward queries as illustrated in Figure 20. Figure 20: An Overview of Adaptive Agentic RAG Key Idea of Adaptive RAG The core principle of Adaptive RAG lies in its ability to dynamically tailor retrieval strategies based on the complexity of the query. Adaptive RAG adjusts its approach as follows: 21 • Straightforward Queries: For fact-based questions that require no additional retrieval (e.g., "What is the boiling point of water?"), the system directly generates an answer using pre-existing knowledge. • Simple Queries: For moderately complex tasks requiring minimal context (e.g., "What is the status of my latest electricity bill?"), the system performs a single-step retrieval to fetch the relevant details. • Complex Queries: For multi-layered queries requiring iterative reasoning (e.g., "How has the population of City X changed over the past decade, and what are the contributing factors?"), the system employs multi-step retrieval, progressively refining intermediate results to provide a comprehensive answer. Workflow: The Adaptive RAG system is built on three primary components: 1. Classifier Role: • A smaller language model analyzes the query to predict its complexity. • The classifier is trained using automatically labeled datasets, derived from past model outcomes and query patterns. 2. Dynamic Strategy Selection: • For straightforward queries, the system avoids unnecessary retrieval, directly leveraging the LLM for response generation. • For simple queries, it employs a single-step retrieval
