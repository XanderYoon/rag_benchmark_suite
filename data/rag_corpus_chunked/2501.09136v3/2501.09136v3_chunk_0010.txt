Traditional RAG systems are often ill-equipped to refine retrieval based on intermediate insights or user feedback, resulting in incomplete or disjointed responses. Example: A complex query like, "What lessons from renewable energy policies in Europe can be applied to developing nations, and what are the potential economic impacts?" demands the orchestration of multiple types of information, including policy data, contextualization for developing regions, and economic analysis. Traditional RAG systems typically fail to connect these disparate elements into a cohesive response. 2.4.3 Scalability and Latency Issues As the volume of external data sources grows, querying and ranking large datasets becomes increasingly computationally intensive. This results in significant latency, which undermines the system’s ability to provide timely responses in real-time applications. Example: In time-sensitive settings such as financial analytics or live customer support, delays caused by querying multiple databases or processing large document sets can hinder the system’s overall utility. For example, a delay in retrieving market trends during high-frequency trading could result in missed opportunities. 2.5 Agentic RAG: A Paradigm Shift Traditional RAG systems, with their static workflows and limited adaptability,
