complex document-centric processes, integrating document parsing, retrieval, reasoning, and structured outputs with intelligent agents (see Figure 23). ADW systems address limitations of Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) and RAG by maintaining state, coordinating multi-step workflows, and applying domain-specific logic to documents. Workflow 1. Document Parsing and Information Structuring: • Documents are parsed using enterprise-grade tools (e.g., LlamaParse) to extract relevant data fields such as invoice numbers, dates, vendor information, line items, and payment terms. • Structured data is organized for downstream processing. 2. State Maintenance Across Processes: • The system maintains state about document context, ensuring consistency and relevance across multi-step workflows. • Tracks the progression of the document through various processing stages. 3. Knowledge Retrieval: • Relevant references are retrieved from external knowledge bases (e.g., LlamaCloud) or vector indexes. • Retrieves real-time, domain-specific guidelines for enhanced decision-making. 4. Agentic Orchestration: • Intelligent agents apply business rules, perform multi-hop reasoning, and generate actionable recommen- dations. • Orchestrates components such as parsers, retrievers, and external APIs for seamless integration. 5. Actionable Output Generation: • Outputs are presented in structured formats, tailored to specific use cases. • Recommendations and extracted insights are synthesized into concise and actionable reports. 27 Figure 23: An Overview of Agentic Document Workflows (ADW) [36] Use Case: Invoice Payments Workflow Prompt: Generate a payment recommendation report based on the submitted invoice and associated vendor contract terms. System Process (ADW Workflow): 1. Parse the invoice to extract key details such as invoice number, date, vendor information, line items, and payment terms. 2. Retrieve the corresponding vendor contract to verify payment terms and identify any applicable discounts or compliance requirements. 3. Generate a payment recommendation report that includes original amount due, potential early payment discounts, budget impact analysis, and strategic payment actions.
