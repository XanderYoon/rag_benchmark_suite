systems, from their initial implementations to advanced paradigms like Modular RAG, highlighting the contributions and limitations of each. The integration of agents into the RAG pipeline has emerged as a pivotal development, resulting in Agentic RAG systems that overcome static workflows and limited contextual adaptability. Applications across healthcare, finance, education, and creative industries demonstrate the transformative potential of these systems, showcasing their ability to deliver personalized, real-time, and context-aware solutions. Despite their promise, Agentic RAG systems face challenges that require further research and innovation. Coordination complexity in multi-agent architectures, scalability, and latency issues, as well as ethical considerations, must be addressed to ensure robust and responsible deployment. Additionally, the lack of specialized benchmarks and datasets tailored to evaluate agentic capabilities poses a significant hurdle. Developing evaluation methodologies that capture the unique aspects of Agentic RAG, such as multi-agent collaboration and dynamic adaptability, will be crucial for advancing the field. Looking ahead, the convergence of retrieval-augmented generation and agentic intelligence has the potential to redefine AI’s role in dynamic and complex environments. By addressing these challenges and exploring future directions, researchers and practitioners can unlock the full potential of Agentic RAG systems, paving the way for transformative applications across industries and domains. As AI systems continue to evolve, Agentic RAG stands as a cornerstone for creating adaptive, context-aware, and impactful solutions that meet the demands of a rapidly changing world.
