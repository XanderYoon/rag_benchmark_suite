these architectures, highlighting their characteristics, strengths, and limitations. 5.1 Single-Agent Agentic RAG: Router A Single-Agent Agentic RAG: [30] serves as a centralized decision-making system where a single agent manages the retrieval, routing, and integration of information (as shown in Figure. 16). This architecture simplifies the system by consolidating these tasks into one unified agent, making it particularly effective for setups with a limited number of tools or data sources. Workflow 1. Query Submission and Evaluation: The process begins when a user submits a query. A coordinating agent (or master retrieval agent) receives the query and analyzes it to determine the most suitable sources of information. 2. Knowledge Source Selection: Based on the query’s type, the coordinating agent chooses from a variety of retrieval options: 14 • Structured Databases: For queries requiring tabular data access, the system may use a Text-to-SQL engine that interacts with databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL. • Semantic Search: When dealing with unstructured information, it retrieves relevant documents (e.g., PDFs, books, organizational records) using vector-based retrieval. • Web Search: For real-time or broad contextual information, the system leverages a web search tool to access the latest online data. • Recommendation Systems: For personalized or contextual queries, the system taps into recommendation engines that provide tailored suggestions. 3. Data Integration and LLM Synthesis: Once the relevant data is retrieved from the chosen sources, it is passed to a Large Language Model (LLM). The LLM synthesizes the gathered information, integrating insights from multiple sources into a coherent and contextually relevant response. 4. Output Generation: Finally, the system delivers a comprehensive, user-facing answer that addresses the original query. This response is presented in an actionable, concise format and may optionally include references or citations to the sources used.
