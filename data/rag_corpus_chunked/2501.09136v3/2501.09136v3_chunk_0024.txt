accuracy and coherence of responses. Challenges • Coordination Complexity: Maintaining robust inter-agent communication across multiple levels can increase orchestration overhead. • Resource Allocation: Efficiently distributing tasks among tiers to avoid bottlenecks is non-trivial. Use Case: Financial Analysis System Prompt: What are the best investment options given the current market trends in renewable energy? System Process (Hierarchical Agentic Workflow): 1. Top-Tier Agent: Assesses the query’s complexity and prioritizes reliable financial databases and economic indicators over less validated data sources. 2. Mid-Level Agent: Retrieves real-time market data (e.g., stock prices, sector performance) from proprietary APIs and structured SQL databases. 3. Lower-Level Agent(s): Conducts web searches for recent policy announcements and consults recom- mendation systems that track expert opinions and news analytics. 4. Aggregation and Synthesis: The top-tier agent compiles the results, integrating quantitative data with policy insights. Response: Integrated Response: “Based on current market data, renewable energy stocks have shown a 15% growth over the past quarter, driven by supportive government policies and heightened investor interest. Analysts suggest that wind and solar sectors, in particular, may experience continued momentum, while emerging technologies like green hydrogen present moderate risk but potentially high returns.” 5.4 Agentic Corrective RAG Corrective RAG :introduces mechanisms to self-correct retrieval results, enhancing document utilization and improving response generation quality as demonstrated in Figure 19. By embedding intelligent agents into the workflow, Corrective RAG [31] [32] ensures iterative refinement of context documents and responses, minimizing errors and maximizing relevance. Key Idea of Corrective RAG: The core principle of Corrective RAG lies in its ability to evaluate retrieved documents dynamically, perform corrective actions, and refine queries to enhance the quality of generated responses. Corrective RAG adjusts its approach as follows: • Document Relevance Evaluation: Retrieved documents are assessed for relevance by the Relevance Evalua- tion Agent. Documents below the relevance threshold
