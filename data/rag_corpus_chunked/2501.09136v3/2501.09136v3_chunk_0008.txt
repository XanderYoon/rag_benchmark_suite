pathways. However, Graph RAG has some limitations: • Limited Scalability: The reliance on graph structures can restrict scalability, especially with extensive data sources. • Data Dependency: High-quality graph data is essential for meaningful outputs, limiting its applicability in unstructured or poorly annotated datasets. • Complexity of Integration: Integrating graph data with unstructured retrieval systems increases design and implementation complexity. Graph RAG is well-suited for applications such as healthcare diagnostics, legal research, and other domains where reasoning over structured relationships is crucial. 2.3.5 Agentic RAG Agentic RAG represents a paradigm shift by introducing autonomous agents capable of dynamic decision-making and workflow optimization. Unlike static systems, Agentic RAG employs iterative refinement and adaptive retrieval strategies to address complex, real-time, and multi-domain queries. This paradigm leverages the modularity of retrieval and generation processes while introducing agent-based autonomy. 6 Figure 6: Overview of Graph RAG Key characteristics of Agentic RAG include: • Autonomous Decision-Making: Agents independently evaluate and manage retrieval strategies based on query complexity. • Iterative Refinement: Incorporates feedback loops to improve retrieval accuracy and response relevance. • Workflow Optimization: Dynamically orchestrates tasks, enabling efficiency in real-time applications. Despite its advancements, Agentic RAG faces some challenges: • Coordination Complexity : Managing interactions between agents requires sophisticated orchestration mechanisms. • Computational Overhead: The use of multiple agents increases resource requirements for complex work- flows. • Scalability Limitations: While scalable, the dynamic nature of the system can strain computational resources for high query volumes. Agentic RAG excels in domains like customer support, financial analytics, and adaptive learning platforms, where dynamic adaptability and contextual precision are paramount. 2.4 Challenges and Limitations of Traditional RAG Systems Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have significantly expanded the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating real-time data retrieval. However, these systems still face critical challenges that hinder their effectiveness
