semantic searches for retrieving unstructured data from sources like PDFs, books, or internal records. • Agent 3: Focuses on retrieving real-time public information from web searches or APIs. • Agent 4: Specializes in recommendation systems, delivering context-aware suggestions based on user behavior or profiles. 3. Tool Access and Data Retrieval: Each agent routes the query to the appropriate tools or data sources within its domain, such as: • Vector Search: For semantic relevance. • Text-to-SQL: For structured data. • Web Search: For real-time public information. • APIs: For accessing external services or proprietary systems. The retrieval process is executed in parallel, allowing for efficient processing of diverse query types. 16 Figure 17: An Overview of Multi-Agent Agentic RAG Systems 4. Data Integration and LLM Synthesis: Once retrieval is complete, the data from all agents is passed to a Large Language Model (LLM). The LLM synthesizes the retrieved information into a coherent and contextually relevant response, integrating insights from multiple sources seamlessly. 5. Output Generation: The system generates a comprehensive response, which is delivered back to the user in an actionable and concise format. Key Features and Advantages. • Modularity: Each agent operates independently, allowing for seamless addition or removal of agents based on system requirements. • Scalability: Parallel processing by multiple agents enables the system to handle high query volumes efficiently. • Task Specialization: Each agent is optimized for a specific type of query or data source, improving accuracy and retrieval relevance. • Efficiency: By distributing tasks across specialized agents, the system minimizes bottlenecks and enhances performance for complex workflows. • Versatility: Suitable for applications spanning multiple domains, including research, analytics, decision- making, and customer support. Challenges • Coordination Complexity: Managing inter-agent communication and task delegation requires sophisticated orchestration mechanisms. • Computational Overhead: Parallel processing of multiple agents can increase
