and quality of retrieved information, ensuring alignment with the query. • Feedback Loops: Refines retrieval and synthesis through iterative validation and re-querying. Workflow: The Agent-G system is built on four primary components: 1. Retriever Bank: • A modular set of agents specializes in retrieving graph-based or unstructured data. • Agents dynamically select relevant sources based on the query’s requirements. 2. Critic Module: • Validates retrieved data for relevance and quality. • Flags low-confidence results for re-retrieval or refinement. 3. Dynamic Agent Interaction: • Task-specific agents collaborate to integrate diverse data types. • Ensures cohesive retrieval and synthesis across graph and text sources. 4. LLM Integration: • Synthesizes validated data into a coherent response. • Iterative feedback from the critic ensures alignment with the query’s intent. Key Features and Advantages • Enhanced Reasoning: Combines structured relationships from graphs with contextual information from unstructured documents. • Dynamic Adaptability: Adjusts retrieval strategies dynamically based on query requirements. • Improved Accuracy: Critic module reduces the risk of irrelevant or low-quality data in responses. • Scalable Modularity: Supports the addition of new agents for specialized tasks, enhancing scalability. 24 Use Case: Healthcare Diagnostics Prompt: What are the common symptoms of Type 2 Diabetes, and how are they related to heart disease? System Process (Agent-G Workflow): 1. Query Reception and Assignment: The system receives the query and identifies the need for both graph-structured and unstructured data to answer the question comprehensively. 2. Graph Retriever: • Extracts relationships between Type 2 Diabetes and heart disease from a medical knowledge graph. • Identifies shared risk factors such as obesity and high blood pressure by exploring graph hierar- chies and relationships. 3. Document Retriever: • Retrieves descriptions of Type 2 Diabetes symptoms (e.g., increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue) from medical literature. • Adds contextual information to complement the graph-based
