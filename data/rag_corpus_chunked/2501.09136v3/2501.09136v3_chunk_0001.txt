These models have driven innovation across diverse domains, including conversational agents [4], automated content creation, and real-time translation. Recent advancements have extended their capabilities to multimodal tasks, such as text-to-image and text-to-video generation [5], enabling the creation and editing of videos and images from detailed prompts [6], which broadens the potential applications of generative AI. Despite these advancements, LLMs face significant limitations due to their reliance on static pre-training data. This reliance often results in outdated information, hallucinated responses [7], and an inability to adapt to dynamic, real-world scenarios. These challenges emphasize the need for systems that can integrate real-time data and dynamically refine responses to maintain contextual relevance and accuracy. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
