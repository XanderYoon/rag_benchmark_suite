Traditional RAG Agentic RAG Agentic Document Workflows (ADW) Focus Isolated retrieval and generation tasks Multi-agent collaboration and reasoning Document-centric end-to-end workflows Context Maintenance Limited Enabled through memory modules Maintains state across multi-step workflows Dynamic Adaptability Minimal High Tailored to document workflows Workflow Orchestration Absent Orchestrates multi-agent tasks Integrates multi-step document processing Use of External Tools/APIs Basic integration (e.g., retrieval tools) Extends via tools like APIs and knowledge bases Deeply integrates business rules and domain-specific tools Scalability Limited to small datasets or queries Scalable for multi-agent systems Scales for multi-domain enterprise workflows Complex Reasoning Basic (e.g., simple Q&A) Multi-step reasoning with agents Structured reasoning across documents Primary Applications QA systems, knowledge retrieval Multi-domain knowledge and reasoning Contract review, invoice processing, claims analysis Strengths Simplicity, quick setup High accuracy, collaborative reasoning End-to-end automation, domain-specific intelligence Challenges Poor contextual understanding Coordination complexity Resource overhead, domain standardization The comparative analysis underscores the evolutionary trajectory from Traditional RAG to Agentic RAG and further to Agentic Document Workflows (ADW). While Traditional RAG offers simplicity and ease of deployment for basic tasks, Agentic RAG introduces enhanced reasoning and scalability through multi-agent collaboration. ADW builds upon these advancements by providing robust, document-centric workflows that facilitate end-to-end automation and integration with domain-specific processes. Understanding the strengths and limitations of each framework is crucial for selecting the most appropriate architecture to meet specific application requirements and operational demands. 7 Applications of Agentic RAG Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have demonstrated transformative potential across a variety of domains.
