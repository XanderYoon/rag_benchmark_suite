Correction: Ensures high response accuracy by dynamically identifying and correcting irrelevant or ambiguous retrieval results. • Dynamic Adaptability: Incorporates real-time web searches and query refinement for enhanced retrieval precision. • Agentic Modularity: Each agent performs specialized tasks, ensuring efficient and scalable operation. • Factuality Assurance: By validating all retrieved and generated content, Corrective RAG minimizes the risk of hallucination or misinformation. 20 Use Case: Academic Research Assistant Prompt: What are the latest findings in generative AI research? System Process (Corrective RAG Workflow): 1. Query Submission: A user submits the query to the system. 2. Context Retrieval: • The Context Retrieval Agent retrieves initial documents from a database of published papers on generative AI. • The retrieved documents are passed to the next step for evaluation. 3. Relevance Evaluation: • The Relevance Evaluation Agent assesses the documents for alignment with the query. • Documents are classified into relevant, ambiguous, or irrelevant categories. Irrelevant documents are flagged for corrective actions. 4. Corrective Actions (if needed): • The Query Refinement Agent rewrites the query to improve specificity and relevance. • The External Knowledge Retrieval Agent performs web searches to fetch additional papers and reports from external sources. 5. Response Synthesis: • The Response Synthesis Agent integrates validated documents into a coherent and comprehensive summary. Response: Integrated Response: “Recent findings in generative AI highlight advancements in diffusion models, reinforce- ment learning for text-to-video tasks, and optimization techniques for large-scale model training. For more details, refer to studies published in NeurIPS 2024 and AAAI 2025.” 5.5 Adaptive Agentic RAG Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Adaptive RAG)[33] enhances the flexibility and efficiency of large language models (LLMs) by dynamically adjusting query handling strategies based on the complexity of the incoming query. Unlike static retrieval workflows, Adaptive RAG [ 34] employs a classifier to assess query complexity and determine
