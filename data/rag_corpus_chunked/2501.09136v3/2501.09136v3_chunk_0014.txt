data beyond their pre-trained knowledge. By dynamically integrating tools into workflows, agents can adapt to complex tasks and provide more accurate and contextually relevant outputs. Modern agentic workflows incorporate tool use for a variety of applications, including information retrieval, computa- tional reasoning, and interfacing with external systems. The implementation of this pattern has evolved significantly with advancements like GPT-4’s function calling capabilities and systems capable of managing access to numerous tools. These developments facilitate sophisticated workflows where agents autonomously select and execute the most relevant tools for a given task. While tool use significantly enhances agentic workflows, challenges remain in optimizing the selection of tools, particularly in contexts with a large number of available options. Techniques inspired by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), such as heuristic-based selection, have been proposed to address this issue. 3.4 Multi-Agent Multi-agent collaboration [29] is a key design pattern in agentic workflows that enables task specialization and parallel processing. Agents communicate and share intermediate results, ensuring the overall workflow remains efficient and coherent. By distributing subtasks among specialized agents, this pattern improves the scalability and adaptability 10 (a) An Overview of Agentic Planning (b) An Overview of Tool Use Figure 9: Overview of Agentic Planning and Tool Use of complex workflows. Multi-agent systems allow developers to decompose intricate tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks assigned to different agents. This approach not only enhances task performance but also provides a robust framework for managing complex interactions. Each agent operates with its own memory and workflow, which can include the use of tools, reflection, or planning, enabling dynamic and collaborative problem-solving (see Figure 10). While multi-agent collaboration offers significant potential, it is a less predictable design pattern compared to more mature workflows like Reflection and Tool Use. Nevertheless, emerging frameworks such as AutoGen, Crew AI, and LangGraph are providing new
