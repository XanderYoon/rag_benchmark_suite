relationships between Type 2 Diabetes and heart disease from a medical knowledge graph. • Identifies shared risk factors such as obesity and high blood pressure by exploring graph hierar- chies and relationships. 3. Document Retriever: • Retrieves descriptions of Type 2 Diabetes symptoms (e.g., increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue) from medical literature. • Adds contextual information to complement the graph-based insights. 4. Critic Module: • Evaluates the relevance and quality of the retrieved graph data and document data. • Flags low-confidence results for refinement or re-querying. 5. Response Synthesis: The LLM integrates validated data from the Graph Retriever and Document Retriever into a coherent response, ensuring alignment with the query’s intent. Response: Integrated Response: “Type 2 Diabetes symptoms include increased thirst, frequent urination, and fatigue. Studies show a 50% correlation between diabetes and heart disease, primarily through shared risk factors such as obesity and high blood pressure.” 5.6.2 GeAR: Graph-Enhanced Agent for Retrieval-Augmented Generation GeAR [35]: introduces an agentic framework that enhances traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by incorporating graph-based retrieval mechanisms. By leveraging graph expansion techniques and an agent-based architecture, GeAR addresses challenges in multi-hop retrieval scenarios, improving the system’s ability to handle complex queries as shown in Figure 22. Key Idea of GeAR GeAR advances RAG performance through two primary innovations: • Graph Expansion: Enhances conventional base retrievers (e.g., BM25) by expanding the retrieval process to include graph-structured data, enabling the system to capture complex relationships and dependencies between entities. • Agent Framework: Incorporates an agent-based architecture that utilizes graph expansion to manage retrieval tasks more effectively, allowing for dynamic and autonomous decision-making in the retrieval process. Workflow: The GeAR system operates through the following components: 1. Graph Expansion Module: • Integrates graph-based data into the retrieval process, allowing the system to consider relationships between entities during retrieval.
