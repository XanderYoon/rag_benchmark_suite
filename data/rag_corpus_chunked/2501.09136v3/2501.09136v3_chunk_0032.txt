between entities. • Agent Framework: Incorporates an agent-based architecture that utilizes graph expansion to manage retrieval tasks more effectively, allowing for dynamic and autonomous decision-making in the retrieval process. Workflow: The GeAR system operates through the following components: 1. Graph Expansion Module: • Integrates graph-based data into the retrieval process, allowing the system to consider relationships between entities during retrieval. • Enhances the base retriever’s ability to handle multi-hop queries by expanding the search space to include connected entities. 2. Agent-Based Retrieval: • Employs an agent framework to manage the retrieval process, enabling dynamic selection and combination of retrieval strategies based on the query’s complexity. • Agents can autonomously decide to utilize graph-expanded retrieval paths to improve the relevance and accuracy of retrieved information. 25 3. LLM Integration: • Combines the retrieved information, enriched by graph expansion, with the capabilities of a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses. • The integration ensures that the generative process is informed by both unstructured documents and structured graph data. Figure 22: An Overview of GeAR: Graph-Enhanced Agent for Retrieval-Augmented Generation[35] Key Features and Advantages • Enhanced Multi-Hop Retrieval: GeAR’s graph expansion allows the system to handle complex queries that require reasoning over multiple interconnected pieces of information. • Agentic Decision-Making: The agent framework enables dynamic and autonomous selection of retrieval strategies, improving efficiency and relevance. • Improved Accuracy: By incorporating structured graph data, GeAR enhances the precision of retrieved information, leading to more accurate and contextually appropriate responses. • Scalability: The modular nature of the agent framework allows for the integration of additional retrieval strategies and data sources as needed. 26 Use Case: Multi-Hop Question Answering Prompt: Which author influenced the mentor of J.K.
