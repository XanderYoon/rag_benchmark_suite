This evolution underscores the growing need for RAG systems to handle complex queries efficiently and effectively. This section examines the progression of RAG paradigms, presenting key stages of development—Naïve RAG, Advanced RAG, Modular RAG, Graph RAG, and Agentic RAG alongside their defining characteristics, strengths, and 3 Figure 2: Core Components of RAG limitations. By understanding the evolution of these paradigms, readers can appreciate the advancements made in retrieval and generative capabilities and their application in various domains 2.3.1 Naïve RAG Naïve RAG [20] represents the foundational implementation of retrieval-augmented generation. Figure 3 illustrates the simple retrieve-read workflow of Naive RAG, focusing on keyword-based retrieval and static datasets.. These systems rely on simple keyword-based retrieval techniques, such as TF-IDF and BM25, to fetch documents from static datasets. The retrieved documents are then used to augment the language model’s generative capabilities. Figure 3: An Overview of Naive RAG. Naïve RAG is characterized by its simplicity and ease of implementation, making it suitable for tasks involving fact-based queries with minimal contextual complexity. However, it suffers from several limitations: • Lack of Contextual Awareness: Retrieved documents often fail to capture the semantic nuances of the query due to reliance on lexical matching rather than semantic understanding. • Fragmented Outputs: The absence of advanced preprocessing or contextual integration often leads to disjointed or overly generic responses. • Scalability Issues: Keyword-based retrieval techniques struggle with large datasets, often failing to identify the most relevant information. Despite these limitations, Naïve RAG systems provided a critical proof-of-concept for integrating retrieval with generation, laying the foundation for more sophisticated paradigms. 2.3.2 Advanced RAG Advanced RAG [20] systems build upon the limitations of Naïve RAG by incorporating semantic understanding and enhanced retrieval techniques. Figure 4 highlights the semantic enhancements in retrieval and the iterative, context- aware pipeline of Advanced RAG.
