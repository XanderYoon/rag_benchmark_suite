7): • LLM (with defined Role and Task): Serves as the agent’s primary reasoning engine and dialogue interface. It interprets user queries, generates responses, and maintains coherence. • Memory (Short-Term and Long-Term): Captures context and relevant data across interactions. Short-term memory [22] tracks immediate conversation state, while long-term memory [22]stores accumulated knowledge and agent experiences. • Planning (Reflection & Self-Critique): Guides the agent’s iterative reasoning process through reflection, query routing, or self-critique[23], ensuring that complex tasks are broken down effectively [24]. • Tools Vector Search, Web Search, APIs, etc.): Expands the agent’s capabilities beyond text generation, enabling access to external resources, real-time data, or specialized computations. Figure 7: An Overview of AI Agents Agentic Patterns [25, 26] provide structured methodologies that guide the behavior of agents in Agentic Retrieval- Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. These patterns enable agents to dynamically adapt, plan, and collaborate, ensuring that the system can handle complex, real-world tasks with precision and scalability. Four key patterns underpin agentic workflows: 3.1 Reflection Reflection is a foundational design pattern in agentic workflows, enabling agents to iteratively evaluate and refine their outputs. By incorporating self-feedback mechanisms, agents can identify and address errors, inconsistencies, and areas for improvement, enhancing performance across tasks like code generation, text production, and question answering ( 9 as shown in Figure 8). In practical use, Reflection involves prompting an agent to critique its outputs for correctness, style, and efficiency, then incorporating this feedback into subsequent iterations. External tools, such as unit tests or web searches, can further enhance this process by validating results and highlighting gaps. In multi-agent systems, Reflection can involve distinct roles, such as one agent generating outputs while another critiques them, fostering collaborative improvement. For instance, in legal research, agents can iteratively refine responses by re-evaluating retrieved case law, ensuring accuracy and comprehensiveness.
