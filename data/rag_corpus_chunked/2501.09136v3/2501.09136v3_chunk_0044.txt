By leveraging 33 agentic intelligence, these systems introduce capabilities such as dynamic decision-making, iterative reasoning, and collaborative workflows, enabling them to tackle complex, real-world tasks with enhanced precision and adaptability. This survey explored the evolution of RAG systems, from their initial implementations to advanced paradigms like Modular RAG, highlighting the contributions and limitations of each. The integration of agents into the RAG pipeline has emerged as a pivotal development, resulting in Agentic RAG systems that overcome static workflows and limited contextual adaptability. Applications across healthcare, finance, education, and creative industries demonstrate the transformative potential of these systems,
