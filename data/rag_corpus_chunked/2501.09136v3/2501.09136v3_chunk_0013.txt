External tools, such as unit tests or web searches, can further enhance this process by validating results and highlighting gaps. In multi-agent systems, Reflection can involve distinct roles, such as one agent generating outputs while another critiques them, fostering collaborative improvement. For instance, in legal research, agents can iteratively refine responses by re-evaluating retrieved case law, ensuring accuracy and comprehensiveness. Reflection has demonstrated significant performance improvements in studies like Self-Refine [27], Reflexion [28], and CRITIC [23]. Figure 8: An Overview of Agentic Self- Reflection 3.2 Planning Planning [24] is a key design pattern in agentic workflows that enables agents to autonomously decompose complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks. This capability is essential for multi-hop reasoning and iterative problem-solving in dynamic and uncertain scenarios as shown in Figure 9a. By leveraging planning, agents can dynamically determine the sequence of steps needed to accomplish a larger objective. This adaptability allows agents to handle tasks that cannot be predefined, ensuring flexibility in decision-making. While powerful, Planning can produce less predictable outcomes compared to deterministic workflows like Reflection. Planning is particularly suited for tasks that require dynamic adaptation, where predefined workflows are insufficient. As the technology matures, its potential to drive innovative applications across domains will continue to grow. 3.3 Tool Use Tool Use enables agents to extend their capabilities by interacting with external tools, APIs, or computational resources as illustrated in 9b. This pattern allows agents to gather information, perform computations, and manipulate data beyond their pre-trained knowledge. By dynamically integrating tools into workflows, agents can adapt to complex tasks and provide more accurate and contextually relevant outputs. Modern agentic workflows incorporate tool use for a variety of applications, including information retrieval, computa- tional reasoning, and interfacing with external systems. The implementation of this pattern has evolved significantly with advancements like GPT-4’s function
