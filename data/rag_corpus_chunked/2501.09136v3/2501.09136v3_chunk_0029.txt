the order database. • Fetches real-time status updates from the shipping provider API. • Conducts a web search for external factors such as weather conditions or local disruptions. 4. Response Synthesis: • The LLM integrates all retrieved information, synthesizing a comprehensive and actionable response. Response: Integrated Response: “Your package is delayed due to severe weather conditions in your region. It is currently at the local distribution center and will be delivered in 2 days. Alternatively, you may opt for a local pickup from the facility.” 5.6 Graph-Based Agentic RAG 5.6.1 Agent-G: Agentic Framework for Graph RAG Agent-G [8]: introduces a novel agentic architecture that integrates graph knowledge bases with unstructured document retrieval. By combining structured and unstructured data sources, this framework enhances retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems with improved reasoning and retrieval accuracy. It employs modular retriever banks, dynamic agent interaction, and feedback loops to ensure high-quality outputs as shown in Figure 21. Figure 21: An Overview of Agent-G: Agentic Framework for Graph RAG [8] 23 Key Idea of Agent-G The core principle of Agent-G lies in its ability to dynamically assign retrieval tasks to specialized agents, leveraging both graph knowledge bases and textual documents. Agent-G adjusts its retrieval strategy as follows: • Graph Knowledge Bases: Structured data is used to extract relationships, hierarchies, and connections (e.g., disease-to-symptom mappings in healthcare). • Unstructured Documents: Traditional text retrieval systems provide contextual information to complement graph data. • Critic Module: Evaluates the relevance and quality of retrieved information, ensuring alignment with the query. • Feedback Loops: Refines retrieval and synthesis through iterative validation and re-querying. Workflow: The Agent-G system is built on four primary components: 1. Retriever Bank: • A modular set of agents specializes in retrieving graph-based or unstructured data. • Agents dynamically select relevant sources based on the query’s requirements. 2.
