with its own memory and workflow, which can include the use of tools, reflection, or planning, enabling dynamic and collaborative problem-solving (see Figure 10). While multi-agent collaboration offers significant potential, it is a less predictable design pattern compared to more mature workflows like Reflection and Tool Use. Nevertheless, emerging frameworks such as AutoGen, Crew AI, and LangGraph are providing new avenues for implementing effective multi-agent solutions. Figure 10: An Overview of MultiAgent These design patterns form the foundation for the success of Agentic RAG systems. By structuring workflows—from simple, sequential steps to more adaptive, collaborative processes—these patterns enable systems to dynamically adapt their retrieval and generative strategies to the diverse and ever-changing demands of real-world environments. Leveraging these patterns, agents are capable of handling iterative, context-aware tasks that significantly exceed the capabilities of traditional RAG systems. 4 Agentic Workflow Patterns: Adaptive Strategies for Dynamic Collaboration Agentic workflow patterns, [12, 13] structure LLM-based applications to optimize performance, accuracy, and efficiency. Different approaches are suitable depending on task complexity and processing requirements. 11 4.1 Prompt Chaining: Enhancing Accuracy Through Sequential Processing Prompt chaining [12, 13] decomposes a complex task into multiple steps, where each step builds upon the previous one. This structured approach improves accuracy by simplifying each subtask before moving forward. However, it may increase latency due to sequential processing. Figure 11: Illustration of Prompt Chaining Workflow When to Use: This workflow is most effective when a task can be broken down into fixed subtasks, each contributing to the final output. It is particularly useful in scenarios where step-by-step reasoning enhances accuracy. Example Applications: • Generating marketing content in one language and then translating it into another while preserving nuances. • Structuring document creation by first generating an outline, verifying its completeness, and then developing the full text. 4.2 Routing:Directing Inputs
