as invoice number, date, vendor information, line items, and payment terms. 2. Retrieve the corresponding vendor contract to verify payment terms and identify any applicable discounts or compliance requirements. 3. Generate a payment recommendation report that includes original amount due, potential early payment discounts, budget impact analysis, and strategic payment actions. Response: Integrated Response: "Invoice INV-2025-045 for $15,000.00 has been processed. An early payment discount of 2% is available if paid by 2025-04-10, reducing the amount due to $14,700.00. A bulk order discount of 5% was applied as the subtotal exceeded $10,000.00. It is recommended to approve early payment to save 2% and ensure timely fund allocation for upcoming project phases." Key Features and Advantages • State Maintenance: Tracks document context and workflow stage, ensuring consistency across processes. • Multi-Step Orchestration: Handles complex workflows involving multiple components and external tools. • Domain-Specific Intelligence: Applies tailored business rules and guidelines for precise recommendations. • Scalability: Supports large-scale document processing with modular and dynamic agent integration. • Enhanced Productivity: Automates repetitive tasks while augmenting human expertise in decision-making. 28 6 Comparative Analysis of Agentic RAG Frameworks Table 2 provides a comprehensive comparative analysis of the three architectural frameworks: Traditional RAG, Agentic RAG, and Agentic Document Workflows (ADW). This analysis highlights their respective strengths, weaknesses, and best-fit scenarios, offering valuable insights into their applicability across diverse use cases.
