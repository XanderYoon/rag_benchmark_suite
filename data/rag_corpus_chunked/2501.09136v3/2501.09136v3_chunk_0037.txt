transformative potential across a variety of domains. By combining real-time data retrieval, generative capabilities, and autonomous decision-making, these systems address complex, dynamic, and multi-modal challenges. This section explores the key applications of Agentic RAG, providing detailed insights into how these systems are shaping industries such as customer support, healthcare, finance, education, legal workflows, and creative industries. 7.1 Customer Support and Virtual Assistants Agentic RAG systems are revolutionizing customer support by enabling real-time, context-aware query resolution. Traditional chatbots and virtual assistants often rely on static knowledge bases, leading to generic or outdated responses. 29 By contrast, Agentic RAG systems dynamically retrieve the most relevant information, adapt to the user’s context, and generate personalized responses. Use Case: Twitch Ad Sales Enhancement [37] For instance, Twitch leveraged an agentic workflow with RAG on Amazon Bedrock to streamline ad sales. The system dynamically retrieved advertiser data, historical campaign performance, and audience demographics to generate detailed ad proposals, significantly boosting operational efficiency. Key Benefits: • Improved Response Quality: Personalized and context-aware replies enhance user engagement. • Operational Efficiency: Reduces the workload on human support agents by automating complex queries. • Real-Time Adaptability: Dynamically integrates evolving data, such as live service outages or pricing updates. 7.2 Healthcare and Personalized Medicine In healthcare, the integration of patient-specific data with the latest medical research is critical for informed decision- making. Agentic RAG systems enable this by retrieving real-time clinical guidelines, medical literature, and patient history to assist clinicians in diagnostics and treatment planning. Use Case: Patient Case Summary [38] Agentic RAG systems have been applied in generating patient case summaries. For example, by integrating electronic health records (EHR) and up-to-date medical literature, the system generates comprehensive summaries for clinicians to make faster and more informed decisions. Key Benefits: • Personalized Care: Tailors recommendations to individual patient needs. •
