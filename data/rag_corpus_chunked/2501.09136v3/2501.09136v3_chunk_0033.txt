retrieved information, leading to more accurate and contextually appropriate responses. • Scalability: The modular nature of the agent framework allows for the integration of additional retrieval strategies and data sources as needed. 26 Use Case: Multi-Hop Question Answering Prompt: Which author influenced the mentor of J.K. Rowling? System Process (GeAR Workflow): 1. Top-Tier Agent: Evaluates the query’s multi-hop nature and determines that a combination of graph expansion and document retrieval is necessary to answer the question. 2. Graph Expansion Module: • Identifies that J.K. Rowling’s mentor is a key entity in the query. • Traces the literary influences on that mentor by exploring graph-structured data on literary relationships. 3. Agent-Based Retrieval: • An agent autonomously selects the graph-expanded retrieval path to gather relevant information about the mentor’s influences. • Integrates additional context by querying textual data sources for unstructured details about the mentor and their influences. 4. Response Synthesis: Combines insights from the graph and document retrieval processes using the LLM to generate a response that accurately reflects the complex relationships in the query. Response: Integrated Response: “J.K. Rowling’s mentor, [Mentor Name], was heavily influenced by [Author Name], known for their [notable works or genre]. This connection highlights the layered relationships in literary history, where influential ideas often pass through multiple generations of authors.” 5.7 Agentic Document Workflows in Agentic RAG Agentic Document Workflows (ADW)[36] extend traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigms by enabling end-to-end knowledge work automation. These workflows orchestrate complex document-centric processes, integrating document parsing, retrieval, reasoning, and structured outputs with intelligent agents (see Figure 23). ADW systems address limitations of Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) and RAG by maintaining state, coordinating multi-step workflows, and applying domain-specific logic to documents. Workflow 1. Document Parsing and Information Structuring: • Documents are parsed using enterprise-grade tools (e.g., LlamaParse) to extract relevant data
