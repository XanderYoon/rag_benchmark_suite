for implementing Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows. • IBM Watson and Agentic RAG:IBM’s watsonx.ai [54] supports building Agentic RAG systems, exemplified by using the Granite-3-8B-Instruct model to answer complex queries by integrating external information and enhancing response accuracy. • Neo4j and Vector Databases: Neo4j, a prominent open-source graph database, excels in handling complex relationships and semantic queries. Alongside Neo4j, vector databases like Weaviate, Pinecone, Milvus, and Qdrant provide efficient similarity search and retrieval capabilities, forming the backbone of high-performance Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows. 9 Benchmarks and Datasets Current benchmarks and datasets provide valuable insights into evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, including those with agentic and graph-based enhancements. While some are explicitly designed for RAG, others are adapted to test retrieval, reasoning, and generation capabilities in diverse scenarios. Datasets are crucial for testing the retrieval, reasoning, and generation components of RAG systems. Table 3 discusses some key datasets based on the dowstream task for RAG Evaluation. Benchmarks play a critical role in standardizing the evaluation of RAG systems by providing structured tasks and metrics. The following benchmarks are particularly relevant: • BEIR (Benchmarking Information Retrieval): A versatile benchmark designed for evaluating embedding models on a variety of information retrieval tasks, encompassing 17 datasets across diverse domains like bioinformatics, finance, and question answering [55]. • MS MARCO (Microsoft Machine Reading Comprehension): Focused on passage ranking and question answering, this benchmark is widely used for dense retrieval tasks in RAG systems [56]. • TREC (Text REtrieval Conference, Deep Learning Track):Provides datasets for passage and document retrieval, emphasizing the quality of ranking models in retrieval pipelines [57]. • MuSiQue (Multihop Sequential Questioning): A benchmark for multihop reasoning across multiple documents, emphasizing the importance of retrieving and synthesizing information from disconnected contexts [58]. • 2WikiMultihopQA: A dataset designed for multihop QA tasks over two
