excerpt and focusing on the important information that should be embedded. In [2] we conducted a series of quantitative and qualita- tive experiments on synthesised piano music data, with the results indicating that the attention mechanism is capable of increasing the robustness of the audio–sheet music retrieval system. Table 1 summarises the main experimental results for a snippet-wise retrieval scenario: given an audio frag- Figure 1. (a) Illustration of the retrieval application.

We compare the baseline network BL1 from [8] with an upgraded version BL2 of it (which replaces the last global pooling layer of each modality path- way with a dense layer) and check for retrieval improve- ments when adding the attention mechanism (+AT) and in- creasing the duration of the audio excerpts from a short con- text (SC, 2.1 sec) to a long context (LC, 8.4 sec). No improvement is at first observed when only expand- ing the temporal context of the second baseline (from BL2- SC to BL2-LC). However, when appending the attention mechanism to BL2, we notice a boost in retrieval perfor- mance, with the MRR increasing from 0.63 to 0.75. When comparing the main baseline BL1-SC with our best model configuration, we observe a substantial
