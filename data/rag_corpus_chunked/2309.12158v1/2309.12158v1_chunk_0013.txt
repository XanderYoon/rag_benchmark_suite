is that it completely ignores the temporal relationships be- tween subsequent snippet queries, which are inherent in, and constitutive of, music. In [5], a matching strategy is presented that aligns the sequences of embeddings obtained from the query document and search database items. The sequence of embedded snippets {yi 1, yi 2, ..., yi Mi } of each piece Di ∈ D from the database is aligned to the query se- quence {x1, x2, ..., xN } via dynamic time warping (DTW), using the cosine distance as a cost function. The DTW alignment cost between query Q and piece Di is regarded as the matching cost ci = DTW( Q, Di). Then a ranked list is computed based on the matching cost of each piece to the query, with the best matching piece having the lowest alignment cost. Experiments with real and noisy music data reported in [5] reveal that using the proposed DTW-based match- ing strategy improves identification results by a large mar- gin, when comparing with the simple vote-based approach. However a number of additional shortcomings of this pro- posed matching strategy arise: first, even though there are fast implementations of the DTW algorithm, the retrieval time scales up considerably as the search database grows. Moreover, DTW does not handle typical structural differ- ences between audio performances and scores, caused by, e.g., repeats that are, or are not, played. Therefore we be- lieve the next steps in this direction should target algorithms that can scale to large music collections, in terms of pro- cessing time, and that are flexible and robust in dealing with structural mismatches between audio and sheet music. 3. Remaining Challenges In this section, we briefly discuss the remaining obstacles and open problems, and identify promising directions for future research. 3.1 Public large-scale datasets Large
