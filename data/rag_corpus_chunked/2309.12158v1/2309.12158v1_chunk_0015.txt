real- time feedback and iterative refinement. A potential direction is to use compact cross-modal fin- gerprints, which allow fast search in music as in [1, 14]. Moreover such algorithms should be flexible to handle any kind of structural mismatch between an audio performance and a printed score, as discussed in Subsection 2.4. 3.3 Instrumentation and genre Incorporating diverse instrumentation and genres in audio-sheet music retrieval research enables the develop- ment of more inclusive, adaptable, and effective retrieval methods that align with real-world scenarios and user ex- pectations. It broadens the scope of the field and promotes advancements that cater to the diverse musical landscape found in big and heterogeneous music collections. Most retrieval methods use classical piano music as a case study since this type of data is easier to collect due to its abundance and popularity. Complex types of scores, such as orchestral and jazz music, will required more sophisticated and flexible methods, which could be assisted for example by optical music recognition [3]. 4. Conclusion This article examined the current developments in audio- sheet music retrieval via deep learning methods. We have identified the main obstacles on the road towards robust and large-scale retrieval and have discussed the steps taken to address some of these challenges. While there has been steady progress in the field over the past years, there are still open problems that hinder the large-scale employment of this methodology. To assist the progress towards a unified and robust re- trieval methodology for cross-modal music retrieval, we be- lieve it is crucial to address these remaining challenges, this way unlocking new possibilities for connecting large and heterogeneous music collections and contribute to the en- richment of music information retrieval applications.
