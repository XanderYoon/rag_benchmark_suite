eration quality was measured using Exact Match (EM) and F1-score (F1). 5.3 Classifier To dynamically predict the number of passages (k) to retrieve per query, we fine-tuned a RoBERTa model on the training collection of all three datasets. The classifier was trained as a multi-class task, where the input is a question and the target is its annotated hop type: 2-hop, 3-hop, or 4-hop. The output class is then mapped to a correspondingkvalue for retrieval. The classifier was evaluated on all three datasets, and was evaluated to be 87.3% accurate using exact match. An alternate classifier was trained using only the MuSiQue dataset, to evaluate if the performance is affected significantly when trained on three different datasets. The classfier trained on MuSiQue only scored a 77.8% accuracy on MuSiQue queries, while the classifier trained on all three datasets scored 76.5%, which does not indicate a substantial loss in performance. – Modelarchitecture:Weusedtheroberta-basemodelfromHuggingFace, with a classification head on top. – Input:Natural language question. 6. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 9 – Output:A categorical label indicating the number of reasoning hops re- quired. Training Configuration:The model was fine-tuned for 5 epochs using the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of2×10 −5 and linear learning rate scheduling. In order to address class imbalance in the hop type distribution, which is severely skewed in the favor of 2-hop questions, we implemented a WeightedRandomSamplerthat assigns inverse frequency weights to each class during training. The dataset was split into 70% training, 15% validation, and 15%testsetsusingstratifiedsamplingtomaintainclassproportionsacrosssplits. Training was conducted with a batch size of 16, and the best model was selected based on validation accuracy. 5.4 LLM Reranker For the document selection component, we employed Mistral Nemo Instruct (12.2Bparameters)withzero-shotprompting.Thepromptingstrategyinstructed the model to: (1) Analyze the given query and retrieved passages, (2) select ex- actlykpassages (predicted by the classifier) based on
