classifier is ideal. The result is shown in the Ideal Classifier row, using the dense retrieval method, compared the the Baseline. The retrieval results (not listed in the paper) show that while precision scores were 10 M. Iratni et al.

The results show a p-value of <0.01 for all three datasets. increased with the classifier-k retrieval, the recall significantly decreases. This means that while the approach may be reducing the number of distractor docu- ments, it cuts-off relevant contexts, which decreases generation performance. If a relevant context is found
