the BGE retriever and Baseline pipeline configuration using a paired t-test. The results show a p-value of <0.01 for all three datasets. increased with the classifier-k retrieval, the recall significantly decreases. This means that while the approach may be reducing the number of distractor docu- ments, it cuts-off relevant contexts, which decreases generation performance. If a relevant context is found in lower positions, but only the top two contexts are selected, that relevant context is lost. Thus, the issue likely stems from retrieval quality rather than the classifier, highlighting the need for a stronger reranker. 6. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 11 6.2 Oracle Study Ideal RetrieverThe previous experiment raises the question, if the retrieval module is ideal, will the classifier improve the generation performance? This section simulates an ideal retriever. This means that in the case of the baseline, the fixed-k retrieved contexts will contain all relevant contexts. However, this means that it will also include extra distractor passages. For example, a 2-hop question would have five retrieved contexts, two of which are relevant, and three of which are distractors. In the classifier pipeline, the classifier determines thek. However, the classifier is not guaranteed to be accurate each time. For example, it could incorrectly label a 3-hop query as 4-hop, wherein all three relevant documents are retrieved, as well as one distractor document. Although, if the classifier mislabels a 3-hop question as 2-hop, only two relevant contexts are be retrieved, and one would be missing. This experiment was conducted four times with the baseline pipeline with varying fixed-k values. The experiment was also conducted with the classifier-k, and with the ideal k value. Table 4 shows the results of this experiment. The best performing setup is with the ideal k, followed by the classifier-k. This shows that with an ideal retriever,
