We examined how three factors influence the answer quality : (i) the omission of gold supporting passages, (ii) the inclusion of distractor documents, and (iii) the position of relevant context in the input sequence.

The Impact of Context and DistractorsThe objective of this section is to assess the generation quality of a RAG system under varying levels of supporting context, using the MuSiQue train set. We first isolated 2-hop, 3-hop, and 4-hop questions for separate evaluation. For each case generation performance was iteratively measured by providing the generator with the query alongside: no relevant context, then one, two, three, and four relevant passages iteratively. 4. PROPOSED APPROACH 5 The goal is to demonstrate how generation quality scales with the amount of relevant contexts provided. In addition, we conducted two further iterations on which each query was pro- vided with all its relevant context, followed by adding one, then two distractor passages. The main goal was to simulate retrieval noise, and evaluate the ex- tent to which distractors degrade generation quality. The results confirm a clear positive correlation between the number of relevant documents and generation quality, but also highlight the destructive impact of distractors. Figure 1 depicts this finding. The results show that distractors cause a significant drop in
