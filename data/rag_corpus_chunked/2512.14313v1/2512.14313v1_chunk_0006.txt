distractor passages. The main goal was to simulate retrieval noise, and evaluate the ex- tent to which distractors degrade generation quality. The results confirm a clear positive correlation between the number of relevant documents and generation quality, but also highlight the destructive impact of distractors. Figure 1 depicts this finding. The results show that distractors cause a significant drop in per- formance, with a compounding effect as additional distractors are introduced. This is specifically true in the case of 2-hop questions, where a single distrac- tor dropped the performance by more than 26%. While both 3-hop, and 4-hop queries proved to be more resilient to distractor passages (with a 13.5% drop for 3-hop, and a 14.4% drop for 4-hop with a single distractor.), they still ex- perienced a deterioration in generation quality, with a sharper drop when two distractors are added. Context PositioningThis section examines the effect of the position of rele- vant passages on generation quality. For each query (2-hop, 3-hop, and 4-hop), we retrieved 5 passages, including distractors and relevant passages. The posi- tions varied according to three configurations: relevant passages placed at the beginning, placed in the middle, placed at the end of the sequence. As shown in Table 2, placing relevant passages at the end led to the best performance, while placing them in the middle resulted in the lowest generation quality, supporting the ’lost in the middle’ phenomenon. These results are consistent with known input position biases in LLMs, which tend to prioritize information appearing at the extremities of the input. The end-position advantage suggests models pri- oritize more recent content. These findings highlight the importance of context placement in RAG systems. When input space is limited or distractors exist, placing relevant content near the end improves generation. Table 2: Relevant context position Beginning Middle
