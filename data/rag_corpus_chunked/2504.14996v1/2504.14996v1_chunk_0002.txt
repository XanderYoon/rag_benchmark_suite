2 Jacobsen et al. Contemporary remote work and teleoperation scenarios ofte n exhibit distributed cognition, where cognitive pro- cesses are shared across human operators and tools in the env ironment [10], and now also AI systems. At the same time, team cognition, described as shared knowledge, menta l models and information processing for team coordina- tion, emerges as a critical factor. Put diﬀerently, a team’s collective cognitive state is not just the sum of individual s, but a product of communication and coordination that yields a shared understanding of tasks and situations [2, 32]. However, introducing AI into these teams in remote operatio ns also creates challenges. Prior work has, for exam- ple,identiﬁed risks of cognitive overload, as humans must m anage complex AI-driven information and alerts, and loss of situational awareness when automation handles tasks out -of-sight [23]. In turn, team dynamics can suﬀer when AI agents act without (eﬀectively) communicating their int entions, human teammates may consequently struggle to maintain common ground, leading to worsened coordination [ 18]. These challenges call for reimagining cognitive support systems with solutions that not only integrate AI in to augmented workﬂows but also actively protect human situational awareness and team cohesion, transforming rem ote operations into environments where technology and human expertise work in unison. In this paper, we highlight the impact of AI integration in re mote operations and the challenges it presents to distributed cognition among operators and team cognition i n human-AI collaboration. Grounded in the theories of distributed and team cognition, we identify three key areas of concern that arise in AI-supported remote operations: (1) reconﬁguring team cognition in human-AI teams, (2) adaptin g AI memory to align with human distributed cognition, and (3) leveraging AI as a fallback operator during communic ation disruptions.
