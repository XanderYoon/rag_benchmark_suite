an d AI can jointly build, reﬁne, and adapt a shared oper- ational history. For instance, in intelligent ports, AI cou ld maintain a dynamic knowledge graph of past disruptions, interventions, and operator adjustments, allowing humans to annotate, revise, or tag information for future AI refer- ence. 3.3 AI as a Fallback Operator Remote operations are highly dependent on stable digital in frastructure to maintain coordination between human teams and AI-driven systems [19]. However, network failures, cyberattacks, extreme weather conditions, or unforeseen technical malfunctions can disrupt real-time communicati on, leaving remote operators unable to intervene in critica l situations [8, 11]. Many AI systems have an assistive nature , meaning they either halt operations, wait for human re- engagement, or rigidly follow pre-programmed protocols wh en a disruption occurs. This creates a major operational risk as when communication is lost—who or what ensures conti nuity? In high-stakes remote environments, a lack of adaptable AI agency can lead to cascading failures, as AI remains passive in moments when rapid, autonomous decision- making is required. How to design AI that can temporarily ass ume responsibility, ensuring operational continuity during communication disruptions while facilitating a smo oth transition back to human control once connectivity is restored is therefore a timely challenge. Intelligent ports highlight this challenge, as they rely onAI-driven logistics systems to manage vessel docking, cargo handling, and supply chain synchronisation. These ports de pend on a complex web of interconnected intelligent sys- tems and remote human oversight, making them vulnerable to f ailures in networked coordination. Imagine a scenario where multiple container ships are en route to an intelligen t port when a connectivity failure isolates the port’s AI from remote human supervisors. If AI lacks fallback autonom y, it may either pause vessel docking, causing congestion and fuel waste, or
