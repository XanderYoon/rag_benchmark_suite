continues priorit ising a crane based on its past reliability without factorin g in recent wear-and-tear or maintenance logs, it may misalloca te resources, leading to delays and ineﬃciencies. Without a mechanism for adaptive forgetting [16, 33], AI systems ris k overwhelming remote human operators with excessive alerts, unwarranted recommendations, or constraints that no longer reﬂect the current reality in the remote operations. To address this, HCI research must approach AI memory as inte ractive, adaptive, and explainable. First, it can be diﬃcult for human operators to understand why AI retrieves certain information or how past decisions shape future recommendations. Future collaborative tools could provide interactive interfaces for the AI’s memory, where users can view, query, edit, or even challenge AI’s rec all [30]. Second, unlike humans, who naturally ﬁlter and forget infor mation based on relevance, AI needs explicit mecha- nisms to prioritise what should be retained versus discarde d. HCI research should investigate adaptive mechanisms, where AI dynamically de-prioritise, delays, or removes information based on operational context and human feedback. For instance, could remote operators receive “forgetting suggestions” from the AI, prompting them to decide whether certain past rules or patterns should still inﬂuence future actions?

Research should explore human-AI collaborative memory spaces, where both human operators an d AI can jointly build, reﬁne, and adapt a shared oper- ational history. For instance, in intelligent ports, AI cou ld maintain a dynamic knowledge graph of past disruptions, interventions, and operator adjustments, allowing humans to annotate, revise, or tag information for future AI refer- ence. 3.3 AI as a Fallback Operator Remote operations are highly dependent on stable
