negotiation with human operators— adapting its plan based on the operators’ expertise and real -time situational awareness. 3.2 Adapting AI Memory Remote operations generate vast amounts of data, requiring teams to ﬁlter, prioritise, and adapt information to chang- ing circumstances [4, 33] ( e.g., adaptive forgetting). Unlike humans, who naturally forge t irrelevant details and adjust their focus based on context, AI systems typically retain da ta, potentially treating pieces of information as impor- tant [16] ( e.g., catastrophic remembering). While comprehensive memory m ay seem advantageous, it can lead to cognitive overload for human operators, outdated decision -making, and ineﬃciencies when AI retrieves or acts on obsolete information. In dynamic environments where remot e operators must respond quickly to evolving conditions, AI’s inability to “forget” can become a liability rather tha n a strength. The challenge, therefore, is not just about mem - ory storage but about how AI dynamically adapts what it remem bers, forgets, and prioritises to maintain eﬀective collaboration in remote teams. Intelligent ports exemplify this issue, as they rely on AI-d riven monitoring and coordination to optimise logistics, equipment usage, and vessel movements. Over time, these AI s ystems accumulate extensive records of ship docking schedules, crane assignments, and cargo movements [29]. Wh ile historical data is valuable for trend analysis and predictive maintenance, this kind of rigid memory retention can also create ineﬃciencies in real-time decision-makin g. For instance, if an intelligent port’s AI continues priorit ising a crane based on its past reliability without factorin g in recent wear-and-tear or maintenance logs, it may misalloca te resources, leading to delays and ineﬃciencies. Without a mechanism for adaptive forgetting [16, 33], AI systems ris k overwhelming remote human operators with excessive alerts, unwarranted recommendations, or constraints that no longer reﬂect the current reality in
