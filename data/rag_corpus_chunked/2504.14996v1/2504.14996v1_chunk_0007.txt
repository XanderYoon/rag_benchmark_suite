human supervision and semi-autonomous AI decision- making [3]. When congestion occurs ( e.g., multiple vessels arriving simultaneously due to weather- related delays) various subsystems must collaboratively adjust docking sc hedules, reroute ships, and allocate resources. However, if these agents operate as isolated decision-makers withou t a shared interaction framework, human operators may struggle to maintain awareness of AI-driven decisions or to intervene eﬀectively when adjustments are needed [15]. Manuscript submitted to ACM 4 Jacobsen et al. Without clear communication mechanisms between AI and huma n supervisors, operators may be forced to override AI decisions based on incomplete understanding. To address this, HCI research must rethink how human-AI teams establish and maintain cognitive alignment. First, research should explore how AI can develop a communic ative presence, not just through status updates, but through proactive engagement, feedback requests, and real -time collaborative problem-solving. This could involve A I using conversational interfaces, ambient notiﬁcations, o r even spatialised audio cues (as envisioned in homes [14]) t o provide reasoning in an unobtrusive yet eﬀective way. Second, current AI explainability research often focuses on post-hoc justiﬁcations, where AI explains why it made a decision after the fact. However, in remote operations, hum an operators should not only interpret AI’s past decisions but also be aware and potentially negotiate its future ones. We envision that instead of AI simply assigning a docking schedule in an intelligent port, it could engage in a lightwe ight, constraint-based negotiation with human operators— adapting its plan based on the operators’ expertise and real -time situational awareness. 3.2 Adapting AI Memory Remote operations generate vast amounts of data, requiring teams to ﬁlter, prioritise, and adapt information to chang- ing circumstances [4, 33] ( e.g., adaptive forgetting). Unlike humans, who naturally forge t irrelevant details and adjust their focus based on
