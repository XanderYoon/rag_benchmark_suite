r to accomplish goals, such as steering a ship or ﬂying an aircraft [13]. DC highlights three core aspects of distribu ted information processing: how knowledge is represented and shared, how communication occurs as an activity unfolds , and how coordination is achieved across distributed units [22]. For example, in Hutchins’ [12] analysis of ship n avigation, he describes how one worker records positional information in a logbook, which is then interpreted by a team member who recalibrates the navigational tools ac- cordingly. The coordination of these individual contribut ions allows the system as a whole to function eﬀectively. By framing cognition as a socio-technical process embedded in dynamic interactions, DC provides a lens to analyse how individuals, teams, and artifacts collectively solve comp lex problems. In collaborative environments, a term often used is team cog nition [21], which examines how groups of individ- uals collaboratively manage and process information to ach ieve shared objectives [20]. Teams operating in dynamic, Manuscript submitted to ACM Distributed Cognition for AI-supported Remote Operations : Challenges and Research Directions 3 high-stakes settings, such as emergency response, aviatio n, or remote operations, rely on eﬀective information ﬂow, coordination, and shared mental models to function eﬃcient ly [6, 20]. A key concept in team cognition is implicit coordination, where team members anticipate each other’s n eeds and actions without the need for explicit communi- cation [20, 26]. This anticipation reduces communication o verhead, allowing team members to focus on task execu- tion rather than constantly negotiating roles and responsi bilities [20]. Implicit coordination is particularly bene ﬁcial in time-sensitive environments, where excessive communic ation can increase cognitive load and slow down decision- making [20]. Shared mental models play a crucial role in this process by enabling team members to develop a mutual understanding of both their
