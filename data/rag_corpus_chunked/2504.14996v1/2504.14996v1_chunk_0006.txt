AI in remote operations. For both distributed cognition and team cognition, AI (with varying levels of autonomy) will aﬀect how individuals and teams make decisions, how memory distributed across mul tiple entities may inﬂuence operations, as well as how decisions made during fallouts of communication can aﬀect t he distributed cognition. Using intelligent ports as a case study, the following sections explore key HCI challenges an d research directions for designing AI that integrates into both individual and team-based decision making. 3.1 Reconfiguring Human-AI Team Cognition Remote operations rely on distributed cognition, where hum an teams coordinate across distances using digital com- munication tools [34, 35], automated systems [36], and AI-s upported decision making [17]. Traditionally, AI has been treated as a tool that aids human decision-making, optimisi ng processes under human supervision. However, as re- mote operations become increasingly complex, AI is beginni ng to act as a more autonomous agent, making decisions in environments where immediate human oversight is not alwa ys feasible. This challenges traditional models of team cognition, which assume that humans are the primary agents responsible for coordination and decision making. When AI systems operate independently in remote environments, n ew interactional challenges emerge. Intelligent ports exemplify these challenges, as they rely on AI-driven scheduling and planning systems to manage vessel traﬃc, cargo logistics, and predictive maintenance [27]. Unlike traditional ports, where human operators directly oversee operations, intelligent ports function with a mix o f human supervision and semi-autonomous AI decision- making [3]. When congestion occurs ( e.g., multiple vessels arriving simultaneously due to weather- related delays) various subsystems must collaboratively adjust docking sc hedules, reroute ships, and allocate resources. However, if these agents operate as isolated decision-makers withou t a shared interaction framework, human operators may struggle to maintain awareness of AI-driven decisions or
