prompting a human operator to validate the decision once rec onnected. Third, continuing in a similar vein, once human operators re gain control, understanding what the system did in the user’s absence is critical in restoring situational awa reness. Research should investigate how AI can generate interpretable, interactive autonomy logs, where operator s can review, adjust, or override AI-driven decisions. 4 Conclusion In conclusion, integrating artiﬁcial intelligence into re mote operations is not merely a technological upgrade, it is a fundamental shift that redeﬁnes how cognitive processes ar e distributed among human operators, AI systems, and Manuscript submitted to ACM 6 Jacobsen et al. collaborative teams. Our discussion has highlighted three critical areas of concern: the need to reconﬁgure human- AI team cognition, the challenges of adapting AI memory to dy namic operational contexts, and the importance of designing AI to function as a reliable fallback operator dur ing communication disruptions. Using intelligent ports as a case study, we illustrated how these challenges manifes t in real-world settings, where the potential beneﬁts of AI-driven decision-making must be balanced against risks t o situational awareness and team coordination. Moving forward, research must focus on creating systems and interfaces that foster transparent, adaptive, and resilient human- AI collaboration. By doing so, we can harness the eﬃciency an d decision-making powers of AI while safeguarding the cognitive strengths and coordination of human teams. Ultim ately, the goal is to ensure that as AI becomes an ever- more integral part of remote operations, it enhances rather than undermines the distributed and collective intelligence that lies at the heart of eﬀective, safe, and complex operati onal practices.
