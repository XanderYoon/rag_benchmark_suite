Remote operation refers to the process of moni toring, controlling, or supervising systems, machinery, o r environments from a distance using remote user interfaces [ 7, 28], sensors, and networked communication technolo- gies [25]. These operations depend on real-time informatio n visualisation to support operators in complex decision- making scenarios. Remote operations are widely used in doma ins where direct physical presence is impractical, costly, or hazardous [1]. Examples include air traﬃc control [9], in dustrial automation [3], and critical infrastructure man- agement. While AI-driven solutions can introduce eﬃciency gains in these domains, there may also be unintended consequences. Here, an increased reliance on AI could have p rofound implications for the operators’ cognitive func- tions, for example how the operators distribute cognition f or themselves [10, 12] and how it aﬀects team cognition for operators [20]. This paper was presented at the 2025 ACM Workshop on Human-AIInteraction for Augmented Reasoning (AIREASONING-2025-01). This is the authors’ version for arXiv. Authors’ Contact Information: Rune M.

Contemporary remote work and teleoperation scenarios ofte n exhibit distributed cognition, where cognitive pro- cesses are shared across human operators and tools in the env ironment [10], and now also AI systems. At the same time, team cognition, described as shared knowledge, menta l models and information processing for team coordina- tion, emerges as a critical
