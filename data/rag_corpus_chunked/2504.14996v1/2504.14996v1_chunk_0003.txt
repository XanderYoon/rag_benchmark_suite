i n human-AI collaboration. Grounded in the theories of distributed and team cognition, we identify three key areas of concern that arise in AI-supported remote operations: (1) reconﬁguring team cognition in human-AI teams, (2) adaptin g AI memory to align with human distributed cognition, and (3) leveraging AI as a fallback operator during communic ation disruptions. For each area of concern we describe pertinent challenges that emerges. To illustrate these cha llenges in a real-world setting, we focus on intelligent por ts, demonstrating how AI-driven decision-making may aﬀect coo rdination, memory structures, and resilience in remote environments. Based on these insights, we propose concrete research directions aimed at supporting and safeguarding human reasoning in AI-augmented workﬂows, ensuring that AI enhances, rather than disrupts, cognitive processes in remote operations. 2 Related Work Distributed cognition is a theoretical framework that exte nds the traditional view of cognition beyond an individual’ s mind to include interactions between people, artifacts, an d their environment. Hutchins [12, 13] introduced this con- cept through studies of ship navigation and cockpit operati ons, arguing that cognition is distributed across multiple memory and processing units, including both human and non-h uman components. In these settings, knowledge is not stored solely within individuals but is externalised in artifacts such as maps, logbooks, and instruments, which enable coordination and decision-making [24]. This perspe ctive shifts the focus from isolated cognitive processes to a broader system of interdependent elements working togethe r to accomplish goals, such as steering a ship or ﬂying an aircraft [13]. DC highlights three core aspects of distribu ted information processing: how knowledge is represented and shared, how communication occurs as an activity unfolds , and how coordination is achieved across distributed units [22]. For example, in Hutchins’ [12] analysis of ship n avigation, he describes how
