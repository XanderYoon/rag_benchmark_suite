treatment group received the same set of questions and responses; only the warning messages differed: no warning, a standard warning (equivalent to the current industry standard “ChatGPT can make mistakes. Check important info. ”), or a tailored warning generated from the specific problems in the LLM’s output statement. We recruited a total of 18 participants and separated them into the no-warning, standard-warning, or tailored-warning groups. The quiz task was followed by a survey on users’ trust in the system and a short interview about their experience. 4 Results Accuracy of Answers. The heatmap in Figure 2 summarizing the accuracy of participants’ answers under the three warning conditions shows notable differences in performance. Participants exposed to tailored warnings demonstrated the highest accuracy across all hallucination levels, achieving 100% accuracy in responses with no hallucinations, 89% in low-level hallucination cases, and 81% in high-level hallucination cases. In contrast, participants in the standard warning group achieved 97%, 81%, and 69% accuracy for no, low, and high hallucinations, respectively. The no warning group performed the poorest, with accuracies of 100%, 64%, and 56% under the same conditions. These results demonstrates that tailored warnings substantially enhance participants’ ability to detect hallucinations, particularly in challenging scenarios involving high-level hallucinations. Statistical Significance of Results. We utilize an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test to calculate the p-value of our results. More specifically, we test for whether the differences in accuracy between the three groups (tailored, standard, and no warnings) are statistically significant, and obtained a value of 0.006162 (PR(>F)). Despite the small sample size, this strongly suggests that the results are statistically significant, and thus, the following evaluation tend to assume similar results over a large sample size.
