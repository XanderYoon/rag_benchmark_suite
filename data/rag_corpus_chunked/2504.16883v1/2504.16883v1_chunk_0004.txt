explore the optimal integration of hallucination detection mechanisms within user interfaces and evaluate their impact on users’ decision-making and trust calibration. 3 Study Our on-going research proposes a tailored warning system (figure 2), where a “fact-check” is being added at both the information retrieval and LLM output level. A warning message tailored to the specific problem is then outputted into the user’s interface when they interact with the LLM chatbot. Unlike general warning mechanisms, our approach dynamically adapts to the specific context of each question and the retrieved content, providing users with targeted alerts based on the nature and reliability of the information presented. By focusing on a warning system that both detects and communicates potential inaccuracies, we aim to create a more interactive and user-aware RAG experience that directly addresses the critical issues of hallucinations and misinformation in educational settings. We conducted a pilot study within the context of a textbook-based question-and-answer task, as history textbooks are often associated with biases. An AP US history textbook was queried into the database, and we retrieved relevant information from the database. An LLM-based question-and-answer system was developed. We divided eighteen questions into three groups of six. For each group, we prepared genuine (factually correct), low-level hallucination (subtle changes in details or biased language), and high-level hallucination responses (clearly detectable factually incorrect information). This process resulted in a questionnaire of 18 multiple-choice questions. All participants in the two control groups and the treatment group received the same set of questions and responses; only the warning messages differed: no warning, a standard warning (equivalent to the current industry standard “ChatGPT can make mistakes. Check important info. ”), or a tailored warning generated from the specific problems in the LLM’s output statement. We recruited a total of 18 participants and separated them into the
