retrieval-based limitations; they also introduce cognitive and epistemic challenges for users engaging with their outputs. Even when retrieval is accurate, biases and fairness issues can emerge at the response generation stage, where LLMs may prioritize certain documents, misinterpret retrieved facts, or be influenced by user queries. In educational contexts, retrieval-augmented content, such as historical textbooks, presents additional challenges due to the inherent biases and inaccuracies tied to publication time and location [ 9]. Consequently, RAG systems may unintentionally reinforce these biases, shaping users’ perceptions of truthfulness and affecting their ability to critically evaluate AI-generated content [16]. Given the increasing reliance on LLM-based tools for learning [11], it is imperative to design AI-augmented reasoning systems that encourage reflective engagement rather than passive acceptance of retrieved information. One promising approach to mitigating these risks is the integration of tailored warning messages that enhance users’ critical reasoning without eroding trust. Prior research on AI safety has demonstrated that well-designed warnings can help users identify hallucinated content and improve decision-making [8]. For example, Farsight provides proactive risk assessments of AI-based tools during early design stages, offering insights into potential harms before deployment [14]. While methods for detecting and debiasing LLM-generated outputs have been proposed [4] [6], these strategies often operate at the model level without providing direct, user-facing explanations of biases. Despite the progress in designing safeguards for LLMs, research on how tailored warnings influence human reasoning within RAG systems remains limited. Existing studies establish a foundation for safety in tool design and basic chatbot interactions, but little work has explored how real-time, context-specific warnings shape users’ ability to critically engage with AI-augmented content. This research aims to bridge that gap by investigating how tailored warning messages influence reasoning and trust in RAG-based educational settings, contributing to the broader goal of AI-augmented reasoning systems
