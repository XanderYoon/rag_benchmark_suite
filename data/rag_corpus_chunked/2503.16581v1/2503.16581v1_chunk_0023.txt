of 1.381, and Phi3.5:3.8b achieved 2.000, indicating frequent inconsistencies. While Phi3:3.8b scored slightly higher at 2.476, Llama3.2:3b stood out with a score of 4.619, showcas- ing exceptional faithfulness that rivaled larger models. 3) Answer Relevance: Answer relevance as shown in Fig- ure 3 assesses whether the generated responses address the query’s intent effectively. Fig. 3. Answer Relevance by the 13 LLMs. • Large Models (Red) : The Llama3.2:3b, while clas- sified as small, achieved the highest relevance score of 4.857, followed closely by Llama3:70b and Llama3.1:70b, both scoring 4.571. Gemma2:27b and QwQ:32b continued to perform well, with scores of 4.381 and 4.095, respectively. These models consis- tently delivered relevant responses aligned with the intent behind complex queries. • Medium Models (Yellow): The medium models pro- vided strong performance, particularly Gemma2:9b, which achieved 4.143. Llama3:8b followed with 3.810, and Llama3.1:8b recorded a slightly lower score of 3.238. These models addressed moderately complex queries effectively but occasionally lacked depth. • Small Models (Green) : The small models exhibited varied performance, with Llama3.2:1b scoring the lowest at 1.381. Phi3.5:3.8b and Phi3:3.8b recorded scores of 2.000 and 2.476, respectively, indicating challenges in providing fully relevant responses. How- ever, Llama3.2:3b once again stood out, achieving the highest score of 4.857, performing on par with the best large models. 4) Intercoder Agreement: We assessed intercoder agree- ment, which measures the extent to which evaluators within the same group report the same evaluation for a given instance. To www.ijacsa.thesai.org 8 | P a g e (IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, Vol. 16, No. 2, 2025 compute this metric, we examined the percentage of instances where both evaluators assigned identical evaluation scores independently. This measure enabled us to evaluate the degree of concordance between evaluators and assess their consistency in evaluation. TABLE I. T
