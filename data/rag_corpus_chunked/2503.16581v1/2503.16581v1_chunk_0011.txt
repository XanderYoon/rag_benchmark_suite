comparative approach was instrumental in iden- tifying the models’ relative strengths and limitations, thereby enabling a more thorough evaluation [26]. To verify the dependability of their judgments, evaluators returned to a subset of previously evaluated responses on a regular basis and reassessed them. This con- sistency check allowed evaluators to reflect on their scoring processes and ensure they were in line with the rating criteria. The structured evaluation guidelines guaranteed that the assessment process was meticulous, consistent, and transpar- ent. The guidelines established a comprehensive framework for assessing the system’s performance by emphasizing context relevance, answer faithfulness, and answer relevance [27]. This method enable a thorough comparison of several LLMs and provided vital insights into their performance in answering Islamic queries with contextual precision and faithfulness [15], [27]. The evaluations were submitted through the platform after all responses to a specific query were evaluated, scored, and commented on. In order to provide a comprehensive dataset for the purpose of investigating the LLMs, the platform logged and stored the data for research [28]. C. Dataset Selection and Curation The dataset used in this study was carefully selected and organized to guarantee it aligns with the goals of assess- ing large language models (LLMs) within the framework of quranic studies. The process of selection and curation included identifying a reliable source, organizing the data, and confirming its alignment with the research goals [15], [28]. 1) Selection Criteria: The dataset was chosen according to these specific criteria: • Authenticity: The source underwent a thorough review to confirm its compliance with recognized Islamic scholarship and the absence of speculative interpretations [26], [27]. • Descriptive Richness: The dataset must deliver com- prehensive, contextually rich descriptions that can be effectively employed for semantic search and response generation [27], [29]. • Clarity and Accessibility: The content needed
