The assessment analyzes the efficacy of these models when enhanced with domain-specific data through the RAG methodology. The study evaluates the models in a zero-shot context, without any fine-tuning on the unique dataset. This method emphasizes the models’ intrinsic capacity to generalize and appropriately respond by utilizing external information obtained from the descriptive dataset. 6) Integration with the RAG Framework: The selected LLMs were integrated with the RAG framework, allowing them to generate contextually relevant responses based on the dataset. The RAG framework enhances the performance of the models by providing contextual input, reducing hallucination, and facilitating citations. G. Hardware and Software Configuration The experiments were conducted using a high-performance computing system equipped with an Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 5318Y CPU operating at 2.10 GHz with 24 cores. The system featured four NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPUs, each providing 48 GB of VRAM, enabling efficient handling of computationally intensive tasks, particularly those involving deep learning models. Additionally, the system was supported by 128 GB of RAM, ensuring smooth execution of memory-intensive operations and facilitating large-scale data processing. This configuration provided the computational resources necessary to run and evaluate the models effectively. III. R ESULTS The results of this study are based on the implementation of a RAG architecture, designed to evaluate the performance of 13 LLMs in answering questions related to Quranic studies. By leveraging a descriptive dataset of Quranic surahs, the RAG system facilitates the integration of external knowledge to address the limitations of standalone models. The comparative analysis focuses on assessing the relevance, faithfulness, and contextual accuracy of the responses generated by the LLMs within this framework. A. Experimental Results The experimental evaluation assessed the capacity of a variety of large language models (LLMs) to respond to queries related to quranic studies. The models were assessed based on three critical
