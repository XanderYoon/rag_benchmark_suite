about each surah, including meaning, provenance of revelation, and historical context. Descriptive insights are essential for offering relevant and accurate answers to questions regarding quranic studies. Since Qur’an is the sacred revelation that remains intact in today’s world without any human involvement, and the Qur’an is the only source to link human beings with their creator, an attempt to identify the reliable and trustworthy LLMs is really important. As they provide useful resources for the readers, accuracy and truthfulness must be given due importance while exploring the provided information from such sources. In order to overcome the difficulties associated with hal- lucination and accuracy, we have implemented a framework known as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [11], [12], [13]. This method integrates LLM semantics with a vector database to retrieve relevant data from descriptive datasets [14], [15]. The RAG method guarantees that responses derive from authoritative sources that are contextually appropriate, thereby reducing the probability of delivering content that is unsubstantiated or irrelevant. Citations are supplied in each response, which enables users to trace the information back to the descriptive dataset. This further enhances the level of trust and transparency [16]. The objectives of this research are threefold: (1) to compare 13 open-source LLMs in terms of their ability to respond accurately and faithfully to questions about quranic studies [17], (2) to assess the effectiveness of the RAG approach in reducing hallucination and ensuring response relevance [18], and (3) to provide insights into the use of descriptive datasets for religious education and AI-based knowledge systems [19]. The evaluation criteria consist of context relevance, response faithfulness, and answer relevance, and they are evaluated using human evaluation. [14]. This study provides a robust framework for integrating LLMs with descriptive datasets, thereby contributing to the expanding field of domain-specific AI applications [20]. It emphasizes the
