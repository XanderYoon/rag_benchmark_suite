to these specific criteria: • Authenticity: The source underwent a thorough review to confirm its compliance with recognized Islamic scholarship and the absence of speculative interpretations [26], [27]. • Descriptive Richness: The dataset must deliver com- prehensive, contextually rich descriptions that can be effectively employed for semantic search and response generation [27], [29]. • Clarity and Accessibility: The content needed to be created in a structured and clear manner, facilitating both manual review and computational processing [15], [28]. • Relevance: The dataset was meticulously curated to facilitate the process of addressing inquiries related to quranic studies, emphasizing themes that are fre- quently observed in these discussions [26] 2) Curation Process: A comprehensive curation procedure was carried out on the dataset in order to get it ready for integration with the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system and LLMs: • Data Digitization: The text from the source book was digitized to generate a dataset that can be accessed by machines. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tools were employed where necessary to convert printed material into digital text [15], [28]. • Data Structuring: The content was segmented into surah name, number of verses, reason for the name, general objective, virtues, and relationships. Each field was carefully labeled to facilitate precise retrieval [27]. • Content Validation: The digitized and structured dataset was reviewed by experts in Islamic studies to verify its accuracy and alignment with the original source [26]. • Preprocessing: Unnecessary or redundant information was removed, and inconsistencies were corrected. To- kenization was performed to split the text into smaller, www.ijacsa.thesai.org 4 | P a g e (IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, Vol. 16, No. 2, 2025 manageable units for processing by the semantic search system. • Vectorization: The structured data was transformed into high-dimensional vector embeddings using pre- trained language
