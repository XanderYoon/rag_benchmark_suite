Example: ◦ Query: “Why is Surah Al-Fatihah called Umm Al-Kitab?” ◦ Relevant Response: Surah Al-Fatihah is called Umm Al-Kitab because it summarizes the central teachings of the Qur’an and is recited in every unit of prayer. ◦ Irrelevant Response: Surah Al-Fatihah has seven verses and is the first chapter of the Qur’an. The relevant response directly answers the query, providing reasoning, while the irrelevant response, though factually correct, fails to address the specific question. 3) Evaluation Process: Human evaluators assessed the system-generated responses through a web-based platform, where they were presented with prompts, the corresponding responses, and an interface for scoring. The evaluation process included the following steps: • Reviewing Responses: The process of reviewing responses was a critical step in evaluating the quality of the outputs generated by the large language mod- els (LLMs). Human evaluators carried out this task through a web-based platform specifically designed to facilitate structured and unbiased assessments. • Scoring System: For each response, evaluators as- signed scores on a Likert scale (1 to 5) for the three evaluation criteria: Context Relevance, Answer Faithfulness, and Answer Relevance. In addition to numerical scores, evaluators could provide written feedback to justify their evaluations [16]. This qualita- tive feedback emphasized specific faults or applauded features of the response, providing more insight into the system’s performance. • Reevaluation and Calibration: Since numerous replies were provided for each query, evaluators could compare the quality of outputs from various LLMs. This comparative approach was instrumental in iden- tifying the models’ relative strengths and limitations, thereby enabling a more thorough evaluation [26]. To verify the dependability of their judgments, evaluators returned to a subset of previously evaluated responses on a regular basis and reassessed them. This con- sistency check allowed evaluators to reflect on their scoring processes and ensure they were in
