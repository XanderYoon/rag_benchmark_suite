the surah, often sup- ported by hadith (sayings of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him). • Relationships: Insights into the connections between the beginning and end of the surah, or its relationship to preceding or succeeding chapters. For instance, Surah Al-Hadid (Chapter 57) is described as follows: • Number of Verses : 29. • Meaning of its Name : ”Al-Hadid” translates to ”The Iron” in Arabic. • Reason for its Name: It is the only chapter where the benefits of iron are mentioned, symbolizing strength and utility. • General Objective: Encourages the virtue of spending in the cause of Allah as an appreciation of His favors. • Virtues: Includes a hadith where the Prophet Muham- mad (peace be upon him) recommends reciting this chapter as one of three glorifications of Allah. www.ijacsa.thesai.org 2 | P a g e (IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, Vol. 16, No. 2, 2025 • Relationships: Highlights thematic continuity be- tween its verses and connections to preceding chap- ters, such as Surah Al-Waqi’ah. The dataset was preprocessed and organized into structured fields to ensure efficient retrieval and usability in the study. Key steps included: • Field Segmentation : Each descriptive element (e.g., ”virtues,” ”relationships”) was extracted and stored as a separate field for better semantic alignment with queries. • Vectorization: Text data was transformed into high- dimensional vector embeddings through the use of cutting-edge NLP models, which facilitated the search for semantic similarity [22]. • Storage in a Vector Database : The organized and scalar data was kept in a scaled vector database so that it would be easy to find the right descriptions during query processing [23],[22]. This particular dataset provides lots of information that goes beyond the actual text of the Qur’an, including contextual and interpretative details. Based on
