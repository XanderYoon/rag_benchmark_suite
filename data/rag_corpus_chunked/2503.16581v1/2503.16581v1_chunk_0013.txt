removed, and inconsistencies were corrected. To- kenization was performed to split the text into smaller, www.ijacsa.thesai.org 4 | P a g e (IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, Vol. 16, No. 2, 2025 manageable units for processing by the semantic search system. • Vectorization: The structured data was transformed into high-dimensional vector embeddings using pre- trained language models [30]. This step allowed for efficient and accurate semantic similarity searches within the dataset. • Storage in a Vector Database: The vectorized dataset was stored in a scalable and efficient vector database, enabling quick retrieval of relevant entries based on user queries [22]. 3) Dataset Integrity: To ensure the integrity and reliability of the dataset, multiple layers of validation were employed, including manual review and automated consistency checks, regular audits of the data were conducted to identify and rectify any errors or discrepancies, and a backup of the raw and processed datasets was maintained for reproducibility and future reference. 4) Strengths of the Dataset: • Richness in Context: The dataset goes beyond literal translations, providing thematic, historical, and theo- logical insights. • High Relevance: The information directly supports answering user queries about quranic studies. • Scalability: The vectorized format enables integration with modern NLP systems and future upgrades. This curated dataset ensures that the responses generated by the system are accurate, faithful, and contextually relevant, thereby serving as the foundation for the investigating and evaluation of the LLMs D. Human Evaluators In this research, human evaluators were instrumental in evaluating the responses produced by the large language models (LLMs) [31]. The evaluations were carried out using a specially designed website that focused on optimizing the evaluation process and maintaining consistency. The website offered evaluators with questions and responses from several LLMs, allowing for a systematic assessment using preset criteria
