ensuring that evaluators were not influenced by the identity of the LLM responsible for generating a response. • Scoring Interface: Evaluators rated each response based on the three evaluation criteria: ◦ Context Relevance: Precision and alignment of the response with the query. ◦ Answer Faithfulness: Accuracy of the response in relation to the retrieved dataset content. ◦ Answer Relevance: Appropriateness and direct pertinence of the response to the query. A Likert scale (1–5) was used for scoring, where 1 indicated poor performance and 5 indicated excellent performance. • Feedback Mechanism: Evaluators could provide written comments to justify their scores or highlight specific issues in the responses. This feature allowed the identification of nuanced errors that might not be captured by numerical scores alone. 3) Significance of Human Evaluations: The use of human evaluators provided an essential layer of validation for the study, ensuring that the generated responses were assessed not only for technical accuracy but also for their theological and contextual integrity [31]. By leveraging a well-structured plat- form and robust evaluation criteria, the study ensured that the investigation of LLMs was both rigorous and comprehensive, offering valuable insights into their performance in responding to Islamic queries [32]. E. Metric for Quality Evaluation This study employs Inter-Evaluator Agreement (IEA) as the primary metric to ensure the quality, reliability, and consistency of human evaluations [33]. Since human evaluators, rather than annotators, were tasked with assessing the generated responses, IEA provides a robust measure of agreement across evaluators, validating the credibility of the evaluation process and the results. IEA measures the level of consistency between evaluators when scoring responses based on predefined criteria: context relevance, answer faithfulness, and answer relevance. An el- evated IEA score signifies uniform application of evaluation criteria by assessors, whereas a diminished score reveals inconsistencies that may necessitate
