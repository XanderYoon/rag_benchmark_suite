C ONCLUSIONS This study evaluated multiple large language models (LLMs) of different sizes in responding to Quranic studies- related queries using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. The findings indicate that large mod- els, such as Llama3:70b, Llama3.1:70b, and Gemma2:27b, consistently delivered superior performance in context rele- vance, answer faithfulness, and answer relevance. However, their computational demands pose challenges for practical deployment. Medium-sized models, including Gemma2:9b and Llama3:8b, demonstrated a balance between efficiency and performance, making them suitable for moderately complex tasks. Interestingly, Llama3.2:3b, a small model, performed comparably to larger models in certain aspects, particularly in answer faithfulness and relevance, suggesting that architectural optimizations can enhance the capabilities of smaller models. The study also highlights the importance of the RAG framework in improving response quality by grounding an- swers in external domain-specific knowledge, reducing hallu- cinations, and ensuring more reliable outputs. These findings emphasize the trade-offs between model size, performance, and computational efficiency, indicating that while large models are ideal for high-accuracy tasks, smaller models, when optimized, can serve as viable alternatives. Future research can focus on further optimizations, fine-tuning strategies, and expanding dataset diversity to enhance model performance across differ- ent applications.
