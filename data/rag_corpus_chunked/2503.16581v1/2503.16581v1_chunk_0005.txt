employed in our research. We begin by analyzing the dataset, detailing its source, structure, and descriptive content. Subsequently, the system’s responsibilities are thoroughly delineated, en- compassing the formulation of solutions to user concerns concerning Islamic doctrines [21]. In addition, we provide a summary of the rules that have been set for human evaluators who are responsible for evaluating the outputs of the system. To ensure that the evaluations are reliable and consistent, we have produced these guidelines. A.
