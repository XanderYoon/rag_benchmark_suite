then text-based context will be used by an LLM to generate the response based on the query. Alternatively, the raw context may be directly fed to a MLLM to generate the response based on the query. Irrespective of the internal structure of the RAG system, the CS assesses the accuracy of each span of the generated text with the raw context which include the original set of the selected pieces. Indeed, the CS measures how correctly each part of the response reflects the information presented in the raw context. By evaluating the correctness of the text spans, we ensure that the generated responses are not only relevant but also factually accurate based on the multi-modal data. The contributions of this paper are as follows: (i) We design and train a neural network structure to find the RS between the query and each selected piece of data by RAG scheme. (ii) We perform partitioning the RAG response into spans and categorizing each span as “subjective” or “objective”. The partitioning and categorization is performed based on developing a dedicated algorithm as well as using GPT3.5 API. (iii) We design and train a neural network structure to find the CS between the raw context, i.e., the selected pieces of information from the database by RAG, and each objective span of the generated response by RAG. (iv) In addition to the original training, validation, and testing dataset used for developing CS and RS, we also build a database containing 5000 samples by gathering human feedback (HF) on the RAG selection process and the accuracy of the RAG output spans. This collected HF was then used to assess the performance of the designed RS and CS scores with human evaluation for a RAG system. (v) While CS and RS can be used to evaluate the
