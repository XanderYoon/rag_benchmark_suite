the original data is in text form, it is used as is, whereas a VLM is employed to convert any images into text descriptions. Both “selection block” and “generation block” are illustrated in Fig. 2. III. RAG-C HECK Our main objective in RAG-check is to evaluate both the selection process (i.e., how relevant the “retrieved documents” are to the query) and the generation process (i.e., which parts of the LLM response are supported by the RAG context). Note that the generation process comprises response generation and possibly text-based context generation. In particular, we introduce two quantitative measures: the relevance score (RS) and the correctness score (CS) for multi-modal RAG schemes to determine the performance of the selection and generation process, respectively. The RS provides a quantitative measure between zero (least relevant) and one (most relevant) for each retrieved piece of information. In order to assess the quality of the generated output in more details, we break down the generated response by RAG into smaller pieces, namely spans, and calculate the CS for each span. Therefore, our RAG-check model consists of three main blocks: 1) Splitting the RAG- generated response into spans and categorizing each span as either a subjective or factual statement. 2) RS model. 3) CS model. Fig. 3 shows the RAG-check model overlaid on the RAG system model. Fig. 3 also illustrates an example scenario where the query “Is beer more popular to drink with pizza or Coca-Cola?” is submitted to a RAG system, and the RAG selects the 5 most relevant images from the enterprise dataset and produces a response containing 3 statements. The RS block calculates the relevancy score for each image shown in Fig. 3. Also, the generated response is broken into 3 spans where one is “subjective” and the other two are marked with
