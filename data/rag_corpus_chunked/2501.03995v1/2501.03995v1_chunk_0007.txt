also build a database containing 5000 samples by gathering human feedback (HF) on the RAG selection process and the accuracy of the RAG output spans. This collected HF was then used to assess the performance of the designed RS and CS scores with human evaluation for a RAG system. (v) While CS and RS can be used to evaluate the reliability of an instance of the response generated by RAG, we show a different use of the tools developed in this paper by comparing the average performance of different RAG systems in terms of the relevancy of their retrieval and the correctness Fig. 2. RAG scheme structure. of their responses. II. M ULTIMODAL RAG A RAG system is composed of a database, namely, enter- prise database, which is usually pre-processed by partitioning the data into pieces and generating an embedding for each piece. The use of embeddings serves two main purposes: (i) To make a compact representation of each piece of information in order to enhance the retrieval process. (ii) To have speedy retrieval usually by using a similarity search using dot product (i.e., cosine similarity). In a multi-modal RAG, depending on the type of data, em- beddings are derived via corresponding encoders. Nonetheless, all embeddings should use the same embedding space in order to facilitate the search. In our work, we use CLIP embedding space to generate embeddings. Each image in the dataset is embedded using the CLIP vision encoder (CLIP-VE), and each piece of the text is embedded using the CLIP text encoder (CLIP-TE). The same goes for the query. Then, the cosine similarity is found between the embedding of the query and the embeddings in the vector database, irrespective of its original data type. Based on such preprocessing, a vector database is pro- duced that is composed
