is needed, the personal pronouns (such as ‘she’, ‘he’, ‘it’, and ‘they’), demonstrative pronouns (such as ‘this’ and ‘that’), progressive pronouns (such as ‘his’), etc. are replaced with the proper reference from the original text. Next, we identify whether the given span is a subjective statement or an objective statement. A subjective statement is one that may depend on human feelings, or is subject to personal viewpoints, experiences, or perspectives. Subjective statements are not scorable and are usually difficult to infer directly from the image or they are debatable. We perform an algorithm to label the subjective statements. In particular, we search for modal verbs (e.g., “could”, “might”), opinion indicators (e.g., “believe”, “feel”), hedging phrases (e.g., “it seems,”), uncertain quantifiers (e.g., “some”, “many”), adverbs of frequency and degree (e.g., “often”, “usually”), judgmental adjectives (e.g., “important”, “useful”), conjectures (e.g., “it is possible that”), and comparisons or preferences (e.g., “better”, “prefer”) in our algorithm. Note that GPT3.5 may also be used for categorization of the spans. Nonetheless, we build our system based on our custom-tailored algorithm since it had better match with human labeling of the statements as “objective” and “subjective” based on our evaluation. B. Relevance Score (RS) Model As defined RS provides a measure of relevance between the query and each piece of the raw context from the enterprise data. The relevancy in RAG systems is usually measured through cosine similarity between the embeddings. In this work, we address multi-modal RAG by focusing on the similarity between different data modalities. Specifically, we focus on text-based queries and enterprise data which consists of images. We aim to obtain the RS between the query and each of the raw context (image) from the enterprise database separately. Therefore, we design and train a model that receives an image and query as an input
