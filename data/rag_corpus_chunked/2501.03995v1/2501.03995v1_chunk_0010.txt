is submitted to a RAG system, and the RAG selects the 5 most relevant images from the enterprise dataset and produces a response containing 3 statements. The RS block calculates the relevancy score for each image shown in Fig. 3. Also, the generated response is broken into 3 spans where one is “subjective” and the other two are marked with the respective correctness score calculated by CS block. In the following, we further explain each of these three blocks of the RAG-check system. Fig. 3. Overlay of RAG-check structure on RAG block diagram. A. Partition and Categorization Depending on the type of span that we define (phrase, atomic statement, sentence, or paragraph), we split the gener- ated response of the RAG scheme into those spans. We define atomic statements as full sentences that are self-sufficient in expressing a meaning without the need to be evaluated along with another sentence or part of the original text. For example, consider the response as: “In the image, the desk is red and shiny. It is made of wood that is decorated with nice inlays.” In breaking down the second sentence in the response, the personal pronoun “It” has to be replaced with “The desk” to make this statement self-sufficient without the need to be evaluated with the first statement. We use GPT3.5 with a proper prompt to partition the response to atomic statements. The prompt is engineered in a way that whenever it is needed, the personal pronouns (such as ‘she’, ‘he’, ‘it’, and ‘they’), demonstrative pronouns (such as ‘this’ and ‘that’), progressive pronouns (such as ‘his’), etc. are replaced with the proper reference from the original text. Next, we identify whether the given span is a subjective statement or an objective statement. A subjective statement is one that may depend on human
