S. Rendle, C. Freudenthaler, Z. Gantner, L. Schmidt-Thieme, Bpr: Bayesian personalized ranking from implicit feedback, arXiv preprint arXiv:1205.2618 (2012). APPENDIX A. Prompts Template I want you to predict the user‘s rating for each movie in the candidate list on a scale from 1 to 100, based on the user’s profile and movie interaction history. Follow these instructions carefully: 1. Use the given user profile and historical movie interaction records to predict how much the user would like each movie in the candidate list. The higher the score, the more likely the user will enjoy the movie. 2. The output must be in valid JSON format, where each movie ID is paired with its predicted score. The format should be: { "movie_id1": score1, "movie_id2" : score2, ...} 3. Ensure that all movie IDs in the candidate list are included exactly once in the output. 4. Do not include any additional text, explanation, or comments outside the JSON object. ### User Profile: {user_profile_text}. ### Movie Interaction History: The user's historical movie interaction records include:{history_movies} ### Candidate List: {candidate_list} Predict and output the ratings in the required JSON format.
