list. The higher the score, the more likely the user will enjoy the movie. 2. The output must be in valid JSON format, where each movie ID is paired with its predicted score. The format should be: { "movie_id1" : score1, "movie_id2" : score2, ...} 3. Ensure that all movie IDs in the candidate list are included exactly once in the output. 4. Do not include any additional text, explanation, or comments outside the JSON object. ### Movie Interaction History: The user's historical movie interaction records include: {history_movies} ### Candidate List: {candidate_list} Predict and output the ratings in the required JSON format. This section presents the prompt templates used in our ex- periments, with distinct templates designed for the MovieLens and Netflix datasets to suit the characteristics of each dataset and the specific task requirements, as shown above. In this, {user profile text} represents a natural language sentence composed of each user’s personalized attributes, {history movies} is the list of movies the user has watched, with each movie including its title, genre, and release year, and {candidate list} is the top-K list of movies recommended to each user by traditional recommendation models. B. Algorithm Implementation Algorithm 1 CRAGRU Recommendation Unlearning Process Require: D: User interaction data, Du f : Unlearning data, I cand u : Candidate items, C: Auxiliary information, fLLM: LLM, θLLM: LLM parameters, K: Number of interactions to retain. Ensure: Recommended items ˆyu for user u. 1: Retrieval: 2: Du = Retrieve(u; D) ▷ Retrieve user u’s interaction data 3: Dfiltered u = Filter(Du, Du f ) ▷ Filter unlearning data 4: Filter Function Details: 5: Strategy 1: User Preference-based Filtering 6: C = {c1, c2, ..., cn} ▷ Define item categories 7: Calculate pu,c for each c ∈ C ▷ Interaction proportion 8: Calculate Kc = ⌊pu,c
