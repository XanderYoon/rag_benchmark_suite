candidate items, and other information. We use a template P for the prompt: P (u) = Format(Icand u , Dfiltered u , C). (10) Here, Icand u is the candidate items for user u from the basic recommendation model. Dfiltered u is the filtered user data ob- tained in Section IV-A. C is extra information for the LLM, like user profile. Format puts these things into a prompt that the LLM can understand. As shown in Appendix A.1, the prompt template P (u) is designed to incorporate essential information for the LLM to make informed recommendations. The template includes the user’s filtered interaction history (Dfiltered u ), which has been pro- cessed by our unlearning strategies to remove any unwanted information. This ensures that the LLM’s recommendations are not influenced by data that needs to be forgotten. Additionally, the template includes candidate items ( Icand u ) generated by a base recommendation model, providing a focused set of items for the LLM to consider. This will preserve the collaborative information of this user for user-level recommendation. At the same time, we can also add historical interactions of similar users in the prompt to further strengthen the collaborative information and obtain better recommendation results. We also incorporate auxiliary information ( C), such as user profiles or item metadata, to enrich the context and enable the LLM to generate more accurate and personalized recommendations. The Format function structures these elements into a coherent prompt that the LLM can effectively interpret. C. LLM-based Recommendation Generation By using the prompt P (u) constructed for each user, LLM is called to generate the result of the final recommendation. ˆyu = fLLM(P (u); θLLM), where ˆyu is the generated recommendation for user u, fLLM represents a large language model that generates text, such as Llama or
