arXiv:2511.05494v1 [cs.IR] 10 Sep 2025 often necessitate retraining nearly all sub-models, rendering these methods computationally impractical under continuous or high-volume unlearning scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose CRAGRU, a novel approach that reframes unlearning as a targeted informa- tion retrieval problem within a Retrieval-Augmented Genera- tion (RAG) architecture, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). This RAG paradigm is crucial because it allows unlearning to be primarily implemented at the retrieval stage, where specific information fed to the LLMs can be precisely filtered. This performs user-level atomic operations, isolating unlearning effects to the targeted user. CRAGRU operates through three tightly coupled stages: First, during retrieval, user interactions, profiles, and item metadata are structured as natural language prompts. This stage is paramount for unlearning, as it systematically filters out data that should be forgotten from the retrieval index, ensuring only relevant, non-forgotten information influences subsequent steps. To optimize this process for unlearning efficacy and efficiency, we introduce three novel strategies: (1) User preference-based retrieval, which selects the most representative interactions aligned with long-term user preferences (e.g., sustained genre interests); (2) Diversity-aware retrieval, balancing item diver- sity with recommendation performance; and (3) Attention- aware retrieval, which identifies high-impact user interactions based on transformer attention weights. Next, in augmentation, candidate items from traditional backbone models (e.g., Light- GCN [1]) are refined by the LLMs, fusing collaborative signals with semantic knowledge—for instance, inferring that “users who like Harry Potter also enjoy fantasy world-building” to enhance candidate relevance. Finally, during generation, the LLM synthesizes personalized recommendations solely from these augmented and meticulously filtered candidates, ensuring that the unlearning process has minimal negative impact on other related users, thereby achieving precise, debiased recom- mendation unlearning. We summarize the main contributions of this paper as follows: • To the best of our knowledge, CRAGRU is the first frame-
