ˆRui = f (u, i|Ru) that can accurately predict the rating of user u for item i. Recommendation Unlearning: In recommendation systems, the objective of recommendation unlearning is to respond to users’ withdrawal requests by eliminating the impact of specific data from the trained model. Assume user u can submit any data withdrawal request Du f ⊆ D u to remove their personal information, where Du represents all interactions of user u. We define the set of data withdrawal requests from users requiring unlearning as Df = S u∈U Du f , representing the dataset that needs to be ”forgotten”. Correspondingly, the remaining dataset is defined as Dr = D \ Df . The task of recommendation unlearning to obtain an unlearned model ˆf trained on Dr. As introduced in [44], [45], this task has the following general goals: 1) G1: Unlearning completeness. The model must com- pletely forget the deleted data, ensuring that the removal does not adversely affect the model parameters. 2) G2: Unlearning efficiency. Given the high computa- tional cost of large-scale recommender models, unlearn- ing methods must ensure time-efficient execution. 3) G3: Model Utility. The unlearned model can achieve comparable recommendation performance to models re- trained from scratch. B. Recommendation Model Our approach leverages a traditional recommendation model (e.g., matrix factorization or deep learning-based models) as the backbone to generate initial coarse-ranking scores, followed by the CRAGRU framework for unlearning and re- ranking. By decoupling the forgetting mechanism from the backbone architecture, CRAGRU enables precise removal of targeted user data (e.g., preferences or interactions) without modifying the original model parameters. CRAGRU ensures unlearning avoids costly backbone retraining while ensuring compatibility with arbitrary recommendation systems. The backbone model learns a function fb : U × I → R that predicts the preference score ˆru,i for user u
