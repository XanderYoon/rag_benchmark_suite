In the retrieval stage, the algorithm first retrieves user-related interaction data, and then applies three different filtering strategies (user preference- based filtering, diversity and coverage-based filtering, and model-based filtering) to select key information to achieve unlearning. The augmentation stage integrates the filtered data, candidate items, and other auxiliary information into a prompt. Finally, the generation stage uses the prompt to call the LLM to generate recommendation results. The core of this algorithm is to effectively remove data that must be unlearned through filtering strategies, ensuring that the recommendations generated by the LLM meet the
