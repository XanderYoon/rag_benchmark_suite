Moreover, since SISA uses a very simple partition and aggregation strategy, it is faster than the other two partition aggregation frameworks. However, this simplicity also limits the performance of SISA in terms of model utility (see Table II). Our method demonstrates a significant advan- tage in unlearning time efficiency. Compared to the second- best values of these methods, it achieved average speedups of 1.5x, 4.4x, and 7.1x in the three datasets, respectively. This is because we leverage LLMs to shift the recommendation task from the dataset level to the user level. This atomic user- level recommendation enables more flexible control over each user’s recommendations and unlearning, thereby enhancing unlearning efficiency. As the number of unlearning interactions increases, the time consumption of our method grows linearly, while partition-aggregation methods experience exponential growth. According to Liu et al. [17], when the dataset is split into 10 partitions and 100 interactions are randomly selected for unlearning, the probability that all sub-models require retraining is close to 100%. In real-world scenarios, user unlearning requests typically come gradually, so the user- level unlearning method can quickly fulfill these needs in a timely manner. D. Unlearning Completeness (RQ3) To assess the effectiveness of CRAGRU in erasing user- specific influence, we compare recommendation performance on the forgotten set versus the remaining set, following simu- lated unlearning of 10% user-item interactions on
