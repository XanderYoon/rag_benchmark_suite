subset of the vital nuggets, and 𝑠𝑠 𝑣 𝑖 is 1 if the response supports the i-th nugget and is 0 otherwise. The score of a system is the mean of the scores across all queries. 4.3 Results Results in Table 1 show that using a single rewrite alone underper- forms even the original query, suggesting that naive rewriting can hurt retrieval effectiveness. While combining the original query with multiple rewrites improves recall, the gains saturate quickly. Adding more than three rewrites yields only marginal improve- ments, indicating diminishing returns beyond a small number of diverse reformulations. Notably, the recall achieved by using mul- tiple rewrites alone is consistently lower than the recall obtained when those rewrites are concatenated with the original query, un- derscoring the importance of preserving the original formulation.13 12https://github.com/usnistgov/trec_eval 13These experiments use TREC RAG data with a different retrieval collection, so the comparison to our pipeline is not direct. However, since we evaluate only the query rewriting component with retrieval frozen, the findings are expected to generalize to similar retrieval setups.
