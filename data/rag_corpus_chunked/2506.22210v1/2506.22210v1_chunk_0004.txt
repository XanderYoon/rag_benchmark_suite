limitations motivate more advanced context curation strategies, including unimportant token removal [17], content aggregation [43], and training extrac- tors and condensers [40, 41]. Approaches at TREC RAG’24 include extracting, combining, and condensing the relevant information [8], enhanced by verifying key facts across documents, rule-based re- dundancy removal, and enhancing coherence [6]. 3 Retrieval-Augmented Nugget-Based Response Generation Our approach, GINGER (which stands for Grounded Information Nugget-Based GEneration of Responses), operates on informa- tion nuggets. It explicitly models various facets of the query based on retrieved information and generates a concise response that adheres to length constraints. It generates the response in three steps by: (1) retrieving top relevant passages from the corpus, (2) curating retrieved context for response generation, and (3) synthe- sizing the collected information into a final response; see Figure 1. Our implementation adopts a modular architecture, with clearly separated components for each stage of the pipeline. This design allows for flexible experimentation and independent development of each component. All generation tasks, including query rewriting and context curation, are performed with the Falcon3-10B model2 accessed via the AI71 platform API.3 3.1 Document Retrieval To reduce omissions caused by narrow queries, we apply query rewriting before retrieval. An LLM, queried without external doc- uments, first generates a short answer to the original question. The assumption is that this intermediate answer surfaces the key aspects of the information need. We then ask the same model to generate 𝑙 additional queries, each focusing on a different aspect of that provisional answer while staying semantically consistent with the initial query.4 We combine each expanded query with the original, and then concatenate all 𝑙 rewrites together to create a final search string. Formally, 𝑞′ = (𝑞 + 𝑞′ 1) + · · · + (𝑞 + 𝑞′ 𝑙 ) where 𝑞 is the original
