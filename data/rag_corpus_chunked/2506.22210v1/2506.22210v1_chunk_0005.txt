focusing on a different aspect of that provisional answer while staying semantically consistent with the initial query.4 We combine each expanded query with the original, and then concatenate all 𝑙 rewrites together to create a final search string. Formally, 𝑞′ = (𝑞 + 𝑞′ 1) + · · · + (𝑞 + 𝑞′ 𝑙 ) where 𝑞 is the original query, and each 𝑞′ 𝑖 is a rewrite focusing on a different aspect of the intermediate answer. For retrieval, we adopt a two-stage retrieval pipeline, consisting of an initial passage retrieval step followed by re-ranking. First-pass retrieval is a combination of rankings obtained using both sparse and dense text representations. We use BM25 for sparse retrieval with an Opensearch-based index5 and intfloat/e5-base-v26 em- beddings with a Pinecone dense index.7 Both indices are pre-built and provided by the challenge organizers. The retrieval results are then combined using reciprocal rank fusion [ 4]. For re-ranking, we first apply a pointwise re-ranker ( castorini/monot5-base- msmarco),8 followed by a pairwise re-ranker ( castorini/duot5- base-msmarco),9 both fine-tuned on the MS MARCO collection [3], to refine the ranking and improve retrieval effectiveness. 2https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/Falcon3-10B-Instruct 3https://ai71.ai/ 4Prompts used for query rewriting can be found in Appendix B.1. 5https://opensearch.org/ 6https://huggingface.co/intfloat/e5-base-v2 7https://www.pinecone.io/ 8https://huggingface.co/castorini/monot5-base-msmarco 9https://huggingface.co/castorini/duot5-base-msmarco UiS-IAI@LiveRAG: Retrieval-Augmented Information Nugget-Based Generation of Responses 3.2 Context Curation Given the retrieved passages, GINGER curates the context before the generation step to optimize response grounding and informa- tion relevance. First, we detect information nuggets within the top-𝑚 ranked passages by prompting an LLM to annotate key in- formation without altering the original text. 10 Detected nuggets are then clustered according to different query facets to reduce redundancy and increase information density [1], leveraging the BERTopic model [13]. Next, facet clusters are ranked for relevance using DuoT5 pairwise reranking ensuring that the most crucial clusters are
