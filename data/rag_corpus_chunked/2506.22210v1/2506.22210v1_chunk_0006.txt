the top-𝑚 ranked passages by prompting an LLM to annotate key in- formation without altering the original text. 10 Detected nuggets are then clustered according to different query facets to reduce redundancy and increase information density [1], leveraging the BERTopic model [13]. Next, facet clusters are ranked for relevance using DuoT5 pairwise reranking ensuring that the most crucial clusters are prioritized for response generation [10, 24]. This struc- tured approach enables GINGER to distill key information while preserving source attribution. 3.3 Response Generation In the last step, GINGER transforms the ranked facet clusters into a coherent response. Each top-ranked cluster is independently sum- marized into one sentence, following a prompt design that enforces conciseness and faithfulness to the original content [12, 34].11 This modular summarization process ensures that the response remains factually accurate and grounded. However, since the response com- posed of independently summarized texts may lack fluency and coherence, we introduce a final refinement step where an LLM rephrases the response without introducing additional content. This ensures that the final output is not only factually reliable but also natural and readable, improving the overall user experience. 3.4 Batch Processing Details To improve the efficiency of our pipeline, queries are processed in batches. We implemented multiprocessing with a concurrent queu- ing system, allowing each pipeline component to operate indepen- dently as long as its input queue is populated. This prevented bot- tlenecks and maximized hardware utilization. GPU-intensive com- ponents were distributed across 12 GPUs, with pointwise reranking and response generation using 25% of total GPU resources and pairwise reranking the remaining 75%. During the challenge day, we used 8 Tesla V100 GPUs and 4 NVIDIA A100 GPUs. 4 Experiments In our experiments, we investigate our system’s robustness with respect to the quality of the retrieved information. We also evaluate its
