Original Query + Multi Rewrite (3) 0.397 Original Query + Multi Rewrite (5) 0.400 Original Query + Multi Rewrite (10) 0.398 Table 2 presents the evaluation of responses generated using different GINGER configurations, assessed with the AutoNuggetizer framework. We varied two key parameters: the number of docu- ments used for pairwise reranking (𝑘) and the number of documents used for response generation (𝑚). These parameters directly impact both the quality of the generated responses and the system’s effi- ciency. The reranking step with DuoT5 scales exponentially with 𝑘, while the number of Falcon API calls—dependent on 𝑚—is the main bottleneck in information nugget detection. Given the two-hour time limit for processing 500 queries during the challenge (with three parallel processes), we aimed for a setup capable of handling at least 100 queries per hour. Although the setup with 𝑘 = 50 and 𝑚 = 20 produced the best responses, it exceeded our time constraints. Configurations with 𝑘 = 40, 𝑚 = 10 and 𝑘 = 20, 𝑚 = 10 yielded similar scores with much more efficient runtimes. Despite 𝑘 = 20 scoring slightly higher, we selected𝑘 = 40 for our final submission to increase topic coverage and response diversity. This choice is further supported by the limitations of AutoNugge- tizer, which evaluates responses using nuggets extracted from only two documents. As a result, it may overlook relevant content cap- tured by a broader reranking scope. In our manual analysis, we observed low scores for responses that were clearly grounded in relevant retrieved passages but where the available ground-truth nuggets were sparse. Conversely, high scores occurred mainly when our responses aligned exactly with the nuggets identified by Au- toNuggetizer. This suggests that the framework’s effectiveness is constrained by its limited access to reference passages, which in turn restricts the evaluation of
