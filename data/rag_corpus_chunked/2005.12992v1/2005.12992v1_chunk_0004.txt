t it seems. Studies exploring children’s behavior as they inter act with IRS and evaluation strategies for kid-friendly IRS [11, 18] revealed that young users do not act in the same manners as adults do when interacting with or evaluating IRS [2, 11]. For example, kid s tend to click on the ﬁrst search result on a search result page rega rdless of its relevance [9, 10]. Naturally, the thought is to use the child’s clicked link as the relevant result but since they tend to fav or the ﬁrst result, regardless of relevance, does it work as ground truth? Even if you ask children what their judgments are, instead oftrying to infer them, you can still have problems. Consider when ask ing kids to rate on a standard 1 to 5 scale, studies have shown theytend to only rate 4’s or 5’s regardless of what they think [11]. Beh aviors like these make it hard to deﬁne what the ground truth of collected data is and how applicable it is for conducting oﬄine evaluat ions of IRS. 5 THE UNKNOWN The current state of evaluating IRS for children is in its inf ancy and it is indeed a complex undertaking driven by multiple per - spectives [17]. There is not general framework that can be us ed consistently and is accepted by the community as a whole; the re is no reliable and/or standard way to obtain data for evaluat ion; and ground truth requires a unique perspective of relevance and that is just not the case when it comes to IRS for children. The se is- sues showcase not only the importance of developing framewo rks without the need for massive amounts of data but also why in- volving the larger community to create it is key. The
