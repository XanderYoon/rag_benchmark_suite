4.0). " may be accessible, how children judge IRS diﬀers from the general population [11–13, 24]. We aim at showcasing (i) issues that our- selves and other researchers and practitioners face with da ta, user judgments, and frameworks, as well as (ii) the fact that eval uation that involves protected users is an issue with bigger implic ations that requires attention and must be informed by diﬀerent are as of the IR community and beyond. 2 THE TROUBLE WITH FRAMEWORKS Existing frameworks have set out to make the best of the data t hat is available to evaluate children’s IRS. The one presented i n [15] brings context to evaluating and designing children’s sear ch sys- tems with their four pillars: search strategy, user group, e nviron- ment, and task. While originally designed for search system s, it is general enough to be used for context in other IR tasks [7, 8 ]. However, the proposed framework does not explicitly addres s the limitations that arise due to lack of data. In [1], the authors present a framework to address the issue of relevance judgement with chil- dren regarding search. This framework is task-speciﬁc and w ould need manipulation to work with other IR tasks and areas. A use - ful framework that lends itself to IRS evaluation and that do es not require data from children is the Cranﬁeld paradigm [5]. Cra nﬁeld uses known suitable resources as ground truth. However, it h as been dropped and deemed outdated when evaluating IRS for gen - eral populations in favor of more state-of-the-art alterna tives. The latter tend to require large amounts of data that is not always avail- able with children making them not practical. Works like [23], have defended the Cranﬁeld paradigm as a viable framework, but th
