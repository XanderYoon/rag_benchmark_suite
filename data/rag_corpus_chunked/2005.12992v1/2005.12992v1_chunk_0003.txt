truth. However, it h as been dropped and deemed outdated when evaluating IRS for gen - eral populations in favor of more state-of-the-art alterna tives. The latter tend to require large amounts of data that is not always avail- able with children making them not practical. Works like [23], have defended the Cranﬁeld paradigm as a viable framework, but th e IR community is divided on this issue. In the end, existing frameworks are a helpful foundation but each has constraints that rende r them insuﬃcient for the IR community at large. 3 THE WOES OF DATA Due to privacy laws like the Children’s Online Privacy Prote ction Act, Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, and General Data Protection Regulation [6, 19, 20], children’s data is highly protected. While these safeguards are of the upmost importance to keep c hil- dren safe online, it makes collecting or ﬁnding children’s d ata diﬃ- cult. Thus, unless researchers have a means of gathering theneeded data within the bounds of the child privacy laws themselves, it is impossible to get such data. Even then, there are additional rules as to what can be collected (e.g., demographics), and how it m ust be stored. These stringent rules (i) make it extremely burde nsome to share data and (ii) can lead to insuﬃcient data for evaluat ing IRS for children. 4 THE AMBIGUITY OF JUDGMENT Existing ground truth may be misleading–it is not always wha t it seems. Studies exploring children’s behavior as they inter act with IRS and evaluation strategies for kid-friendly IRS [11, 18] revealed that young users do not act in the same manners as adults do when interacting with or evaluating IRS [2, 11]. For example, kid s tend to click on the ﬁrst search result on a search result page
