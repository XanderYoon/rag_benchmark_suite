dataset, it is proposed that question-answer data from multiple uni- versities be incorporated. Each university can have its unique structure, curriculum, and question patterns, which, when combined, create a more generalized dataset suitable for a wide range of academic scenarios. By pooling datasets from multiple institutions, the model will gain exposure to a wider variety of scholarly discourse, which can improve its perfor- mance across different contexts and subject areas. C. Contribution 3: Integrating Real-Time Updates Integrating the dataset with course selection departments for real-time updates is crucial to maintaining its relevance and accuracy. This connection ensures that new questions and answers reflecting the most current course offerings and content are continuously added to the dataset. This approach will ensure that the model stays up-to-date with the latest academic developments, enhancing its utility and accuracy for real-time student inquiries. By implementing these contributions, the pipeline will be- come more dynamic and capable of handling a wider range of questions in various academic contexts while ensuring up-to-date information is always available to users. These advancements are expected to lead to a more effective and adaptive question-answer system for students and educators alike. REFERENCES [1] P. Lewis, E. Perez, A. Piktus, F. Petroni, V .
