were designed to complement the student-provided data and fill in any gaps in coverage. The collected data from these two sources forms the initial set of questions, denoted as Qstudent. This step is formulated in Equation 2: Qstudent = {questionj}M j=1 (2) where questionj represents each individual question and M is the total number of questions collected. where questionj represents each individual question and M is the total number of questions collected. To supplement the student-provided questions, we used GPT-4 to generate additional questions. We implemented a Python script to automate the generation of a comprehensive question set, ensuring a diverse and complete dataset. Step 3: Let Qgpt represent the set of questions generated by GPT-4. This is formulated in the Equation 3: Qgpt = {questionk}P k=1, (3) where questionk represents each individual question generated by GPT-4 and P is the total number of generated questions. Step 4: The combined set of questions, Qcombined, includes both student-provided and GPT-generated questions, this equa- tion can be shown in the Equation 4. Qcombined = Qstudent ∪ Qgpt, (4) To ensure the accuracy and relevance of the answers, we manually curated the responses with the help of human feed- back. This iterative process involved verifying and updating the answers based on student feedback. Step 5: The set of validated question-answer pairs, QAvalid, is established in the Equation 5. QAvalid = {(questionj, answerj)}T j=1, (5) where T corresponds to the Total number of GPT and Human Questions.Additionally, answerj corresponds to the manually validated answer for question j. The final dataset comprises over 500 documents, encom- passing a wide range of contexts to ensure comprehensive coverage. These documents include detailed information about the academic groups and sections of each department, pro- fessors along with their contact emails, and various aspects of the university, such as
