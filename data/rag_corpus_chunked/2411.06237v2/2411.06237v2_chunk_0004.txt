justs the LLM’s input prompt based on whether the user query necessitates external context retrieval, thereby enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of RAG systems [11]. C. Applications and Case Studies The versatility of RAG is evident in its wide range of applications. For example, RAG has been successfully applied to AI-generated content, enhancing the quality and contex- tual relevance of the outputs. Another significant application is the integration of RAG across heterogeneous knowledge bases, which has proven effective in generating coherent and contextually appropriate responses [12]. Practical applications in high-performance computing for code development fur- ther demonstrate its versatility [13]. Specifically, Graph-based approaches like GNN-RAG and KG-RAG have significantly improved handling complex queries and enhancing factual consistency [14], [15]. D. Frameworks and Implementations Several frameworks and implementations have been pro- posed to facilitate the deployment of RAG systems. The University of Massachusetts introduced Stochastic RAG, an end-to-end framework that leverages stochastic methods for retrieval and generation, ensuring high relevance and diver- sity in the outputs [16]. Additionally, the Spring AI project demonstrates the practical application of RAG using Azure OpenAI, providing valuable insights into the integration of RAG with cloud-based AI services [17]. The Semantic Kernel framework by Microsoft offers another robust implementation for RAG [18]. KRAGEN, a knowledge graph-enhanced RAG framework, has also been developed for biomedical problem- solving, illustrating the application of RAG in specialized domains [19]. E. Leveraging RAG in Specific Domain Tasks RAG has shown significant potential in addressing specific domain tasks, such as enhancing university information sys- tems. By crawling university websites and creating datasets tailored to students’ queries, RAG can effectively answer questions related to different departments and services. This approach not only improves the accuracy of information retrieval but also enhances the overall user experience by providing precise and relevant answers to specific
