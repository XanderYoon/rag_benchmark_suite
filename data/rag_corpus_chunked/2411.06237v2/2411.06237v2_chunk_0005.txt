potential in addressing specific domain tasks, such as enhancing university information sys- tems. By crawling university websites and creating datasets tailored to students’ queries, RAG can effectively answer questions related to different departments and services. This approach not only improves the accuracy of information retrieval but also enhances the overall user experience by providing precise and relevant answers to specific queries [13], [20]. Graph-based approaches have further enhanced RAG’s capabilities in handling domain-specific tasks by integrating structured knowledge representations [21], [22]. F . Challenges and Future Directions Despite the promising advancements, several challenges remain in the implementation of RAG. A survey by Semantic Scholar identifies key obstacles, including the complexity of integrating retrieval mechanisms with generation models and ensuring the scalability of such systems [23]. The tutorial by IJCAI further discusses recent advances and outlines future research directions to overcome these challenges, emphasizing the need for continued innovation in this field [24]. III. D ATASET GENERATION A. Data Production Process The data generation process for our UniversityQuestion- Bench dataset involves several key steps to ensure the col- lection of relevant and frequently asked questions by students. We initiated the process by identifying the most important data from the University of Isfahan’s website. 2 . This data extraction step is crucial for forming the foundational dataset. Step 1: We start by collecting data D from the university’s official website, focusing on the most critical and frequently accessed information by students. The first step is represented in the Equation 1: D = {datai}N i=1 (1) where datai represents individual pieces of information and N is the total number of data items extracted. Next, we surveyed students to gather insights on the most common questions they encounter. The survey results were recorded and analyzed to identify patterns and frequently asked questions. Step 2:
