performance of Dorna with Dorna Embed- dings (0.839) is competitive, highlighting the capa- bility of localized embeddings specifically designed for Persian-language content. – Models utilizing Persian-Sentence-Embedding-V3 (e.g., GPT-3.5-turbo, 0.8113 ) exhibit slightly re- duced faithfulness compared to OpenAI Embed- dings, suggesting limitations in the current iteration of these embeddings for ensuring strict fidelity to source information. • Answer Relevancy: – Answer relevancy assesses the alignment of the gen- erated response with the user’s query, a critical factor for user satisfaction. – Dorna with Dorna Embeddings outperforms other models with a score of 0.823 , demonstrating its strength in producing highly relevant responses tai- lored to Persian-language queries. This indicates the effectiveness of the Dorna model in embedding semantic understanding of user intent in Persian. – The lowest score for this metric is observed with GPT-3.5-turbo using Persian-Sentence- Embedding-V3 (0.493) , suggesting potential challenges in aligning query semantics with response generation when utilizing this embedding. • Context Relevancy: – Context relevancy measures how well the generated response incorporates broader contextual understand- ing, ensuring a coherent and comprehensive answer. – GPT-3.5-turbo with Persian-Sentence- Embedding-V3 achieves the highest context relevancy score ( 0.223), demonstrating its relative strength in capturing and incorporating contextual nuances, despite lower performance in other metrics. – Dorna with Dorna Embeddings also performs well (0.216), reflecting its capacity to balance context incorporation with other aspects of performance. Observations and Insights: • Trade-offs between Models and Embeddings: – GPT-3.5-turbo with OpenAI Embeddings delivers the best performance in faithfulness, reflecting the general applicability and robustness of these embed- dings across various datasets. – Conversely, Dorna with Dorna Embeddings ex- hibits superior performance in answer relevancy, em- phasizing the importance of leveraging embeddings specifically designed for Persian text in achieving domain-specific objectives. • Performance Variability of Persian-Specific Embed- dings: While Persian-Sentence-Embedding-V3 demon- strates
