By systematically extracting data from the university’s official website, primarily in Persian, and employing advanced prompt engineering techniques, we generate accurate and contextually relevant responses to user queries. We developed a comprehensive university benchmark, Univer- sityQuestionBench (UQB), to rigorously evaluate our system’s performance. UQB focuses on Persian-language data, assessing accuracy and reliability through various metrics and real-world scenarios. Our experimental results demonstrate significant im- provements in the precision and relevance of generated responses, enhancing user experiences, and reducing the time required to obtain relevant answers. In summary, this paper presents a novel application of RAG pipelines and LLMs for Persian-language data retrieval, sup- ported by a meticulously prepared university benchmark, offer- ing valuable insights into advanced AI techniques for academic data retrieval and setting the stage for future research in this domain.1 Index Terms —LLMs, Local Datasets, Knowledge Retrieval, Academic Question Answering I. I NTRODUCTION Large Language Models (LLMs), including cutting-edge ones like OpenAI GPTs and Google Gemini models, often face significant challenges when it comes to extracting and utilizing local data, particularly from specialized datasets such as universities archives. These models are typically trained on broad, diverse datasets, which can result in a lack of specificity and accuracy when applied to niche domains. The challenges include the inability to access and process
