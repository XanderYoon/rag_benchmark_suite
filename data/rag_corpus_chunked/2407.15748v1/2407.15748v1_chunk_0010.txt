the context of Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVEs) and Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs). • Structured RAG: The first of the two RAGs is composed by retrievers that retrieve information from pre-processed, structured data. The pre-processing phase involves con- verting chunks of text from various sources that are part of the knowledge base, such as academic papers and cybersecurity websites, into well-defined structures. These structures are designed to contain generated ques- tions and contextualized entity descriptions that facilitate the precise retrieval of information in response to user queries. • Unstructured RAG: This RAG is used if the structured RAG could not find a suitable answer. It searches for information in unstructured and unprocessed raw text that belongs to its knowledge base. Accessing unstructured data allows the exploration of data in its original form without the limitations imposed by preprocessing, thus providing a wider range of search options in exchange for a higher response time. This type enables the explo- ration of data in its original form without the restrictions imposed by preprocessing. Fig. 1: MoRSE Overview. The RAGs will compose the answer to each query and return it to the GUI for structured visualization. In the following we will detail the components of the MoRSE Core. B. MoRSE Core a) MoRSE Core Workflow : Figure 2 shows the first stage of MoRSE Core process, starting with the Query Handling model. This module converts the original query x into an opti- mized version x∗ (see subsection III-C). First, x∗ is forwarded to the Structured RAG module for processing. The structured RAG path, denoted as S, begins with the Structured Retrievers, focused on high accuracy and fast responses to efficiently process most queries. Their primary function, S(x∗), is to identify and retrieve information pertinent to the query. When activated, the structured retrieval process,
