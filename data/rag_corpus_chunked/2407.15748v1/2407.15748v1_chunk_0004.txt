knowledge at test time. In contrast, Parametric-only models require the entire model to be retrained, which can be both time-consuming and resource-intensive. Using a comprehensive set of 600 cybersecurity questions, consisting of 150 General Cybersecurity questions, 150 Multi- Hop (i.e., questions involving multiple entities contained in different documents) Cybersecurity questions, and 300 CVE questions (on vulnerabilities), we evaluated MoRSE along- side other commercial, well-known LLMs, including GPT- 46, GEMINI 7, MIXTRAL [19], and HACKERGPT 8. The questions were classified based on the Diamond Model [20], which we used to create questions that are representative of the real needs of the cybersecurity world. Two experts validated the ground truth of the questions, with a Cohen’s Kappa [21], [22] index as a measure of agreement between the two experts equal to 0.82 out of 1. The comparative analysis shows the superior performance of MoRSE for cybersecurity queries. In terms of relevance and correctness of answers [23], MoRSE outperforms other models by more than 15% for General questions and by more than 10% for Multi-Hop questions and CVE Questions. In terms of accuracy, MoRSE outperforms GPT-4 by 50% for 2https://attack.mitre.org/ 3https://cve.mitre.org/ 4https://www.metasploit.com/ 5https://www.exploit-db.com/ 6https://chat.openai.com/ 7https://gemini.google.com/app 8https://chat.hackerai.co/ CVE Questions. This confirms its effectiveness in specialized domains. We validated these results with the LLM as a Judge method [24], which derives Elo ratings for each model and confirms MoRSE’s leading performance compared to all competitors. The main contributions of our work can be summarized as follows: • We introduce MoRSE, an open-source framework9 which is the first attempt to integrate two RAG systems to handle multidimensional cybersecurity contexts. This architec- ture enables a unique synthesis of different data sources and improves the depth and relevance of security insights. • We introduce a three-part evaluation test suite that mea- sures the relevance, similarity and correctness of
