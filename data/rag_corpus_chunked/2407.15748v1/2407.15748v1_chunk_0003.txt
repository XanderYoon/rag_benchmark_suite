Experts), a novel framework developed for Question and Answering tasks in the field of cybersecurity. Unlike other chatbots MoRSE is the first RAG framework that aims to provide comprehensive coverage of cybersecurity knowledge. To achieve this, MoRSE uses two RAG systems in cascade. These two RAGs divide the process into two distinct phases: Information Retrieval phase, which is managed by Multiple Retrievers , followed by the answer generation phase, which is driven by Large Language Models . The first RAG, called Structured RAG , comprises retrievers that are tailored to fast retrieval tasks, as they retrieve information from preprocessed, structured data. The second, Unstructured RAG, is slower due to its higher complexity, but retrieves a larger amount of information as it enables the exploration of data in its original form. The second RAG is only activated if the first RAG does not find any relevant documents for a specific query. Each retriever is specialized in a specific area of cybersecurity and collects data from key resources such as MITRE2, CVE repositories 3, Metasploit4, and ExploitDB 5. The name of our system, MoRSE, is in fact inspired by the Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm [18], reflecting the specialized skills of the individual retrievers. In addition, MoRSE receives new knowledge through real-time updates of its retrievers’ knowledge bases, which enables a continuous expansion of knowledge. Indeed, a key advantage of non- parametric memory models such as RAG is the ability to update knowledge at test time. In contrast, Parametric-only models require the entire model to be retrained, which can be both time-consuming and resource-intensive. Using a comprehensive set of 600 cybersecurity questions, consisting of 150 General Cybersecurity questions, 150 Multi- Hop (i.e., questions involving multiple entities contained in different documents) Cybersecurity questions, and 300 CVE questions (on vulnerabilities), we evaluated MoRSE along-
