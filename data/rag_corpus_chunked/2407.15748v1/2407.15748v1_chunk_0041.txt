[80] present a knowledge graph for APT attack mapping that combines deep learning with network defense expertise. Mitra et al. [81] augment CKGs with provenance information to combat fake cybersecurity information and ensure data reliability. In comparison, MoRSE addresses the limitations of Knowl- edge Graphs (KGs) in cybersecurity by providing dynamic updates with real-time adjustments as opposed to the manual revisions of KGs. It also provides interactive query capabilities that are real-time and interactive as opposed to the static KGs. In addition, MoRSE offers improved customizability and modularity, which allows for greater adaptability and easier expansion of the knowledge base compared to the fixed structures of KGs. c) LLMs and Chatbots in Cybersecurity Landscape : Re- search into chatbots in cybersecurity highlights their role in education, ethics and regulation. Yoo et al. (2024) and Abu- Amara et al. (2024) explore the impact of GDPR and the use of gamified chatbots in education, while Pieterse (2024) evaluates the utility of ChatGPT in guiding students through cybersecurity CTF challenges, noting that it reaches its limits in providing direct solutions [82], [83], [84]. Mitra et al. [85] developed LOCALINTEL, which presents an automated sys- tem that uses LLMs to create organisation-specific threat intelligence from global and local databases to improve the efficiency of SoC operations. Juttner et al. [86] use ChatGPT to make IDS alerts understandable to non-experts, improving 13 network security in the home and home office environment. However, concerns about trust, privacy and ethics highlight the need for further research before widespread adoption. Yoo et al. [87] use CNN classifiers and AI chatbot to detect and combat SNS phishing attacks before they can occur. This is more promising than traditional methods because it provides real-time support and actions on Telegram, with validated effectiveness against LSTM models. Iqbal et al. [88] explore
