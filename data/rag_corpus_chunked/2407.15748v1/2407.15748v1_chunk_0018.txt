e) Entity Retriever : This retriever contains entities from document chunks together with their descriptions extracted from the context of the chunk. During the pre-processing phase, we segment the documents into 500-word chunks. This segmentation enables the model ( θ) to identify and classify relevant entities more precisely. The contextual descriptions for each entity are then created using the mistralai/Mistral-7B- Instruct-v0.2 model and converted by ( β) embeddings into a searchable format that is retrievable with a similarity threshold of 0.5 (Q3 of the test distribution). f) Malware Retriever : This retriever contains more than 1000 malware source codes originating from GitHub pages. The Malware Retriever uses a semantic search with ( α) embeddings and a threshold value of 0.7 (median of the test distribution) to match search queries with malware names. In case of matches, all related files are displayed on the graphical interface. g) CWE Retriever : The CWE Retriever uses a semantic search with ( α) embeddings to match user queries with CWE descriptions, as described in Section III-C. Operating with a threshold of 0.7 (Q3 of the test distribution), it showcases the 6 10 most relevant CWEs. When a query closely aligns with a CWE, the retriever presents detailed information, including code examples. h) Context Construction: When creating the final context for the prompt, inputs from two main sources (code snippets and contextual information) are organized to ensure visibility and impact during the Generation Phase: • Code Snippets : Following the Lost In the Middle prin- ciple [55], code snippets from Metasploit and ExploitDB are prioritized at the beginning of the prompt so that they are immediately visible. • Contextual Information : To ensure that essential and concise information is presented to the LLM, the content from the queries Mitre, CWE and Entity retrievers is placed
