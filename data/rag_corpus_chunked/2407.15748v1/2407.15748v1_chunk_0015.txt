used the median value of the test distributions as threshold for the MITRE Retriever and the Malware Retriever , as these typically retrieve shorter texts. For Question Retrieval System , CWE Retriever , Metasploit Retriever and Entity Retriever , we chose the third quartile (Q3) of the test distributions as threshold, as they generally retrieve longer texts. The ExploitDB Retriever works without a threshold and uses the TF-IDF algorithm [52]. To mitigate embedding biases [53], we used two different embeddings for the retrievers, (α) and (β). The following paragraphs delineate each retriever’s functionalities. a) Mitre Retriever : The knowledge base of this retriever comes from the website of the MITRE Corporation 14. It is structured as a graph database containing two primary node categories: Malware and Techniques. Each Malware node in the database contains a name and a description of MITRE. We create Technique nodes, which consist of technique names and descriptions, by collecting and analysing technique-related 12https://haystack.deepset.ai/ 13https://github.com/Mixture-of-RAGs-Security- Experts/MoRSE/tree/main/Retriever-Threshold-Scores 14https://attack.mitre.org/software/ 5 Algorithm 2 Query Handling Process Input: A user query q on a specific cybersecurity topic. Output: A series of refined queries Q′ for in-depth analysis. 1: procedure VULNERABILITY EXTRACTOR (q) 2: Extract keywords K related to CVE and CWE from q. 3: Retrieve detailed descriptions D for each keyword in K from relevant databases. 4: Update q by substituting each keyword in K with its corresponding description from D, yielding q′. 5: return q′ 6: end procedure 7: procedure ENTITY EXTRACTOR (q′) 8: Utilize the Haystack framework with ”dslim/bert-base- NER” to detect entities E in q′. 9: Start with an empty Queries_List Q and include q′. 10: for each detected entity e ∈ E do 11: if e refers to a person (PER) then 12: Append a question about e to Q: "Who is e?" 13: else if
