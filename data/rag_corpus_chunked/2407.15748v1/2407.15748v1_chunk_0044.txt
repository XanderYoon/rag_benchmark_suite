have implemented an evaluation suite to assess the relevance, similarity, and correctness of the answers generated by our system compared to ground truth. The performance of our system was com- pared to other renowned commercial Large Language Models (LLMs) using two additional test suites that adhere to the LLM as a Judge paradigm. The results show that our system outperforms competing models by more than 10% in terms of the correctness and relevance of the given answers and by 50% in terms of accuracy against GPT-4 for questions related to vulnerabilities. In order to make the framework publicly available, our goal is to improve MoRSE with a Prefix-aware Greedy replacement policy (PAGRP) [96] for the semantic cache. This takes into account the initial segments of queries or data to make more informed decisions about what data to store in the cache. The PAGRP prioritizes the cache items based on their access frequency and size, ensuring that the system stores the most useful data and minimizes the likelihood of cache misses. In addition, we plan to replace the MITRE retriever with a comprehensive Knowledge Graph. This Knowledge Graph will include mitigation and detection approaches and aggre- gate real malware reports associated with the corresponding MITRE software. This solution enables better threat insights by allowing the computation of community analysis, centrality algorithms, and threat similarities quickly and in real-time. REFERENCES [1] B. Shin and P.
