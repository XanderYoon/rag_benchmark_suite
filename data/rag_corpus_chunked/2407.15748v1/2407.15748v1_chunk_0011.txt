version x∗ (see subsection III-C). First, x∗ is forwarded to the Structured RAG module for processing. The structured RAG path, denoted as S, begins with the Structured Retrievers, focused on high accuracy and fast responses to efficiently process most queries. Their primary function, S(x∗), is to identify and retrieve information pertinent to the query. When activated, the structured retrieval process, which is executed via S(x∗), assigns a set of potentially relevant documents from a predefined Knowledge Base to the query x∗. In particular, D = top-k(S(x∗)) represents the selection of the top k documents that S considers most relevant for the query based on a similarity score. If D is not empty ( |D| > 0), this means that a relevant context has been found. The workflow then proceeds to use this context and moves on to the next phase, where the retrieved information ( D) is wrapped in a Prompt, which is used by LLM to generate a response. If the Structured Retrievers do not yield relevant documents (|D| = 0 ), the workflow moves to the unstructured path and calls the Unstructured Retrievers, denoted as U. At this stage, E = top-k(U (x∗)) represents the set of documents retrieved by U, which are designed to process complex queries that are not readily covered by structured data patterns. After a successful retrieval of relevant information in one of the two ways — indicated by |D| > 0 for structured retrieval or |E| > 0 for unstructured retrieval —the Wrapper module integrates the acquired context and generates a prompt for the Large Language Model (LLM). The LLM then performs Answer Generation, creating a detailed response to the user’s question. b) RAG Architecture: The RAG architecture of the MoRSE system, which is used in both the Structured (III-D) and Unstructured RAG
