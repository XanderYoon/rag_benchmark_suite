arise in complex question-answering tasks where a single piece of evidence is insufficient to resolve the query, and the sys- tem must hop across different data points or documents to piece together a response. III. M ORSE A RCHITECTURE This section describes the structure of the MoRSE system in detail. It explains the function of the individual components and how they interact to process a request and generate a response. We used the Langchain framework 10 to develop the MoRSE architecture. The Table I contains the key to the symbols used in this explanation to facilitate the understanding of the following discussion. The first two symbols, ( α) and (β), are embedding models, while the last two, ( γ) and ( θ), are Transformer models. TABLE I: Mapping of Symbols to Values.

MoRSE Overview As shown in Figure 1, MoRSE consists of two main compo- nents: a graphical user interface (GUI) and the MoRSE core. The GUI enables interaction with the user by allowing the input of queries and displaying the answers in a structured way11. 10https://www.langchain.com/ 11https://github.com/Mixture-of-RAGs-Security-Experts/MoRSE 3 The MoRSE core consists of three key components, which in turn manage the user query and compose the answer: • Query Handling Module: This module performs the pre-processing of user queries and specializes in the management of multi-hop queries and complex questions, especially in the context of Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVEs) and Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs). • Structured RAG: The first of the two RAGs is composed by retrievers that retrieve information from pre-processed, structured data. The pre-processing phase involves con- verting chunks of text from various sources that are part of the knowledge base, such as academic papers and cybersecurity websites, into
