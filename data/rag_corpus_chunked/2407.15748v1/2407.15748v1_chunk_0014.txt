the User query Q. 16: A ← LLM (P ) ▷ Use the Large Language Model to generate an answer. 17: return A 18: end procedure • CVE-CWE Keyword Extraction : Extracts keywords related to CVEs and CWEs when a query is received. • Get CVE Description : Retrieves detailed descriptions of CVEs, including information about vulnerabilities, affected software and finders. • Get CWE Description : Retrieves descriptions of CWEs that provide information about the type of software vul- nerabilities, potential impact and mitigation strategies. • Entity Extractor : Utilizes the Haystack framework 12 with the θ model to identify and extract relevant entities (people or concepts) from user queries, improving the system’s ability to handle Multi-Hop queries. The complete workflow is outlined in Algorithm 2, demon- strating the mechanism of Query Handling within the MoRSE system. D. Structured RAG As illustrated in Figure 4, the Structured RAG module works post-Query Handling by forwarding refined queries to seven Parallel Retrievers, called Structured Retrievers, each of which specializes in specific cybersecurity topics. Given a query, the information contained in the knowledge base of a Retriever is inserted into the Context if its similarity to the query is above a predefined threshold. In order to establish the threshold for each retriever, we conducted an analysis on the scores of top 50 results from a series of test queries. Thresholds were then determined by assessing the distribution of scores 13. In particular, we used the median value of the test distributions as threshold for the MITRE Retriever and the Malware Retriever , as these typically retrieve shorter texts. For Question Retrieval System , CWE Retriever , Metasploit Retriever and Entity Retriever , we chose the third quartile (Q3) of the test distributions as threshold, as they generally retrieve longer texts.
