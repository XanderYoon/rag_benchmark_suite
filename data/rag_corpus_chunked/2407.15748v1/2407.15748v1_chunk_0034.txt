interval. a) Analysis of the performance of Structured Retrievers : Table VII shows the performance metrics for Structured RAG Retrievers within the MoRSE system. TheExploitDB Retriever Size is not listed as it uses TF-IDF for retrieval. The Malware Retriever processes queries with average times of 0.061 sec- onds on GPU and 0.110 seconds on CPU. The CWE Retriever and the MITRE Retriever have average processing times of 0.083 and 0.057 seconds on GPU and 0.108 and 0.13 seconds on CPU. For the ExploitDB Retriever , the average processing times are 1.254 seconds on GPU and 2.377 seconds on CPU. The Metasploit Retriever shows average times of 0.995 seconds on GPU and 1.367 seconds on CPU when processing a 40MB dense retriever. In addition, Question Retrieval System and Entity Retriever are noteworthy as they have the largest dense retrievers within the Structured RAG components at 3.863 GB and 554 MB respectively. The Question Retrieval System has an average processing time of 2.536 seconds on the CPU and 2.492 seconds on the GPU. The Entity Retriever achieves a moderate processing time of 0.250 seconds on the GPU and 0.268 seconds on the CPU due to its relatively high density. b) Analysis of the Performances of Unstructured RAG Com- ponents: As shown in Table VII, GPU processing significantly increases performance, especially for components that work with large data sets. The T EXT BUFFERS saw significant performance gains when transitioning to the GPU, likely due to their large data size of 185 MB, which is reflected in a reduction in average time from 85.22 seconds on the CPU to 1.789 seconds on the GPU.
