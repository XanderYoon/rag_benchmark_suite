has raised questions about their sustainability [31]. Efforts to overcome these challenges include research into more efficient training methods and models that are able to understand and generate texts with greater accuracy and less bias [32]. B. Retrieval Augmented Generation Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines traditional language models with external databases to improve natural language processing (NLP) tasks [33], [34], [35]. RAG models use a retriever to retrieve relevant information and a genera- tor to generate answers based on the retrieved information. This improves accuracy and relevance, especially for domain- specific queries [36], [16]. RAG’s strengths lie in its ability to update knowledge bases without retraining and customise components for specific tasks such as cybersecurity [33], [34]. However, RAG struggles with latency and scalability issues, especially when processing concurrent queries [33]. Despite these limitations, RAG remains a versatile tool for a range of NLP applications, from chatbots to content creation. Ongo- ing research focuses on optimizing retrieval mechanisms and computational power [36], [16]. C. Definitions We report in the following a set of definitions which will be used in the rest of the paper: • Retriever is a component that identifies and retrieves relevant information or documents from a knowledge base. This process is essential to provide the necessary context and content that LLM uses to generate accurate and informed answers [35], [37]. • Knowledge Base is a repository of information that the retriever accesses to find relevant data or documents. This is fundamental to the system’s ability to retrieve contextually relevant content, essential for generating well-informed and accurate answers [38]. • Embeddings are numerical representations of text that assign a low dimension to a term. Within this context, embedding vectors of analogous terms exhibit proximity, encapsulating semantic meaning. This facilitates the com- parison between queries and the knowledge base [39].
