Code Snippets : Following the Lost In the Middle prin- ciple [55], code snippets from Metasploit and ExploitDB are prioritized at the beginning of the prompt so that they are immediately visible. • Contextual Information : To ensure that essential and concise information is presented to the LLM, the content from the queries Mitre, CWE and Entity retrievers is placed at the end of the prompt. The more comprehensive outputs of the Question Retriever, which is equipped with a reordering function that respects the Lost In the Middle principle [55], are placed in the middle. E. Unstructured RAG The unstructured RAG, shown in Figure 5, plays a crucial role in the MoRSE system by handling cybersecurity queries that the structured RAG cannot solve. The module utilizes retrievers, called buffers, to store documents in chunks of 2000 characters while maintaining the integrity of the original information. All buffers work as hybrid retrievers that use both semantic search and keyword search with the BM25 algorithm [56]. Unlike other configurations, these retrievers do not have a fixed threshold for semantic search; instead, they are configured to return the top five documents regardless of similarity scores. This decision enables further Context Transformation process to apply semantic thresholds, ensuring the flexibility and comprehensiveness of the retrieval process. Fig. 5: Unstructured RAG Workflow a) Classification of Buffers : Buffers are categorized accord- ing to the type of data they process, and there are four different types of buffers: • Text Buffers: Process content from websites and blogs with five separate buffers, each analyzing data using the (α) embedding. • Metasploit Buffers : five buffers containing entire codes from the Metasploit framework that uses the ( α) embed- ding for effective processing. • Code Buffers : A single buffer processes code snippets from Exploit DB and also
