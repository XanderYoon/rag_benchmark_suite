Koloveas et al. [70] created the inTIME framework, which leverages machine learning to transform web data into actionable CTI, streamlining the intelligence lifecycle with a unified platform for intelligence collection, analysis and sharing. At the same time, a new threat modeling language has been developed by Xiong et al. [71] based on the MITRE Enterprise ATT&CK Matrix that integrates key elements of enterprise security to improve defense strategies through simulations. Husari et al. [72] further refines CTI analysis by automating the extraction of threat actions from unstructured texts, employing NLP and IR for semantic extraction and aligning attack patterns with standards like STIX 2.1, achieving significant precision and recall in its evaluations. MoRSE goes beyond current NER technologies by providing dynamic entity recognition and response generation. It identi- fies named entities in user queries in real time and uses this information to generate precise, contextualised responses. b) Knowledge Graphs for Cybersecurity : Knowledge graphs (KGs) are revolutionizing cybersecurity, from threat intelli- gence to education. Agrawal et al. [73] have shown how KGs from unstructured text enhance cybersecurity learning, with student feedback highlighting improved understanding and engagement. Sewak et al. developed CRUSH [74], which inte- grates Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5/GPT- 4/ChatGPT with Enterprise
