Retriever: The knowledge base of this retriever is made up of exploits from the ExploitDB framework. These codes often lack descriptions, so we use a keyword search with the TF-IDF algorithm [52] to focus only on important data such as CVE identifiers and author names, which are usually at the beginning of the scripts. To increase the retrieval speed, we only index the first 600 characters of each script, as this information is often contained in the first sections of the code. d) Question Retrieval System : This system acts as a knowl- edge base containing questions extracted from chunks of the original documents to better select the most important parts of the document and the explanations contained therein. A user query is compared with these questions and if there is a match, the chunk from which the matching question was extracted is retrieved. During preprocessing, documents are divided into 2000-character chunks. Model (γ) generates about seven questions per chunk, which are refined with Mistral- 7B-Instruct-v0.2 [54] for better alignment. The system uses (β) embeddings and deploys four retrievers in sequence, each selecting the ten most relevant documents. The results are merged, filtered with a similarity threshold of 0.6 (Q3 of the test distribution) and reordered based on the Lost In the Middle Principle [55], by placing key information at the beginning or end of the context. Redundant questions targeting the same document chunk are removed to streamline the context. e) Entity Retriever : This retriever contains entities from document chunks together with their descriptions extracted from the context of the chunk. During the pre-processing phase, we segment the documents into 500-word chunks. This segmentation enables the model ( θ) to identify and classify relevant entities more precisely. The contextual descriptions for each entity are then created using the mistralai/Mistral-7B-
