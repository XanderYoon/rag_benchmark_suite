For METASPLOIT BUFFER , the GPU significantly improved ef- ficiency by managing the 186 MB dataset more effectively and reducing the average time. M ETASPLOIT BUFFER size is different the Structured Metasploit Retriever Size because the first contains the entire codes. The C ONTEXT TRANSFOR - MATION with the highest computational requirements showed the GPU’s advantage in processing large amounts of data, a critical aspect of tasks that require fast data analysis and processing, highlighting the adaptability of the MoRSE system to hardware improvements. Unstructured RAG components show a significant perfor- mance increase when running on GPUs, so they are preferred to run on GPU architectures, but only when the structured RAG fails. This is to ensure that the considerable memory re- sources required for the large buffers of unstructured RAG are utilized and sufficient memory is retained for the generation task. c) Structured Retrievers Failure Rate Analysis : The aim is to estimate the probability of the Structured Retrievers not finding relevant text data in response to a user query, so that a switch to the Unstructured RAG is necessary to continue the search for relevant information. To this end, we have focused on looking only at the Contextual Information part of the final Context (see Figure 4). We have individually multiplied the retrievers’ failure rates listed in Table VII, determining a collective probability of failure at approximately 0.2569%, equal to an empirical rate ( ˆp) of 0.0026. When assessing reliability, we used a 95% confidence interval [62], the empirical rate, a z-score of 1.96, and the Failure Rates (Fail.Rate) from Table VII. This analysis
