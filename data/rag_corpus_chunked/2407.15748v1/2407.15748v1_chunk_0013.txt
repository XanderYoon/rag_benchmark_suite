dataset for this type of query [48], [49]. • Context Enriching: Generates additional questions from each identified entity, expanding and enriching the con- text available for generating informed answers. • Solving the CVE-CWE Conundrum : Effectively han- dles queries related to Common Vulnerabilities and Ex- posures (CVE) and Common Weakness Enumerations (CWE), which are challenging for generative models due to their technical complexity [50], [51]. 2) Components: • User Query: Initiates the process when a user submits a query via the graphical user interface. 4 Fig. 2: MoRSE Core Workflow.
