support for diverse datasets and advanced retriever configurations. Tools such as LangChain [12], LlamaIndex [54], and DSPy [44] fur- ther contribute to the ecosystem by simplifying model integration and workflow design. A comparison of retrieval, re-ranking, and RAG toolkits is presented in Table 1, highlighting the advantages of Rankify in dataset diversity, retriever and re-ranker support, and modularity. 3 Rankify Modern information retrieval systems rely on a combination of retrieval, ranking, and generative techniques to surface relevant content and generate accurate responses. However, existing solu- tions are often fragmented, requiring researchers and practitioners to integrate multiple toolkits to experiment with different retrieval and ranking strategies.Rankify addresses this challenge by offering an end-to-end retrieval and ranking ecosystem, enabling seamless experimentation across a wide range of retrieval, re-ranking, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models. Unlike existing retrieval and ranking frameworks that focus on a single aspect of the pipeline, Rankify is designed to be modular, SIGIR ’25, July 13–18, 2025, Padova, IT Abdallah et al.
