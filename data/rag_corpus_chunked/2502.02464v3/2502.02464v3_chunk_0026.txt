important to note that some datasets in Table 3 were either not officially recorded in previous studies or rely on different underlying corpora, making direct comparison difficult. Additionally, some datasets (e.g., ChroniclingAmericaQA) do not report retrieval accuracy as a standard Top-k metric, further compli- cating direct validation. Despite these variations, our results shown in Table 3 provide a comprehensive overview of BM25’s strengths and limitations. Table 4 presents the retrieval performance of various dense re- trievers across three benchmark datasets: NQ, WebQ, and Trivi- aQA. The results report Top-1, Top-5, Top-10, Top-20, Top-50, and Top-100 retrieval accuracy, providing insights into how different retrieval models rank relevant documents. Among the tested retriev- ers, dense retrieval methods such as DPR, MSS-DPR, and ColBERT consistently outperform retrievers like MSS and Contriever. MSS- DPR achieves the highest Top-1 accuracy, reaching 50.16% on NQ, 44.24% on WebQ, and 61.63% on TriviaQA, demonstrating the effec- tiveness of fine-tuned dense retrieval. Standard DPR also performs well, particularly on NQ and TriviaQA, where it reaches 48.67% and 57.47% Top-1 accuracy, respectively. ColBERT, which employs late- interaction ranking, shows competitive performance, particularly in higher recall settings (Top-50 and Top-100). Table 6: Performance of re-ranking methods on BM25- retrieved documents for NQ Test and WebQ Test. Results are reported in terms of Top-1, Top-5, Top-10, Top-20, and Top- 50 accuracy, highlighting the impact of various re-ranking models on retrieval effectiveness. Please note that some re- sults may differ from the original papers (e.g., UPR) as our experiments were conducted with the top 100 retrieved doc- uments, whereas the original studies used 1,000 documents for ranking.
