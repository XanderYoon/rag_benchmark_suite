In Listing 5, users can specify the retrieval corpus by setting index_type to msmarco or wiki, select the desired retriever model, and define the number of documents to retrieve. This flexibility allows researchers to experiment with different retrieval settings, optimizing their retrieval strategy based on the task requirements. SIGIR ’25, July 13–18, 2025, Padova, IT Abdallah et al. 3.4 Re-Ranking Models In information retrieval, two-stage pipelines are widely used to max- imize retrieval performance. The first stage involves retrieving a set of candidate documents using a computationally efficient retriever, followed by a second stage where these documents are re-ranked using a stronger, typically, neural network-based model. This re- ranking step enhances retrieval quality by considering deeper se- mantic relationships between the query and documents. While effective, re-ranking models vary significantly in their architec- tures, trade-offs, and implementations, making it challenging for users to
