Rankify: A Comprehensive Python Toolkit for Retrieval, Re-Ranking, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation Abdelrahman Abdallah University of Innsbruck Innsbruck, Tyrol, Austria abdelrahman.abdallah@uibk.ac.at Bhawna Piryani University of Innsbruck Innsbruck, Tyrol, Austria bhawna.piryani@uibk.ac.at Jamshid Mozafari University of Innsbruck Innsbruck, Tyrol, Austria jamshid.mozafari@uibk.ac.at Mohammed Ali University of Innsbruck Innsbruck, Tyrol, Austria Mohammed.ali@uibk.ac.at Adam Jatowt University of Innsbruck Innsbruck, Tyrol, Austria adam.jatowt@uibk.ac.at Abstract Retrieval, re-ranking, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) are critical components of modern applications in information re- trieval, question answering, or knowledge-based text generation. However, existing solutions are often fragmented, lacking a uni- fied framework that easily integrates these essential processes. The absence of a standardized implementation, coupled with the com- plexity of retrieval and re-ranking workflows, makes it challenging for researchers to compare and evaluate different approaches in a consistent environment. While existing toolkits such as Rerankers and RankLLM provide general-purpose reranking pipelines, they often lack the flexibility required for fine-grained experimentation and benchmarking. In response to these challenges, we introduce Rankify, a powerful and modular open-source toolkit designed to unify retrieval, re-ranking, and RAG within a cohesive framework. Rankify supports a wide range of retrieval techniques, including dense and sparse retrievers, while incorporating state-of-the-art re- ranking models to enhance retrieval quality. Additionally, Rankify includes a collection of pre-retrieved datasets to facilitate bench- marking, available at Huggingface1. To encourage adoption and ease of integration, we provide comprehensive documentation2, an open-source implementation on GitHub3, and a PyPI package for easy installation4. As a unified and lightweight framework,Rankify allows researchers and practitioners to advance retrieval and re- ranking methodologies while ensuring consistency, scalability, and ease of use. 1https://huggingface.co/datasets/abdoelsayed/reranking-datasets-light 2http://rankify.readthedocs.io/ 3https://github.com/DataScienceUIBK/rankify 4https://pypi.org/project/rankify/ Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial
