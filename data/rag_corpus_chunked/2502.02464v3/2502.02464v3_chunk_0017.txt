Rankify supports both pre-trained models from Hugging Face and API-based re-ranking models such as RankGPT, Cohere, and Jina Reranker. Users can select from a variety of models, includ- ing cross-encoders, T5-based ranking models, and late-interaction retrieval models like ColBERT. The flexibility to switch between different re-ranking strategies allows researchers and practitioners to optimize ranking performance based on their task requirements. 3.5 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Models Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances language models by integrating retrieval mechanisms, allowing them to generate responses based on dynamically retrieved documents
