The current version includes both sparse retrievers, such as BM25 [80], and dense retrievers, such as DPR [109], ANCE [104], and BGE [13], Contriever [36] and ColBERT [ 45]. The retrievers implemented in Rankify are accessible via a unified interface, where users can specify the retrieval method and parameters. Rankify allows users to retrieve documents efficiently using dif- ferent retrieval models. The retrievers can be applied to any dataset supported by Rankify, making it flexible for experimentation and benchmarking. Users can easily initialize a retriever and apply it to a list of query-document pairs, as demonstrated in Listing 5. 1 from rankify . dataset . dataset import Document , Question , Answer 2 from rankify . retrievers . retriever import Retriever 3 4 # Define sample documents 5 documents = [ 6 Document ( question = Question ( " the cast of a good day to die hard ?
