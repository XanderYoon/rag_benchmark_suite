while ensuring consistency in benchmarking. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: • Curated retrieval datasets and precomputed embed- dings: Rankify provides 40 datasets, each with 1,000 pre- retrieved documents per query, across various domains (QA, dialogue, entity linking, etc.). It also includes pre-computed Wikipedia and MS MARCO corpora for multiple retrievers, eliminating preprocessing overhead. • Diverse retriever and re-ranking support: Rankify inte- grates dense (DPR, ANCE, BPR, ColBERT, BGE, Contriever) and sparse (BM25) retrievers, along with 24 state-of-the-art re-ranking models, enabling seamless retrieval and ranking experimentation. • RAG integration and evaluation tools: Rankify bridges retrieval, re-ranking, and RAG by passing retrieved docu- ments to LLMs for evaluation. • Comprehensive evaluation tools: Rankify offers a di- verse range of evaluation metrics and tools for retrieval and question answering. The framework is accompanied by ex- tensive online documentation, making it easy for users to explore its features. Additionally,Rankify is freely available on PyPI and GitHub, ensuring accessibility for researchers and practitioners. 2 Related Work Research in information retrieval (IR), re-ranking, and retrieval- augmented generation (RAG) has progressed significantly over the past decade. Traditional retrieval models like BM25 [ 80] offered robust lexical matching capabilities but struggled with capturing semantic relationships. This limitation led to the development of dense retrieval methods [49], which leverage pre-trained neural encoders to represent queries and documents in a shared semantic space. Notable approaches, such as DPR [ 109], ANCE [104], and multi-vector models like ColBERT [ 45], have demonstrated sub- stantial improvements in retrieval effectiveness.
