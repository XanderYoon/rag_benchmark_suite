A key advantage of Rankify is its unified API, which abstracts implementation details and simplifies experimentation across dif- ferent models. Figure 2 and 3 illustrates the interactions between these modules within the pipeline. The framework is scalable, adapt- able, and suited for both research and real-world applications like search engines and question-answering systems. Rankify is open- source, actively maintained6, and accompanied by comprehensive documentation7 to support easy adoption for both
