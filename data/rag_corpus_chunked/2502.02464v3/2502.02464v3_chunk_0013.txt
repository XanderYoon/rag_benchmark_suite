Users can load their own datasets using load_dataset and load_dataset_qa functions. The load_dataset function is de- signed for structured datasets that include both queries and re- trieved documents. On the other hand, load_dataset_qa is in- tended for question-answering datasets that contain only queries and answers, allowing users to use them directly for retrieval tasks. The following examples demonstrate how users can load these datasets in Rankify: 1 from rankify . dataset . dataset import Dataset 2 r etr ie va l_ dat as et = Dataset . load_dataset ( " path / to / re tr ie va l_d at as et . json " ) 3 qa_dataset = Dataset . load_dataset_qa ( " path / to / qa_dataset . jsonl " ) Listing 4: Loading a dataset with documents and a QA-only dataset. 3.3 Retriever Models Rankify supports a diverse set of retriever models to facilitate document retrieval for various
