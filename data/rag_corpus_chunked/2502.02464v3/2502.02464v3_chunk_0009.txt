Built in Python, it leverages machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow [1], PyTorch [67], Spacy [34], and Pyserini [52] . The framework is available on PyPI5, making installation straightfor- ward: $ pip install rankify Rankify supports both precomputed and real-time retrieval workflows, allowing users to benchmark with pre-retrieved datasets or perform live document retrieval on large-scale corpora. The framework includes ready-to-use indices for Wikipedia and MS MARCO, eliminating the need for time-consuming indexing. The architecture of Rankify consists of four core modules: • Datasets: Provides standardized access to datasets like Nat- ural Questions, TriviaQA, and HotpotQA, with support for custom dataset creation. • Retrievers: Integrates diverse retrieval methods such as BM25, DPR, ANCE, BGE, and ColBERT, enabling flexible retrieval strategies. 5https://pypi.org/project/rankify/ Table 2: Summary of datasets used in Rankify. Categories include QA, Multi-Hop QA, Long-Form QA, Multiple-Choice, Entity-Linking, Slot Filling, Fact Verification, Dialog Genera- tion, Summarization, and Other specialized datasets.
