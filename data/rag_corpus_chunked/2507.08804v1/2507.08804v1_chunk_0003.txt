human reasoning, aiding decision-making in business, scientific research, law, ethics, and public policy [Deliu 2024, 2025; Tiron-Tudor et al. 2025]. AI-augmented reasoning systems are typically designed to optimize clarity, reduce cognitive strain, and enhance structured judgment through fact -checking, logical inference, and argument synthesis. While such systems improve efficiency, they may also weaken users’ ability to engage with uncertainty and complex, ill-structured problems [Simon 1973] – favoring quick resolutions and cognitive ease over intellectual struggle. However, cognitive science research suggests that intellectual growth emerges not from immediate clarity but from grappling with contradiction and uncertainty [Festinger 1957; Mercier & Sperber 2017]. Cognitive Dissonance (CD) – the psychological discomfort caused by conflicting beliefs – acts as a powerful driver of reflection, adaptive learning, and epistemic resilience. Individuals who can tolerate ambiguity and endure intellectual discomfort tend to develop stronger reasoning skills, more flexible thinking, and greater decision-making capacity in uncertain environments [Kahan 2017; Stanovich 2018]. Current AI systems, however, are designed to converge on a single “best” answer, often reinforcing confirmation bias by filtering information in ways that align with users’ pre-existing beliefs [Nickerson 1998]. This position paper argues that AI should not merely facilitate or support reasoning but actively challenge it. CD-AI is proposed as a novel framework in which AI deliberately delays convergence, presents logically coherent but contradictory perspectives, and nudges users toward self -driven synthesis. Rather than resolving ambiguity , CD -AI sustains it, encouraging users to navigate contradiction and complexity in ways that foster epistemic humility, intellectual flexibility, deeper critical engagement, and adaptability in complex decision environments. This reframing also gestures toward a philosophical alternative to technological determinism – one inspired by Nietzsche’s vision of the Übermensch [Nietzsche 1874, 1883]. In contrast to the passive acceptance of machine -dictated clarity, the Nietzschean ideal demands that we transcend
