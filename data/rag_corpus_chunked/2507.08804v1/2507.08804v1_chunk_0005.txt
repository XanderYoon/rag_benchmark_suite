their actions, or seek confirming information (Figure 1). For example, an environmentalist who frequently flies may either change their behavior, rationalize the choice, or downplay the environmental impact. Figure 1. Cognitive Dissonance as a Catalyst for Reflective Thinking. Though often perceived as unpleasant, CD plays a crucial role in critical thinking and learning. Research suggests that sustained engagement with contradictions – rather than quick resolution – enhances reasoning and fosters intellectual resilience [Mercier & Sperber 2017]. Traditional AI systems, however, are designed to minimize cognitive strain, limiting users’ exposure to this productive discomfort. In contrast, CD -AI proposes that AI should sustain and structure dissonance, guiding users through it – not around it – to promote deeper reflection and adaptive reasoning. 2.2 The Role of CD in Critical Thinking CD is foundational to critical thinking and epistemic humility. It helps individuals confront the limits of their knowledge and revise beliefs in light of new evidence. Research shows that those who can tolerate dissonance – and resist the urge for premature closure – develop more nuanced and adaptive reasoning skills [Stanovich 2018]. Structured dissonance also reduces cognitive biases. It mitigates confirmation bias (i.e., the tendency to seek only evidence that supports existing views) by forcing users to confront contradictions [Nickerson 1998; Bowes et al. 2020]. Similarly, 4 it challenges identity-protective cognition, where reasoning aligns with group loyalty rather than objective analysis, leading to resistance against factual correction [Kahan 2017]. When users engage with contradiction through guided exposure, they become more open to opposing perspectives and develop more reflective cognition. Yet, most current AI systems are optimized for cognitive ease (i.e., delivering fast, confirmatory answers that reinforce biases and discourage epistemic struggle). CD-AI proposes a shift. Rather than resolving tension prematurely, AI should introduce controlled cognitive dissonance – deliberately sustaining contradiction to
