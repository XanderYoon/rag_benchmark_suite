request resolution assistance if they feel overwhelmed. By balancing structured dissonance with practical usability, CD-AI can enhance reasoning without leading to decision paralysis. 5.2 User Autonomy: Ensuring Free Intellectual Exploration CD-AI’s deliberate shaping of reasoning paths raises concerns about user autonomy. If AI guides users toward particular contradictions and selectively delays resolution, does it subtly influence their reasoning in ways they do not control? The potential for algorithmic steering – where users are nudged toward specific conclusions based on controlled exposure to opposing arguments – poses a significant ethical dilemma. For example, in a debate on universal basic income (UBI), CD -AI could theoretically frame counterarguments in ways that subtly favor one position, leading to concerns about covert persuasion rather than unbiased facilitation. Even if the AI does not explicitly endorse a stance, its choice of which contradictions to emphasize and how long to sustain dissonance could unintentionally shape user conclusions. To protect intellectual freedom, CD-AI should incorporate: (i) transparency mechanisms (users should be informed about how CD-AI selects and presents opposing arguments, ensuring they understand its reasoning model); (ii) user-directed argument exploration (instead of AI pre -selecting contradictions, users should have the ability to request specific counterarguments or explore alternative viewpoints); and (iii) non-predictive reasoning models (unlike conventional AI, which optimizes for a best answer, CD -AI should facilitate reasoning exploration without steering users toward a predetermined endpoint). By prioritizing user autonomy, CD-AI can function as a neutral dialectical partner rather than a manipulative persuader. 5.3 The Risk of Manipulation and Misuse CD-AI’s ability to sustain uncertainty, structure contradictions, and delay resolution presents a dual -use dilemma – while it can be used to foster intellectual resilience, it could also be exploited for cognitive manipulation. A significant risk i s epistemic confusion, where individuals begin doubting legitimate knowledge sources
