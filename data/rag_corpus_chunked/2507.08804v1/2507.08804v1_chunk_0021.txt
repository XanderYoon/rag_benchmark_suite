with traditional AI responses and independent reasoning could d etermine its long -term benefits for intellectual flexibility. Additionally, CD -AI must be adaptable to individual cognitive styles – adjusting dissonance intensity based on user tolerance for ambiguity – to ensure engagement without overwhelming users. Neu roscientific research may help identify optimal levels of cognitive discomfort that enhance learning. CD-AI requires a reasoning model that integrates philosophy, psychology, and computational logic to facilitate structured debate rather than simple knowledge retrieval. Research should explore how formal logic, argumentation theory, and probabilistic reasoning can be embedded into CD-AI to support multi-step dialectical interactions. Testing CD-AI in education, media literacy, and decision-making fields will be crucial in evaluating its usability and societal impact. Cross- cultural studies should assess how different epistemological traditions shape user engagement with structured contradictions. Beyond cognitive and technical challenges, CD -AI raises ethical concerns. Prolonged dissonance could lead to epistemic anxiety, while bad actors could manipulate public reasoning by strategically sustaining doubt around key issues [Lewandowsky et al. 2017; Tiron-Tudor et al. 2024]. Research must examine how CD -AI can be safeguarded against epistemic exploitation while remaining an effective tool for intellectual development. Finally, a new AI governance model – Human-Governing-the-Loop (HGTL) – should be explored, where users control how AI presents contradictions, sustains dissonance, and resolves tension [Tiron-Tudor & Deliu 2022 ]. This paradigm ensures AI remains a reasoning facilitator rather than an autonomous arbiter. CD-AI represents a fundamental shift in HAII, redefining AI as a dialectical partner rather than a passive answer provider. However, rigorous research is needed to refine its cognitive, technical, and ethical dimensions. By ensuring CD- AI fosters critical thinking, intellectual humility, and resilie nce against misinformation, it could become a powerful tool for enhancing human reasoning in an era of increasing complexity. 7 CONCLUSION:
