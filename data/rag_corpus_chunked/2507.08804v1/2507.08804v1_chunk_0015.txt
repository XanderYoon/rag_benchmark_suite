answers to facilitating deep reasoning through dialectical engagement. Beyond ethics, politics, law, and science, CD-AI has broader applications: media literacy (helping users recognize manipulative reasoning tactics in political discourse), negotiation training (improving strategic thinking by requiring users to engage with opposing viewpoints), or business strategy (challenging corporate decision-makers to assess multiple conflicting market forecasts before making high-stakes choices). As AI becomes increasingly embedded in decision -making, education, and public discourse, its role should not be limited to providing quick solutions. Instead, AI should function as a catalyst for deeper reflection, helping humans navigate complexity with i ntellectual humility and adaptability. CD -AI offers a model for this transformation, ensuring that AI enhances rather than replaces human cognitive resilience. 5 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS OF CD-AI While CD -AI holds promise for enhancing critical thinking, reducing ideological rigidity, and fostering epistemic adaptability, its intentional induction and maintenance of cognitive discomfort raises significant ethical concerns. Designing AI systems to w ithhold resolution, challenge entrenched beliefs, and induce temporary uncertainty must be approached with care to avoid unintended psychological and social consequences. As AI systems increasingly mediate human decision -making, researchers and policymakers must confront the ethical duality of digital transformation, ensuring that such systems promote intellectual growth without exploiting epistemic vulnerabilities [Tiron-Tudor et al. 2024]. Key ethical risks include decision paralysis, erosion of user autonomy, potential for cognitive manipulation, and bias in AI -driven reasoning. To ensure CD -AI remains a constructive tool rather than a source of distress or coercion, robust safeguards must be designed, implemented, and continuously evaluated. 5.1 The Risk of Decision Paralysis and Cognitive Overload One major concern is the possibility of decision paralysis, where users become so overwhelmed by conflicting information that they struggle to make choices. Cognitive science research suggests that when contradictions persist without resolution, individuals may
