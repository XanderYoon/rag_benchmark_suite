tolerated CD, CD-AI guides them toward a structured synthesis process. Rather than offering a final answer, it prompts users to construct their own conclusions, integrating insights from both perspectives. CD-AI encourages users to: (i) formulate a nuanced stance that acknowledges the strengths and weaknesses of both arguments; (ii) identify gaps in their knowledge where further investigation is needed; and (iii) consider real-world implications – how their conclusion would function in practice? 7 By requiring users to actively engage in synthesis, CD -AI reinforces intellectual humility – the recognition that knowledge is always provisional and subject to refinement. This aligns with Socratic questioning techniques, which foster deeper self-inquiry and dialectical reasoning [Paul & Elder 2019]. 3.3 Adaptive Difficulty: Tailoring CD to the User Not all users respond to CD in the same way – some thrive on intellectual conflict, while others experience frustration or decision paralysis. To ensure that dissonance remains a productive challenge rather than an overwhelming burden, CD-AI includes adaptive difficulty mechanisms that: (i) assess the user’s tolerance for ambiguity based on engagement patterns; (ii) dynamically adjust the level of contradiction complexity, scaling difficulty for experienced critical thinkers while providing gentler scaffolding for those less tolerant of dissonance; and (iii) monitor signs of frustration or disengagement and offer assistance if needed. This ensures that CD-AI remains challenging yet accessible, fostering intellectual growth without overwhelming the user. 3.4 Redefining AI’s Role in Human Reasoning CD-AI represents a paradigm shift in HAII. While traditional AI optimizes for certainty, efficiency, and quick resolutions, CD-AI prioritizes intellectual resilience, deep learning, and cognitive flexibility. By deliberately sustaining and structuring dissonance, CD-AI shifts AI’s role from a passive assistant to an active dialectical partner, fostering stronger reasoning skills and adaptability in decision-making. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into education, policymaking, and professional reasoning, ensuring that
