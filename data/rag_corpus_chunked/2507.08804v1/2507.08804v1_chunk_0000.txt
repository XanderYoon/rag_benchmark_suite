Cognitive Dissonance Artificial Intelligence (CD-AI): The Mind at War with Itself. Harnessing Discomfort to Sharpen Critical Thinking Delia Deliu* Accounting & Audit Department, Faculty of Economics & Business Administration, West University of Timişoara, Romania; delia.deliu@e-uvt.ro AI-augmented systems are traditionally designed to streamline human decision -making by minimizing cognitive load, clarifying arguments, and optimizing efficiency. However, in a world where algorithmic certainty risks becoming an Orwellian tool of epi stemic control, true intellectual growth demands not passive acceptance but active struggle. Drawing on the dystopian visions of George Orwell and Philip K. Dick – where reality is unstable, perception malleable, and truth contested – this paper introduces Cognitive Dissonance AI (CD-AI): a novel framework that deliberately sustains uncertainty rather than resolving it. CD-AI does not offer closure, but compels users to navigate contradictions, challenge biases, and wrestle with competing truths. By delaying resolution and promoting d ialectical engagement, CD-AI enhances reflective reasoning, epistemic humility, critical thinking, and adaptability in complex decision -making. This paper examines the theoretical foundations of the approach, presents an implementation model, explores its application i n domains such as ethics, law, politics, and science, and addresses key ethical concer ns – including decision paralysis, erosion of user autonomy, cognitive manipulation, and bias in AI reasoning . In reimagining AI as an engine of doubt rather than a deliverer of certainty, CD -AI challenges dominant paradigms of AI-augmented reasoning and offers a new vision – one in which AI sharpens the mind not by resolving conflict, but by sustaining it. Rather than reinforcing Huxleyan complacency or pacifying the user into intellectual conformi ty, CD-AI echoes Nietzsche’s vision of the Übermensch – urging users to transcend passive cognition through active epistemic struggle.
