partner rather than a manipulative persuader. 5.3 The Risk of Manipulation and Misuse CD-AI’s ability to sustain uncertainty, structure contradictions, and delay resolution presents a dual -use dilemma – while it can be used to foster intellectual resilience, it could also be exploited for cognitive manipulation. A significant risk i s epistemic confusion, where individuals begin doubting legitimate knowledge sources due to prolonged engagement with conflicting claims. This is a known tactic in political propaganda and corporate disinformation campaigns, where excessive exposure to contradictory claims creates public skepticism toward consensus [Lewandowsky et al. 2017]. 11 For example, a climate change denial group could deploy CD-AI to sustain artificial controversy, casting doubt on well-established climate science. In a similar manner, an authoritarian government could manipulate CD -AI to prolong dissonance around democratic principles, reducing trust in democratic institutions (Costello et al., 2020). To prevent malicious use, CD-AI should integrate: (i) fact-verification safeguards (CD-AI should encourage dialectical engagement while preventing false equivalence between empirical facts and misinformation [Rani et al., 2025]); (ii) accountability structures (ethical guidelines should govern who controls AI -driven reasoning models and how they are deployed); and (iii) independent oversight (CD -AI development should be subject to external ethical review, ensuring it remains a tool for intellectual enhancement rather than epistemic destabilization). By implementing robust ethical constraints, CD-AI can be used to enhance knowledge rather than distort it. 5.4 Fairness and Bias: Avoiding Ideological Reinforcement Another challenge in designing CD -AI is ensuring fairness and avoiding ideological bias. While CD -AI aims to sustain opposing arguments, there is always a risk that certain perspectives may be given greater weight due to biases in training data, argument weighting, or developer assumptions. For example, in political reasoning, CD-AI must ensure that it does not systematically favor one ideological stance. Similarly, in
