than a source of distress or coercion, robust safeguards must be designed, implemented, and continuously evaluated. 5.1 The Risk of Decision Paralysis and Cognitive Overload One major concern is the possibility of decision paralysis, where users become so overwhelmed by conflicting information that they struggle to make choices. Cognitive science research suggests that when contradictions persist without resolution, individuals may experience anxiety, frustration, and reduced cognitive efficiency [Schwartz 2005]. This is particularly 10 problematic in high -stakes environments, such as medical diagnosis, legal reasoning, and emergency decision -making, where excessive deliberation could cause dangerous delays in action. Uncritical reliance on AI automation can erode human judgment, while excessive AI -induced uncertainty may lead to cognitive fatigue [Deliu 2024, 2025; Tiron-Tudor et al. 2024]. In legal settings, for instance, a lawyer using CD-AI to analyze contradictory precedents may struggle to confidently formulate an argument, while a doctor confronted with competing treatment options might hesitate, leading to delays in critical interventions. To prevent cognitive overload, CD -AI must be context -sensitive, adjusting the intensity and duration of CD based on the decision environment. Key safeguards include: (i) time-sensitive dissonance resolution (in fields where swift decisions are necessary, CD -AI should gradually reduce dissonance over time, converging on actionable recommendations while preserving critical scrutiny); (ii) adaptive difficulty scaling (CD -AI should assess the user’s tolerance for ambiguity and adjust contradiction complexity accordingly); and (iii) clear exit strategies (users should have the ability to request resolution assistance if they feel overwhelmed. By balancing structured dissonance with practical usability, CD-AI can enhance reasoning without leading to decision paralysis. 5.2 User Autonomy: Ensuring Free Intellectual Exploration CD-AI’s deliberate shaping of reasoning paths raises concerns about user autonomy. If AI guides users toward particular contradictions and selectively delays resolution, does it subtly influence their reasoning in ways
