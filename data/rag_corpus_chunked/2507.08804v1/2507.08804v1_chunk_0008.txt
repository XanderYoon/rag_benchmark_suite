alternative vision: instead of being a truth-delivery system, AI should act as a catalyst for intellectual struggle, engaging users in dialectical reasoning. By sustaining CD, AI can help users develop greater cognitive flexibility, stronger argumentation skills, and a more nuanced approach to complex problems. This marks a fundamental shift in HAII, transforming AI from an answer provider into a thinking partner in deeper intellectual engagement – an active co-pilot in navigating complexity, ambiguity, and contradiction. 3 HOW CD-AI WORKS Unlike conventional AI, which typically delivers a single, best -fitting answer, CD -AI deliberately presents opposing viewpoints that are equally well -supported by logical reasoning and evidence. This forces users to engage with contradictions rather than automatically accepting a pre-filtered conclusion. For example, if a user asks, “Should AI be granted legal personhood?” , a traditional AI might summarize the prevailing legal stance, whereas CD-AI would present two fully developed arguments: - Pro: AI should be legally recognized because it demonstrates autonomy and can engage in contractual obligations; and - Con: AI lacks moral agency and accountability, making personhood status both inappropriate and risky. To prevent strawman reasoning (where one side is unfairly weakened), CD -AI ensures that both perspectives are presented in their strongest form, compelling users to actively confront their biases and critically evaluate competing arguments [Mercier & Sperber 2017). 3.1 Withholding Immediate Resolution One of the key challenges in fostering deep reasoning is that humans have a natural tendency to seek closure. Humans seek cognitive closure, striving to eliminate uncertainty and ambiguity as quickly as possible [Kruglanski 2013 ]. When 6 confronted with contradictions, individuals often rush to resolve them – rejecting discomfort by clinging to familiar beliefs or dismissing opposing views. CD-AI prevents premature resolution and disrupts this pattern. Instead of delivering fast conclusions, it intentionally withholds
