tendency to seek closure. Humans seek cognitive closure, striving to eliminate uncertainty and ambiguity as quickly as possible [Kruglanski 2013 ]. When 6 confronted with contradictions, individuals often rush to resolve them – rejecting discomfort by clinging to familiar beliefs or dismissing opposing views. CD-AI prevents premature resolution and disrupts this pattern. Instead of delivering fast conclusions, it intentionally withholds resolution, holding users in a productive pause. By doing so, it transforms dissonance from something to avoid into something to explore. Rather than providing an immediate answer, the AI engages the user in an iterative reasoning process, encouraging self- examination and deeper thought. In this context, after presenting two conflicting arguments, CD-AI might ask: - (Q1) Which argument challenges your existing beliefs the most, and why? - (Q2) What counterarguments could strengthen the position you initially disagreed with? - (Q3) How would your stance change if new evidence emerged? This design reframes contradiction as a cognitive engine, not an error. By compelling users to reflect before deciding, CD-AI helps shift reasoning from uncertainty to implication, and in that tension, generates insight (Figure 3). Figure 3. Withholding Closure – How CD-AI Supports Epistemic Engagement through Structured Dissonance. Ultimately, b y compelling users to delay forming a final opinion, CD -AI fosters critical reflection and dialectical thinking, ensuring that dissonance remains productive rather than frustrating [Bjork & Bjork 2011]. 3.2 Encouraging Synthesis Through Self-Reflection Once users have engaged with conflicting perspectives and tolerated CD, CD-AI guides them toward a structured synthesis process. Rather than offering a final answer, it prompts users to construct their own conclusions, integrating insights from both perspectives. CD-AI encourages users to: (i) formulate a nuanced stance that acknowledges the strengths and weaknesses of both arguments; (ii) identify gaps in their knowledge where further investigation is needed; and (iii)
