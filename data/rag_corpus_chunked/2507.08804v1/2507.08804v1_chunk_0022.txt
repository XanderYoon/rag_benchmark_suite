shift in HAII, redefining AI as a dialectical partner rather than a passive answer provider. However, rigorous research is needed to refine its cognitive, technical, and ethical dimensions. By ensuring CD- AI fosters critical thinking, intellectual humility, and resilie nce against misinformation, it could become a powerful tool for enhancing human reasoning in an era of increasing complexity. 7 CONCLUSION: CD-AI AND THE FUTURE OF AI-AUGMENTED REASONING AI has traditionally been designed to optimize decision-making, clarify information, and minimize cognitive strain, but as it becomes more embedded in human reasoning, a more dialectical and thought -provoking interaction model is needed. This paper introdu ced CD-AI as a novel approach that sustains cognitive discomfort, presents structured contradictions, 13 and fosters deeper critical engagement. Unlike conventional AI, which passively retrieves information, CD -AI functions as a dialectical reasoning partner, enhancing epistemic humility, intellectual adaptability, and the ability to navigate complexity and ambiguity. This position paper outlined CD -AI’s theoretical foundations, implementation framework, applications, ethical considerations, and future research directions, demonstrating its transformative potential in AI -augmented reasoning. Drawing on cognitive psychology, philosophy, and neuroscience, it established that structured CD is crucial for intellectual growth. A three -stage model was proposed, ensuring that users actively engage with contradictions before forming conclusions, fostering nuanced and resilient thinking. CD-AI’s potential applications span ethics, political discourse, law, and scientific discovery, showing its ability to enhance critical thinking in high -stakes environments. To mitigate risks such as decision paralysis and cognitive overload, the paper proposed adaptive dissonance scaling, user autonomy protections, and transparency mechanisms. Additionally, key research priorities were identified, including empirical validation, personalized reasoning models, interdisciplinary AI architectures, an d real-world implementation studies to refine CD-AI and assess its impact. The introduction of CD -AI marks a fundamental shift in AI -human reasoning, challenging the assumption
