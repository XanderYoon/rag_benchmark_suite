least one PMID in our dataset to ensure they can be answered using our subset. Indexing and Retrieval Systems.We compare three stor- age and query systems: Elasticsearch, FAISS, and MongoDB. MongoDB2, a NoSQL document database, supports full- text search with TF-IDF-like scoring in its self-hosted version. While BM25 ranking is available in MongoDB Atlas Search, it is a cloud-only service and was not used. Elasticsearch3, built on Apache Lucene, uses BM25 ranking and inverted indexing for efficient text-based retrieval. FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) optimizes dense vector similarity search, commonly used in NLP and recom- mendation systems [12]. We deployed FAISS using a Flask- based server with a FlatL2 index for exhaustive search. Metrics: We evaluateindexing speedandresponse timeon 2.4M PubMed papers to determine the best trade-off between efficiency and retrieval performance. Retrieval Methods.Based on recall and precision, we evaluate four retrieval methods—BM25, BioBERT, MedCPT, and a hybrid approach (BM25 + MedCPT). BM25 [13] is a ranking algorithm that improves upon TF- IDF [14] by incorporating term frequency, document length normalization, and inverse document frequency. It ranks doc- uments based on query relevance using a probabilistic scor- ing function. We implemented BM25 in Elasticsearch, with stopword removal for improved efficiency. BioBERT [7] is a domain-specific adaptation of BERT [15], pre-trained on PubMed abstracts and PMC articles to enhance biomedical text understanding. We use BioBERT to encode PubMed abstracts into semantic vectors via FAISS, computing document-query similarity with squared Euclidean distance. MedCPT [8] is a contrastive learning-based retriever trained on 255M PubMed query-article interactions. It consists of a query encoder, document encoder, and a cross-encoder reranker. The cross- encoder refines retrieval results by reranking top candidates based on query-document contextual interactions.
