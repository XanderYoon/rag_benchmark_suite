retrieval, limiting its effectiveness in large-scale biomedical QA. Based on these results, we selected Elasticsearch for full- text retrieval and FAISS for semantic vector search. Despite its slower indexing speed, Elasticsearch provides a robust text- based search framework, while FAISS offers superior response times for vector-based queries.

Document Relevancy Table II summarizes the retrievers’ performance. The Hy- brid Retriever achieved the highest recall (0.567), balancing efficiency and accuracy. BM25 exhibited strong precision but lower recall. MedCPT improved semantic retrieval but underperformed in recall, while BioBERT had the weakest results due to a lack of fine-tuning for question-answering tasks. Note that a low recall score does not necessarily indicate incorrect retrieval; rather, it means that the retrieved documents may not be included in the BioASQ-curated set.

Answer Correctness of the RAG System (End-to-End) ForBM25, the query is processed using term-based re- trieval, ranking documents based on query term occurrence. The topkranked documents are embedded into the LLM context for response generation. ForMedCPT, the query is encoded into a vector and compared against document embeddings for similarity search. The retrieved documents are reranked by a cross-encoder, and only those with positive relevance scores are used for response generation. ForHybrid Retrieval, BM25 first retrieveskcandidate documents, which are then reranked by MedCPT’s cross-encoder. Only relevant documents are passed to the LLM.
