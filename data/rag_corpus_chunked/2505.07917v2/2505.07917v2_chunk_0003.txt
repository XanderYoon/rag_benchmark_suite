Offline phase: biomedical doc- uments are processed, indexed, and stored in a vector store. Online phase: users ask questions, for which a retriever re- trieves relevant documents that are appended with the question and fed to an LLM. Based on the question and context, the LLM generates an answer the PubMed IDs it used. Retrieval-Augmented Generation enhances the capabilities of LLMs by incorporating external data and grounding responses in verifiable and up-to-date information. This en- sures that outputs incorporate relevant biomedical knowledge from sources such as PubMed [10], improving accuracy and transparency. Figure 1 illustrates our biomedical QA system based on RAG, which consists of two main phases: an offline phase for indexing biomedical literature and an online phase for retrieving relevant documents and generating responses. In the offline phase, biomedical documents are preprocessed and indexed into a vector store (dense vectors) and/or an inverted index (sparse vectors) for efficient retrieval. The choices directly affect retrieval speed and system scalability. During the online phase, users submit biomedical queries, which the retriever processes to fetch relevant documents. These retrieved documents, along with the query, are provided as context to an LLM, ensuring responses remain grounded in authoritative biomedical sources. The used sources are cited (PMIDs) and provided as references to users. In this setting, system performance should be evaluated based on three key aspects, as highlighted in Figure 1: (1) indexing and query time, which measures retrieval efficiency; (2) relevance of retrieved documents, ensuring the most informative sources are selected; and (3) answer correctness, verifying that the LLM- generated response aligns with biomedical evidence.
