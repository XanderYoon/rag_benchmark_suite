ever, LLMs can produce factual inaccuracies, lack specific domain knowledge, and lack verifiability [2]. A major con- cern ishallucination, where LLMs generate factually in- correct responses due to their probabilistic nature. These hallucinations, together with a lack of verifiability, are par- ticularly problematic in healthcare, where misinformation can lead to serious consequences. To mitigate these risks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)systems leverage ex- ternal knowledge sources at inference time by selecting rel- evant documents from a data store to enhance accuracy, transparency, and traceability [3]. Despite the potential of biomedical RAG systems, exist- ing solutions often suffer from limited scalability, poor re- producibility, and suboptimal retrieval performance on large datasets such as PubMed. Existing benchmarks for medical question answering, such as MedExpQA [4] and MIRAGE [5], lack reproducibility and scalable retrieval solutions.

However,hybrid approaches that integrate both techniques remain under-investigated, especially from a system perspective: the inherent trade-offs between retrieval strategies, their indexing and response times, and the resulting generator accuracy are crucial for practical RAG applications and have been largely unexplored. Hybrid retrieval methods combine the strengths of sparse and dense retrieval: aproba- bilistic retriever(e.g., BM25) efficiently reduces the search space by filtering a large corpus, while aneural reranker (e.g., MedCPT’s cross-encoder) refines document rankings based on semantic relevance. This two-step approach balances computational efficiency and retrieval precision, mitigating the limitations of stand-alone methods. Although hybrid retrieval has been explored in general NLP tasks [9],its application in large-scale biomedical QA remains limited, particularly in real-world implementations. Developing an effective biomed- ical QA system requires addressing several challenges: (i) Efficient Retrieval
