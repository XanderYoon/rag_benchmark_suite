MedCPT’s cross-encoder) refines document rankings based on semantic relevance. This two-step approach balances computational efficiency and retrieval precision, mitigating the limitations of stand-alone methods. Although hybrid retrieval has been explored in general NLP tasks [9],its application in large-scale biomedical QA remains limited, particularly in real-world implementations. Developing an effective biomed- ical QA system requires addressing several challenges: (i) Efficient Retrieval at Scale: Processing millions of biomedi- cal documents under reasonableindexing timeswhile main- taininglow-latency retrieval; (ii)Relevance Optimization: Improvingdocument rankingby integrating lexical retrieval with neural reranking; (iii)Context Integration: Structuring retrieved documents effectively to generatefactually accurate and verifiable responses. This work presents ascalable and reproducibleRAG system for biomedical QA, systematically evaluating hybrid retrieval strategies. The key contributions include: •Hybrid Retrieval Approach: A two-stage retrieval pipeline that integrates BM25 (lexical retrieval) with MedCPT’s cross-encoder (semantic reranking), improv- ing recall and precision. •Scalability and Performance Analysis: Comparative evaluation of three common methods and systems, MongoDB, Elasticsearch and FAISS, for large-scale doc- ument retrieval efficiency. •Reproducibility and Transparency: Explicit citation of retrieved documents using PubMed IDs to ensure traceability in biomedical QA. arXiv:2505.07917v2 [cs.IR] 13 Jan 2026 This work advances scalable and reproducible biomedical QA systems, enhancing their real-world applicability in clini- cal and research environments.
