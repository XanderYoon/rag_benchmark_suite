method retrieves rele- vant documents. Sincerecallis critical for ensuring compre- hensive retrieval, we prioritize methods that maximize relevant document retrieval while maintaining highprecision. Text Generation.For text generation, we experiment with different prompting strategies for OpenAI’s GPT-3.5-turbo (API version May 2024, temperature=0), ensuring that gen- erated responses are accurate and contextually relevant. Given the biomedical domain’s strict accuracy requirements, we fo- cus on structured prompts that enhance factual consistency. We experimented with multiple prompting approaches, following best practices in medical NLP [5], [16]. Due to resource con- straints, we evaluated GPT-3.5, with limited testing of GPT- 4. Observations showed no significant differences in output quality. As illustrated in Figure 2, our final prompt consists of three components: (1) a system prompt with task-specific instructions, (2) a user query, and (3) retrieved documents with PubMed IDs (PMIDs), titles and content.

Indexing and Query Time Table I summarizes the performance of Elasticsearch, FAISS, and MongoDB. Elasticsearch excels in full-text re- trieval but is less efficient for semantic vector search, which FAISS optimizes for. However, due to their complex data management and indexing mechanisms, MongoDB and Elas- ticsearch exhibit the slowest indexing speeds. MongoDB, while providing a flexible NoSQL document storage solution, uses TF-IDF-based text ranking in its self- hosted version, which leads to significantly slower query response times compared to Elasticsearch and FAISS. The self- hosted MongoDB lacks efficient semantic retrieval, limiting its effectiveness in large-scale biomedical QA. Based on these results, we selected Elasticsearch for full- text retrieval and FAISS for semantic vector search. Despite its slower indexing speed, Elasticsearch provides a robust text- based search framework, while FAISS offers superior response times for vector-based queries.
