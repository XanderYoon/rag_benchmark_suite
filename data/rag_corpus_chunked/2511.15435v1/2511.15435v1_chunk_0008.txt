to maximize the adversarial effect. Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) [9] generates adversarial examples by adding a small perturbation in the direction of the gradient of the loss function with respect to the input. The Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) [25] is an iterative variant of FGSM that re- fines the perturbation through multiple steps. The Carlini and Wagner (CW) attack [4] employs optimization tech- niques to find adversarial examples that achieve best attack while being close to the original input. Gray-box [3, 15] and black-box [5] attacks have limited knowledge about the at- tacked model, and rely on transferability or surrogate mod- els to craft effective perturbations. In this paper, we focus on white-box attack on images, assuming full access to the open-source retriever in MRAG pipeline. 3. Method 3.1. MRAG Preliminaries and Problem Definition A multimodal RAG pipeline consists of a retrieverR, a gen- eratorGand an external knowledge baseKB. When a user inputs an imageIand a text queryT, the retrieverRfirst re- trieve top-k augmented knowledge fromKB. Then the gen- eratorGgenerates an answer using the multimodal query along with k augmented knowledge. The retrieval process follows the DPR [16] structure, which comprises an image encoderE I and a text encoderE T . The encoders embed input and knowledge into a common semantic space. A similarity-based retrieval can be conducted by calculating and ranking the distance between the input and knowledge in this semantic space. For each query, the top-k knowledge embeddings with highest similarity are retrieved as results. The multimodal embedding of a user query is obtained by summing the corresponding image and text embeddings, i.e.,E I (I) +E T (T). The knowledge embedding is de- pended on its modality. For text corpus, each passageK t’s embedding isE T (Kt). For multimodal KB, each image- text pair(Ki, Kt)’s embedding isEI
