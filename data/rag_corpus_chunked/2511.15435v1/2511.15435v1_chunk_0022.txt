' LLaVA adv answer: 'Someone might go to this place to enjoy the winter sportsactivities offered, such as sledding, skiing, snowboarding, and skating. ' Question: Why might someone go to this place? GT answers: business, nyc, shop Retrieval Adversarial Image Figure 5. An example showing the original image, the adversarial images as inputs to retriever and generator, as well as the clean and adversarial augmented knowledge, along with the generated answer based on them. The example demonstrates the attack effect of our hierarchical method within imperceptible disruption. being imperceptible. 4.4.3. Case studies We provide a case study in Figure 5. This example shows the attack effect of our hierarchical method under the per- turbation budgetϵ= 8. As shown in the example, with the original query image without noise, the retriever returns augmented knowledge that are closely related to answering the question. The generator provides a correct answer ac- cordingly. However, with added imperceptible noise, the retriever returns irrelevant augmented knowledge that are about winter sports. With the disruptions, the final predic- tion of the generator is wrong and unreasonable. 5. Conclusion In this paper, we proposed a novel attack method against MRAG pipeline that focused solely on image inputs. With hierarchical
