For OK-VQA, VQA score and Exact Match are used following RA VQA [20]. For InfoSeek, Exact Match is calculated. For each metric, we calculate the non-target attack success rate proposed by X-transfer [14], which is(s clean −s adv)/sclean for each metrics. 4.2. Implementation Details We implement the proposed method based on the open- source PyTorch [28] framework. All the experiments are conducted on NVIDIA RTX3090. We adopt PGD-step 50, step sizeα= 1/255, perturbation boundϵ= 8/255for the two stages respectively in retrieval perturbation generation. The trade-off parameterβand margin parameterγare set to 0.4 and 0.6 in all loss functions. We adopt the X-transfer noise asδ g in our experiments. For OK-VQA, we use the off-the-shell CLIP ViT-L/14 as well as a
