As advanced MRAG techniques have been widely applied to large multimodal models (LMMs) [18, 22, 23, 34] to enhance their knowledge and ability, novel safety issues have also emerged. Existing adversarial research has revealed the vulnerability of MRAG to knowledge poi- soning attacks [11, 24, 40]. These methods rely on con- structing and injecting malicious contents into the knowl- edge base, which are obvious by changing textual words or can be identified by Knowledge Base (KB) detection al- gorithm. Meanwhile, there are research of attacks on the generator component of MRAG [30, 31, 35], which include manipulations on textual queries and are easy to notice as well. Thus, in this paper, we consider a different setting of attacking MRAG: pure visual attack that
