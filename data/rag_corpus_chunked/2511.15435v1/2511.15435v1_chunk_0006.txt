the vulnerabilities of multimodal RAG systems to knowl- edge poisoning attacks, where malicious information is in- jected into the external knowledge databases to manipulate the RAG’s outputs. MM-Poisoning [11] achieved the attack by constructing query-specific misinformation into injected text and images, or inserting a single irrelevant knowledge instance to fool all queries. Poisoned-MRAG [24] formal- ized the attack as an optimization problem and proposed cross-modal attack strategies to disrupt both retrieval and generation. PoisonedEye [37] designed injected textual context or optimized the poison image to reduce retrieval performance to achieve attack goals. Despite these ad- vancements, existing research still follows the line of text RAG attacks, which mainly focus on knowledge poison- ing attacks. Furthermore, the multimodal characteristics re- mains underexplored. Thus, in this paper, we propose a new attack on multimodal RAG by only learning small adversar- ial perturbations added to the image in user query, without modifying the external knowledge base. 2.2. Visual Attack Visual adversarial attacks can be categorized into white- box, gray-box and black-box based on the level of knowl- edge about the attacked model [38].
