directly aﬀects the following retrieval and ﬁnal response generatio n. How- ever, user intent comprehension could be challenging espec ially under long dialogue context. R 3AG is expected to help users clar- ify their information needs during the interaction process. Besides, R3AG should have the capability to split complex queries into s im- ple queries to accomplish user demands.

Query & Knowledge Encoding. The eﬀectiveness of RAG de- pends heavily on the representation learning of both querie s and knowledge. Mainstream methods use pre-trained feature ext rac- tors [10, 17] to encode them, while there could be a misalignm ent between diverse knowledge and user queries. Currently, ﬁne-turning based query-knowledge encoding plays an important role in R AG. However, there still lacks suﬃcient exploration to conduct more ef- fective query & knowledge encoding for R3AG, especially in terms of eﬃcient ﬁne-tuning to support knowledge updates. RAG for Complex Documents.RAG systems aim to deliver knowl- edge chunks to improve LLM generation. However, existing RA G methods could encounter diﬃculties to parse complex docume nts with embedded tables and ﬁgures. How to parse complex tabula r knowledge is still an open research question. Besides, the c hunks division strategy also aﬀects response generation. Too large chunks introduce irrelevant information while small chunks could lead to incomplete knowledge. In addition, multi-hop document ret rieval is also a challenge. The above three issues need to be further inves- tigated to conduct R 3AG. Reliable Retrieval for RAG. The inclusion of noisy or contradic- tory information during retrieval can signiﬁcantly impair the per- formance of existing RAG models. There has been growing
