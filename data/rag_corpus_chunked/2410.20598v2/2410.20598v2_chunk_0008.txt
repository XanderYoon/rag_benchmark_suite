The decision to incl ude this session will depend on the availability of panelists at tending SIGIR-AP and the number of accepted research papers. Contingency Plan. To ensure a successful workshop, our contin- gency plan identiﬁes key requirements (venue, speakers, materials) and assesses risks. We will have backup venues, alternate speakers, and a ready team for onsite support. A designated lead will oversee a communication plan, with speciﬁc roles for last-minute or ganiz- ers to manage registration, technical support, and logisti cs. 3.3 Selection Process Each invited speaker should be highly esteemed within the co m- munity. Invitations should be agreed upon by all organizers with- out any disagreement. The workshop accepts paper submissio ns via a standard peer-review process, expects 6 ∼10 paper submis- sions, and accepts 3 ∼4 papers. Each submission is evaluated by at least two members of the program committee. The senior PCs or workshop organizers will make the ﬁnal decision. Authors will receive detailed review comments and a notiﬁcation letter. Tentative Program Committee.
