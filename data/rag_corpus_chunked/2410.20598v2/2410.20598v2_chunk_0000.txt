It has shown great prominence in enhancing the functionality and perfor mance of large language model (LLM)-based applications. However , with the comprehensive application of RAG, more and more problem s and limitations have been identiﬁed, thus urgently requiri ng fur- ther fundamental exploration to improve current RAG frameworks. This workshop aims to explore in depth how to conduct reﬁned and reliable RAG for downstream AI tasks. To this end, we propose to organize the ﬁrst R 3AG workshop at SIGIR-AP 2024 to call for participants to re-examine and formulate the basic principles and practical implementation of reﬁned and re- liable RAG. The workshop serves as a platform for both academ ia and industry researchers to conduct discussions, share ins ights, and foster research to build the next generation of RAG syste ms. Participants will engage in discussions and presentations focusing on fundamental challenges, cutting-edge research, and pot ential pathways to improve RAG. At the end of the workshop, we aim to have a clearer understanding of how to improve the reliability and applicability of RAG with more robust information retrieva l and language generation.
