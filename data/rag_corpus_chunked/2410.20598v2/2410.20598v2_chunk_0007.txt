sponse quality of RAG-based LLMs across multiple dimension s, such as relevance, faithfulness, negative rejection, info rmation in- tegration, creative generation, and error correction. Multimodal R3AG. Most current research focuses on textual RAG, despite the need for multimodality in many applications. Re cent large-scale models like Flamingo [3], and GPT-4 [1] show sig nif- icant multimodal capability when scaled to tens of billions of pa- rameters and trained on extensive multimodal corpora. These large multimodal models require RAG even more than unimodal textu al LLMs for external knowledge support. Therefore, the worksh op encourage discussions regarding R 3AG for large multimodal mod- els. R3AG: First Workshop on Refined and Reliable Retrieval Augmented Generation SIGIR-AP ’24, December 9–12, 2024, Tokyo, Japan 3 PROGRAM SKETCH 3.1 Workshop Format The workshop is planned to be hosted for half a day, including 2 invited talks and 4 oral research talks. There are two encour aging types of invited talks: (i) academic talks on fundamental re search on the adaptability and reliability of RAG techniques; and ( ii) in- dustrial talks on the practice of designing or applying reﬁn ed and reliable RAG techniques for real-world applications, incl uding in- formation retrieval and generative systems. Each talk should be delivered as a slide-based lecture. A Q&A session will follow the conclusion of each talk. 3.2 Tentative Workshop Schedule The workshop schedule is planned with one half-day session: - 9:00 - 9:10 Welcome & opening - 9:10 - 9:50 Academic invited talk - 9:50 - 10:30 Industrial invited talk - 10:30 - 10:50 Coﬀee break - 10:50 - 11:40 Oral paper talks - 11:40 - 12:00 Panel discussion Tentative Speakers. The tentative speakers include academia re- searchers, such as Dr. Xiangyu Zhao from the City University of Hong Kong, and Prof. Hideo Joho from University of
