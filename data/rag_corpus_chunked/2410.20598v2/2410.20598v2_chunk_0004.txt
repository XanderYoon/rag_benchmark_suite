interesting points re- lated to the RAG pipelines, i.e., user intent comprehension , knowl- edge parsing, knowledge retrieval, and response generatio n. The detailed topics are described in section 2. Relevance. On the one hand, generative LLMs are hot research topics in the IR communities. The capability of LLMs enriche s the scope of IR and has changed the process of information seeking to a large extend. On the other hand, RAG is one of the most important applications of IR in LLMs. IR plays a new and essential role i n LLM-based downstream tasks. To this end, this workshop of R3AG is highly relevant to the SIGIR-AP conference. Motivation. Recently, the potential of RAG has been veriﬁed in various AI applications. However, there still exists fundamental re- search challenges to further improve current RAG methods. SIGIR- AP is one of the leading conferences with numerous recognized re- search works focusing on IR-related research and applications. We believe that organizing the R 3AG workshop with SIGIR-AP now can (i) stimulate interesting research to meet complex info rma- tion seeking demands; (ii) encourage the community to condu ct in-depth research and practical applications on reﬁned and reli- able RAG; (iii) expand the impact of SIGIR-AP conferences and the workshop. 2 FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGES AND TOPICS This year we will focus more on fundamental challenges in thi s ﬁeld and expect thorough discussions during the R 3AG workshop. User Intent Comprehension.User intent comprehension directly aﬀects the following retrieval and ﬁnal response generatio n. How- ever, user intent comprehension could be challenging espec ially under long dialogue context. R 3AG is expected to help users clar- ify their information needs during the interaction process. Besides, R3AG should have the capability to split complex queries into s im- ple queries to accomplish user demands. Related
