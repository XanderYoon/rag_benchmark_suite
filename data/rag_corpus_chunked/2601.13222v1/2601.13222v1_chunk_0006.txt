En- Incorporating Q&A Nuggets into Retrieval-Augmented Generation 5 glish. The topics are broad, e.g., “Roundup cases and Bayer”, yet each report must be tailored to the specific problem statement and user background. The collection’s evaluation tool,AutoArgue[26], uses held-out, manually curated gold-nugget banks. Compared systems.UsingLLaMA-3.3-70B-Instructand PlaidX retriever, we compare two variants ofCruciblewith state-of-the-art systems: Crucible-Base(ours),as described in Section 3 without the verification step. Crucible-Verified(ours),full pipeline with check for coverage/support. Ginger[14],a nugget-informed RAG system that generates responses based on clusters built on the extracted nuggets from the retrieved documents. While the released implementation does not produce citations in its response, we assign citations to the document that contains the nuggets closest to the cluster centroid. This is an alternative system that is based on ideas similar to those inCrucible. We report the best variant, where initial set of documents is retrieved by Qwen3-Embedding bi-encoder [30], underlying LLM isGPT-4o. Ginger-Llama:Using the GINGER implementation with the same LLaMA LLM to allow a fair comparison toCrucible. GptResearcher[7, 8]a simple agentic system with subqueries, retrieval, and writing. Uses LLaMA as LLM (despite the name). BulletPoints[29],an extractive pipeline (best in TREC NeuCLIR 2024, sub- mitted ashltcoe-eugene). Uses LLaMA as LLM. Evaluation metrics.We report metrics from theAutoArgueframework [26]. Nugget Recall= covered nuggets gold nuggets measures the recall of gold nuggets. Nugget Density= covered nuggets sentences balance of coverage vs. concise summaries. Sentence Novelty= sentences mention a new nugget all sentences , fraction of sentences that in- troduce new relevant information, according to gold nuggets. Relevant Sentences= sentence with nuggets all sentences measures how many sentences men- tion relevant nuggets. Citation Support= supported citations citations , measures how many citations actually support their summary sentence. 5 Results Table 1 reports results averaged across NeuCLIR topics.Crucibleconsistently outperformsGingerandGinger-LLaMA on all nugget-oriented metrics.
