appear in a system answer, nuggets enable evaluation metrics such as “nugget recall” that directly quantify the amount of useful information given by the information system. We argue that nuggets are valuable not only for evaluation but also for guiding retrieval and generation, especially given that LLMs can produce high-quality nuggets automatically [4, 9]. 6 Appendix athttps://github.com/hltcoe/ecir26-crucible-system-appendix/ arXiv:2601.13222v1 [cs.IR] 19 Jan 2026 2 Dietz et al. Contributions.To support this argument, we presentCrucible, a nugget- centric RAG system that automatically constructs its own nugget bank and uses it as a control signal throughout the pipeline. For example, nuggets form the ba- sis for controlling redundancy without content-based clustering, while naturally preserving citation provenance. On the TREC NeuCLIR 2024 test collection, we provide a direct comparison to a recent nugget-oriented RAG systemGin- ger[14]. We find thatCrucibledecisively outperformsGingeracross several evaluation metrics, from nugget recall to citation support. 2 Related Work Summarize one-document-at-a-time.Early RAG systems either produce a sum- mary per retrieved passage [16] or encode each passage separately [13]. This retains exact citation provenance, but the model must attend to many indepen- dent inputs, which often harms coherence and fluency. Joint representation.Later work uses a single joint representation to represent the retrieved document set.RealM[12] andEMDR2[24] learn a unified en- coding;xRAG[3] pushes this to the extreme by compressing all content into a single token representation. These approaches improve synthesis and fluency, yet the compact latent representation discards explicit links to source documents, making citation grounding difficult and the pipeline opaque to developers. A rec- ommended remedy is to first hallucinates an answer and then retrieve supporting evidence, as inHyDE[11], which raises lingering concerns about trustworthi- ness. Clustering-based RAG.Ginger[14] is a nugget-based RAG system that defines nuggets as verbatim text spans copied directly from retrieved passages. These spans are first clustered into topical facets using
