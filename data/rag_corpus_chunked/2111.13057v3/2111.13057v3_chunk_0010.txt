UQV100 for the same back- story. In total, 365K such pairs exist; Table 2 (4th column) contains a number of {𝑞𝑖, 𝑞𝑗 } examples. We sampled 100 query variation pairs from the 365K available ones for manual annotation. Three authors of this paper (the “annotators”) performed an open card sort [55]. The annotators independently sorted the query variation pairs into different piles and named them, each representing a transformation 𝑇 that can be applied to 𝑞𝑖 and then leads to 𝑞 𝑗 , i.e. 𝑇 (𝑞𝑖 ) = 𝑞 𝑗 . Multiple transformations might be applied to 𝑞𝑖 in order to yield 𝑞 𝑗 , e.g. 𝑇2 (𝑇1 (𝑞𝑖 )) = 𝑞 𝑗 . After the independent sorting step, the different piles were dis- cussed and merged where necessary, which yielded five categories of transformations. Since the UQV100 data used had already been spelling-corrected by its authors, we added the categorymisspellings. The resulting taxonomy can be found in Table 2. It contains a con- crete definition and examples for each of our—in total—six cate- gories: (I) generalization or specialization , (II) aspect change , (III) misspelling, (IV) naturality, (V) word ordering and (VI) paraphrasing. We observed two broad types of transformations: transformations that change the semantics of the query and transformations that do not change the semantics. The gen./specialization and aspect change transformations fall into the former type, whereas all other categories fall into the latter. We highlight here that unlike pre- vious categorizations that describe how users revise queries in e-commerce [3, 26], how to generate better queries to substitute the original query [ 28], how users reformulate queries in a ses- sion [27], we study here how to categorize query variations for the same information need which is a related but different problem.
