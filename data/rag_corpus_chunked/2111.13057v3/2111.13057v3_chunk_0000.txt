IR benchmarks evaluate the effectiveness of (neu- ral) ranking models based on the premise that a single query is used to instantiate the underlying information need. However, previous research has shown that (I) queries generated by users for a fixed in- formation need are extremely variable and, in particular, (II) neural models are brittle and often easily make mistakes when tested with adversarial examples, i.e. examples with minimal modifications that do not change its label. Motivated by those observations we aim to answer the following question with our work: how robust are re- trieval pipelines with respect to different variations in queries that do not change the queries’ semantics? In order to obtain queries that are representative of users’ querying variability, we first created a taxon- omy based on the manual annotation of transformations occurring in a dataset (specifically UQV100) of user created query variations. For example, from the query ‘cures for a bald spot ’ to the variation ‘cures for baldness’ we are applying aparaphrasing transformation that replaces words with synonyms. For each syntax-changing cat- egory of our taxonomy, we employ different automatic methods that when applied to a query generate a query variation. We con- duct experiments on two datasets (TREC-DL-2019 and ANTIQUE) and create a total of 2430 query variations from 243 topics across both datasets. Our experimental results for two different IR tasks reveal that retrieval pipelines are not robust to query variations that maintain the content
