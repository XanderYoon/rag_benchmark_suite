preference for natural language queries as op- posed to keyword queries, which is a finding aligned with previous work [17]. Another interesting finding is that the word order does not have a great effect on TNN models (decreases smaller than 0.01). This is in line with recent research that indicates that the word order might not be as important as initially thought for transformer models [45, 51]. 5.2 Fusing Query Variations Although on average query variations make models less effective, there are cases when there are effectiveness gains (as shown with TREC−DL−2019 ANTIQUE 0 3 6 9 0 10 20 30 T5 BERT EPIC CKNRM KNRM RM3 BM25 Number queries with higher nDCG@10 than original query category misspelling naturality ordering paraphrase Figure 4: Distribution of query variations that are better than the original query by model and category of query vari- ation. the positive nDCG@10 Δ in Figure 2). This motivates the combina- tion of different query variations to obtain better ranking effective- ness. In order to understand whether we can improve effectiveness of models by combining different query variations, we compare different methods for combining queries, as displayed in Table 7. 𝑅𝑅𝐹 𝐶 indicates that we fuse the results obtained from the query variations obtained after applying 𝑀𝐶 methods using the Recipro- cal Rank Fusion (RRF) method [15], and 𝑅𝑅𝐹 𝐴𝑙𝑙 fuses the results obtained by all query variation methods12. First we see that there is potential to have significant effective- ness gains, as shown by the last line (best query) where we always use the query with the highest retrieval effectiveness amongst query variations and the original query. The results show that combining query variations with RRF is better than using query variations individually (Table 5), and sometimes it is even the same as using the original query
