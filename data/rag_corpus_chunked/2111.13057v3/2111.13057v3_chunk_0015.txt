with a randomly chosen new ASCII character. 3We use the NLTK english stopwords list for all the methods; it is available at https: //www.nltk.org/. Evaluating the Robustness of Retrieval Pipelines with Query Variation Generators Woodstock ’18, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY QWERTYCharSub Replaces a random character of a random query term (excluding stopwords) with another character from the QW- ERTY keyboard such that only characters in close proximity are chosen, replicating errors that come from typing too quickly. 3.2.2 Naturality. The two methods in this category transform natural language queries into keyword queries. RemoveStopWords Removes all stopwords from the query. T5DescToTitle Applies an encoder-decoder transformer model (here we employ T5 [47]) that we fine-tuned on the task of gen- erating the title of a TREC topic title based on the TREC topic description. For example, a title and description tuple from ‘trec- robust04’: ‘Evidence that rap music has a negative effect on young people.’→ ‘Rap and Crime’. We collect pairs of title and description from eleven datasets available through the IR datasets library [34]: trec-robust04, trec-tb-2004, aquaint/trec-robust-2005, gov/trec- web-2002, ntcir-www-2, ntcir-www-3, trec-misinfo-2019, cord19/trec- covid, dd-trec-2015, dd-trec-2016 and dd-trec-2017. Over- all, we fine-tuned our model on 1322 description/title tuples. 3.2.3 Ordering. In this category, we employ only one basic method to shuffle words as done by previous research on the order of words [32, 45]. RandomOrderSwap Randomly swap two words of the query. 3.2.4 Paraphrasing. The four methods in this category change one or more query terms in the process of paraphrasing. BackTranslation Applies a translation method to the query to a pivot language, i.e. an auxiliary language, and from the pivot language back to the original language of the query, i.e. English. In our experiments we employ the M2M100 [20] model, a multilin- gual model that can translate between any
