These methods are listed in Table 3, each with an example transformation. We explain each one in more detail in this section. A method 𝑀𝐶 receives as input a query 𝑞 and outputs a query variation ˆ𝑞: 𝑀𝐶 (𝑞) = ˆ𝑞. While most of the methods can generate multiple variations for a single input query (for example by replacing different words of the same query by synonyms or by including several spelling mistakes), for the experiments in the paper we resort to using a single query variation per method which already yields enough data for analysis (see § 4.1). Inspired by adversarial examples, we aim to make minimal perturbations to the input text when possible, e.g. replace only one word by a synonym, increasing the chances of obtaining valid variations. 3.2.1 Misspelling. The three methods in this category add one spelling error to the query; the query term an error is introduced in is chosen uniformly at random. NeighbCharSwap Swaps two neighbouring characters from a ran- dom query term (excluding stopwords3). RandomCharSub Replaces a random character from a random query term (excluding stopwords) with a randomly chosen new ASCII character. 3We use the NLTK english stopwords list for all the methods; it is available at https: //www.nltk.org/.
