we introduced, we need to evaluate their quality: how good are these methods at generating query variations that a user would also generate? To this end, we consider two properties of the generated queries: (I) ˆ𝑞 maintains the same semantics as𝑞, and (II) the syntax difference between 𝑞 and ˆ𝑞 can be attributed to the category 𝐶. All pairs of 𝑞 and ˆ𝑞 = 𝑀 (𝑞) from the test sets of TREC-DL-2019 (43 queries) and ANTIQUE (200 queries) for each of the 10 automatic variation methods went to the following process. First, we automatically set the variations frommisspelling9 and ordering as valid, since they are rule based transformations to the input. Then all transformations that generate a variation that is identical to the input query ( ˆ𝑞 = 𝑀 (𝑞) = 𝑞) was automatically set to invalid. The annotators (the authors) then annotated independently the remaining 1371 pairs of {𝑞, ˆ𝑞} for the two mentioned properties (binary labels). The percentage of queries that are valid (both desired properties) are displayed at the right-most columns of Table 3 for the 10 automatic variation methods used in the paper and all combinations of {𝑞, ˆ𝑞} (2430). We find the methods in the paraphrasing category to yield the largest percentage of invalid query variations: fewer than 38% of query variations generated via WordNetSynSwap are valid. A man- ual inspection of the invalid queries reveal the following insights: (I) T5DescToTitle at times removes query terms that are impor- tant for the query and thus change its semantics (e.g. ‘ if i had a bad breath what should i do ’→ ‘if i had a ’ ), (II) BackTranslation and T5QQP methods can generate an identical copy of the input query which was automatically labelled as invalid (e.g. ‘ what is dark energy’→ ‘what is
