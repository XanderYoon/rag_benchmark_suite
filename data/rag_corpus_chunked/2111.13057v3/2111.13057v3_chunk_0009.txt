Our work differs from the adversarial line of research by evaluating the robustness of models to query modifica- tions that could be generated by humans, i.e. transformations that naturally occur, and not modifications optimized to trick neural models. 3 AUTOMATIC QUERY V ARIATIONS We now first describe in Section 3.1 how we arrived at our query variation categories in a data-driven manner by annotating a large set of user-created query variations from UQV100. We end up with six categories: four that change the syntax (but not the semantics) and two that change the semantics. In our work, we focus on the four syntax-changing categories. In Section 3.2 we subsequently describe our methods to automatically generate query variations for each category of the taxonomy that does not change the query semantics. 3.1 UQV Taxonomy In order to better understand how queries differ when we compare different query variations for the same information need, we resort to analyzing variations from the UQV100 dataset. UQV100 contains query variations for 100 (sub)-topics from the TREC 2013 and 2014 web tracks, written by crowd workers who received a “backstory” for each topic as a starting point. On average, UQV100 contains 57.7 spelling corrected (corrected by the UQV100 authors using the spelling service of the Bing search engine) query variations per topic. We consider a query variation pair {𝑞𝑖, 𝑞𝑗 } to be a set of two queries 𝑞𝑖 and 𝑞 𝑗 that were provided in UQV100 for the same back- story. In total, 365K such pairs exist; Table 2 (4th column) contains a number of {𝑞𝑖, 𝑞𝑗 } examples. We sampled 100 query variation pairs from the 365K available ones for manual annotation. Three authors of this paper (the “annotators”) performed an open card sort [55]. The annotators independently sorted the query variation pairs into
