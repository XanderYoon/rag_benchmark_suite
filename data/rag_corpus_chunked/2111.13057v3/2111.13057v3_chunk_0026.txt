In order to study the effect of each query variation category, Figure 2 displays the nDCG@10 Δ (difference in effectiveness when replacing the orig- inal query by its variation) distribution per category and model. Although some queries variations have a positive effect (points with positive Δ), the distributions are mostly skewed towards effec- tiveness decreases (negative Δ). First we see that the on average the decreases are higher for the misspelling category: -0.25 and -0.08 of nDCG@10 Δ for TREC-DL- 2019 and ANTIQUE respectively. We hypothesize that the effect is higher on TREC-DL-2019 due to it having smaller queries than TREC-DL-2019 (see average number of terms per query on Table 4). The second highest effect on both datasets are the query varia- tions from the paraphrasing category (-0.08 and -0.03 of nDCG@10 Δ) followed by naturality (-0.05 and -0.03). Compared to the mis- spelling variations which in most cases degrade the effectiveness of our models, paraphrasing and naturality have more queries for which the effect is positive, rendering the overall nDCG@10
