embedding which yields better synonyms than standard Glove embeddings [39]. WordNetSynSwap Replaces a non-stop word by a the first synonym found on WordNet 6. If there are no words with valid synonyms it will not output a valid variation. 4As available here https://huggingface.co/ramsrigouthamg/t5_paraphraser 5https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-question-pairs 6https://wordnet.princeton.edu/ Table 4: Statistics of the datasets.

For each of the test set queries, we generate one query variation for each of the proposed methods, and we use the manual annotation described in this section ( §4.4) to take into account only the valid generated query variations in our experiments. The statistics of the datasets can be found in Table 4. 4.2 Ranking Models We use different ranking models that cover from lexical traditional models (Trad) such as BM25, to neural ranking models (NN) such as KNRM and neural ranking models that employ transformer-based language models (TNN) such as BERT. For all of our experiments, we apply BM25 as a first stage retriever and re-rank the top 100 results with the neural ranking models, which is an established and efficient approach [29]. For BM25 [50] and RM3 [1] we resort to the default hyperpa- rameters and implementation provided by the PyTerrier toolkit [35]. We trained the kernel-based ranking models KNRM
