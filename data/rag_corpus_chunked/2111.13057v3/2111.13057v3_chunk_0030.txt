significant effective- ness gains, as shown by the last line (best query) where we always use the query with the highest retrieval effectiveness amongst query variations and the original query. The results show that combining query variations with RRF is better than using query variations individually (Table 5), and sometimes it is even the same as using the original query (no statistical difference). Our results indicate that while rank fusion mitigates the decreases in effective- ness of different query variations ( 𝑅𝑅𝐹 𝐴𝑙𝑙 decreases are of 3% and 10% nDCG@10 for TREC-DL-2019 and ANTIQUE re- spectively when compared to the original query), it does not improve the effectiveness over using the original query . 5.2.1 When are query variations better? To better understand when models benefit from different query variations, we plot the distri- bution of query variations that improve over the original query by ranking model and query variation category in Figure 4. We see that overall the queries obtained through the naturality and paraphrasing methods are the ones that improve over the original queries the most. Intuitively, paraphrasing query variations can potentially rewrite the query with better terms (e.g. ‘why do crim- inals practice crime ’→ ‘why do criminals practice misdemeanour ’ +0.13 nDCG@10 for BERT usingWordEmbedSynSwap), make queries grammatically correct (e.g. ‘how sun rises ’→ ‘how does the sun rise’ +0.03 nDCG@10 for BERT using T5QQP) and also corrects spelling mistakes (e.g. ‘what is sosiology’→ ‘what is sociology’ +0.47 nDCG@10 for BERT using BackTranslation). naturality methods make the queries shorter (e.g. ‘who is robert gray ’→ ‘robert gray’ 12ordering was not included in the experiments as a separated row since it only has one method, but it is included in the 𝑅𝑅𝐹 𝐴𝑙𝑙 method.
