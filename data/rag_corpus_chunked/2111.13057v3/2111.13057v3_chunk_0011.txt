unlike pre- vious categorizations that describe how users revise queries in e-commerce [3, 26], how to generate better queries to substitute the original query [ 28], how users reformulate queries in a ses- sion [27], we study here how to categorize query variations for the same information need which is a related but different problem. Having arrived at our six categories, our annotators then la- beled an additional set of 550 {𝑞𝑖, 𝑞𝑗 } randomly sampled pairs from UQV100 in order to determine the distribution of these categories in UQV100. Each {𝑞𝑖, 𝑞𝑗 } was labelled as belonging to one (or more) of the five categories (with the exception of misspelling which, as already stated, had already been corrected by the UQV100 authors). In order to determine the inter-annotator agreement, 25 {𝑞𝑖, 𝑞𝑗 } pairs were labelled by all three annotators, and 175 pairs were each labelled by a single annotator. The inter-annotator agreement [14] was moderate (Cohen’s𝜅 = 0.42); the disagreements were high- est for the naturality and paraphrasing categories. We found that a total of 56 {𝑞𝑖, 𝑞𝑗 } pairs had more than one category assigned to it2. The resulting distribution is shown in Table 2 (right-most column); the categories of query variations that change the query without changing its semantics account for 57% of all the transfor- mations. In contrast, 43% of query variations are semantic changes. Among the syntax-changing categories, we found naturality to be the most common with 33% of all transformations falling into this category. Having observed that query variations change the syntax, but not the semantics for the majority of cases,we focus in the remainder of our work on syntax-changing query varia- tions. We leave the exploration of query variation generators for gen./specialization and aspect change as future work. 3.2 Query Generators For
