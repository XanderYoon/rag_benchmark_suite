most common with 33% of all transformations falling into this category. Having observed that query variations change the syntax, but not the semantics for the majority of cases,we focus in the remainder of our work on syntax-changing query varia- tions. We leave the exploration of query variation generators for gen./specialization and aspect change as future work. 3.2 Query Generators For each of the four syntax-changing categories, we explored differ- ent methods that generate query variations of the specified category. 2For example, the pair {“what is doctor zhivago all about”, “dr zhivago synopsis”} had both paraphrasing and naturality labels, as it goes from a natural language question to a keyword-base question and also paraphrases “doctor [...] all about” to “dr [...] synopsis” Woodstock ’18, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY Gustavo Penha, Arthur Câmara, and Claudia Hauff Table 2: Taxonomy of query variations derived from a sample of the UQV100 dataset. Last column is the count of each query variation found on UQV100 based on manual annotation of tuples of queries for the same information need. * spelling errors were already fixed for the UQV100 pairs. Category Definition Changes Se- mantics {𝑞𝑖, 𝑞𝑗 } Examples from UQV100 Count (%) Gen./specialization Generalizes or specializes within the same information need. ✓ american civil war ↔ number of battles in south carolina during civil war 172 (26.34%) Aspect change Moves between related but different as- pects within the same information need. ✓ what types of spiders can bite you while gar- dening ↔ signs of spider bite 111 (17.00%) Misspelling Adds or removes spelling errors. raspberry pi ↔ raspeberry pi * Naturality Moves between keyword queries and natural language queries. how does zinc relate to wilson’s disease ↔ zinc wilson’s disease 118 (18.07%) Ordering Changes the order of words carotid cavernous fis- tula treatment. ↔
