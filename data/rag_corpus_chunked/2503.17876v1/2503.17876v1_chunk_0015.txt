The first column lists the names of the models evaluated, including DoctorGLM, ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGLM-6B, Ziya-LLaMA-13B, HuatuoGPT, and variations of Ours. Each model represents a different approach or version in the medical consultation simulation or relevant language model application fields. The second column, labeled ”Patient satisfaction,” displays the percentage of patient satisfaction along with the raw number of satisfied instances out of 600. The satisfaction rates are expressed as percentages and are derived from a pos- sibly larger-scale study involving 600 individual assessments or interactions for each model. To ensure the integrity of the Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) study assess- ing patient satisfaction with medical consultation responses, participants were provided with unequivocal instructions. Satisfaction was gauged using a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 ( not satisfied ) to 5 ( extremely satisfied ). Quality control was maintained through embedded attention checks to validate partici- pant engagement. Consistency in responses was assured by interspersing identi- cal questions in varying forms throughout the survey, enabling cross-verification of data reliability. These methodologies combined to form a robust framework, optimizing the authenticity of the satisfaction metrics obtained. Notably, the patient satisfaction percentages progressively increase for the variants of Ours - Ours (w/o TEIR) , Ours (w/o EICL) , and Ours, with Ours achieving the highest satisfaction rate at 36.83% (221 out of 600).
