to ensure the removal of any personal identifiers, uphold- ing patient confidentiality and adhering to strict privacy standards. These data are beneficial for training the model. Utilizing 30% of the dataset for testing purposes and allocating the remaining 70% for training the model significantly enhances the model’s reliability. This distribution of data ensures a comprehen- sive learning process while maintaining a robust framework for validation and assessment of the model’s performance. Title Suppressed Due to Excessive Length 9 Evaluation Metrics. Our results are presented using a range of sophisticated evaluation metrics to ensure a comprehensive analysis of the model’s perfor- mance in various aspects of language understanding and generation. – BLEU-5 (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy): This metric is an ex- tension of the standard BLEU score, which is widely used to evaluate the quality of text that has been machine-translated from one language to an- other. BLEU-5 specifically refers to using the average precision of up to 5 grams (sequences of five consecutive words) to assess translation quality, providing a more nuanced understanding of the model’s linguistic accuracy and fluency. – ROUGE-2/L (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation): ROUGE is primarily used to evaluate automatic summarization and machine translation. ROUGE-2 refers to the overlap of bigrams between the gener- ated text and a set of reference texts, effectively measuring the quality of content reproduction. ROUGE-L, on the other hand, focuses on the longest common subsequence and is particularly adept at assessing the sentence-level structure similarity between the generated text and reference texts. In employing these advanced metrics, we aim to thoroughly assess the model’s ability to generate coherent, contextually relevant, and linguistically accurate content. By focusing on both the micro-structure of language (as captured by BLEU-5) and the effective conveyance of meaning and structure (as captured by ROUGE-2/L), we provide a holistic
