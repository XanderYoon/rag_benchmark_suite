professional doctor, it has a very good performance, probably because the content it generates is more in line with the human mind. Overall, our model won almost all 1v1 battles. 12 J. Tang et al.

By analyzing the performance impact of each component’s removal, we gain insights into their contributions. Ablation of TEIR Without TEIR, Ours (w/o TEIR) exhibits a decrease in BLEU-1 and BLEU-4 scores, indicating the importance of TEIR in captur- ing accurate unigrams and coherent longer n-gram sequences. The reduction in the GLEU score suggests that TEIR enhances sentence-level alignment with ref- erence translations. Lower ROUGE scores point to TEIR’s role in replicating essential content and maintaining structural integrity. Ablation of EICL The absence of EICL inOurs (w/o EICL)leads to lowered performance across ROUGE and Distinct metrics. This suggests that EICL may be instrumental in capturing critical details and enhancing the diversity and uniqueness
