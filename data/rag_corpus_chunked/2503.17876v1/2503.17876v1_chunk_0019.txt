suggests that TEIR enhances sentence-level alignment with ref- erence translations. Lower ROUGE scores point to TEIR’s role in replicating essential content and maintaining structural integrity. Ablation of EICL The absence of EICL inOurs (w/o EICL)leads to lowered performance across ROUGE and Distinct metrics. This suggests that EICL may be instrumental in capturing critical details and enhancing the diversity and uniqueness of the generated text. Combined Impact The results of the ablation study indicate that both TEIR and EICL significantly contribute to theOurs model’s ability to handle complex tasks in the Chinese medical QA dataset. Their combined contributions are pivotal in enhancing the model’s precision and capacity to generate contextually rich and diverse language. Title Suppressed Due to Excessive Length 13 5 Conclusion In conclusion, our method is a retrieval-augmented generation framework. It innovatively integrates Terminology-Enhanced Information Retrieval and Emo- tional In-Context Learning, significantly enhancing its ability to understand complex medical dialogues and emotional contexts. Following rigorous evalua- tion with 803,564 medical consultations, our method has demonstrated superior performance compared to existing models. This advancement represents a sub- stantial contribution to the field of artificial intelligence, particularly in retrieval- augmented methodologies. It holds immense potential to revolutionize medical information retrieval and generation, setting a new trajectory for the application of artificial intelligence in healthcare. This research highlights the transforma- tive implications of our method, not just as a technological innovation but as a pivotal step towards more sophisticated, responsive, and empathetic healthcare solutions. Given the limited time doctors spend with each patient and ongoing patient complaints, satisfaction with medical consultations is not consistently achieved. Our new framework has the potential to create a more satisfying med- ical consultation environment for patients by addressing their emotions. Ad- ditionally, our framework promises to contribute to future medical education, offering insights on establishing effective
