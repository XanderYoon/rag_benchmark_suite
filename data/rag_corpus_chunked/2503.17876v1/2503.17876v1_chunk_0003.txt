further complicating the effectiveness of digital medical advisories. Another pertinent issue is the efficiency of information retrieval during con- sultations. Patients seeking medical advice are often met with overwhelming amounts of information [9], much of which may be irrelevant or too complex to understand. This not only prolongs the consultation process but also adds to the cognitive load of the patients, potentially exacerbating their stress and anxiety [10]. The existing systems need to be more adept at quickly providing precise, understandable [11], and relevant information tailored to the individual needs of each patient. In light of these challenges, this article introduces a novel framework aimed at significantly enhancing the quality and effectiveness of online medical consul- Title Suppressed Due to Excessive Length 3 tations. The proposed framework is the culmination of extensive research and development, leveraging the latest advancements in information technology, data analytics, and LLMs. The contributions of this study are manifold, addressing the core issues identified in the current systems and setting new benchmarks for what digital medical consultations can achieve. The enhancements are specifi- cally designed to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and user satisfaction of online medical consultations, making healthcare advice more accessible and reliable for everyone. Our contributions are detailed as follows: 1. Generating Enhancement Based on Terminology-Enhanced Infor- mation Retrieval (TEIR) : Traditional terminology match methods are often limited by their literal approach to query understanding, frequently overlooking the contextual nuances and user intent. Our approach revolu- tionizes this mechanism by incorporating advanced linguistic models and terminology-aware algorithms. These enhancements enable the system to obtain the underlying intent and specifics of user queries, leading to a more nuanced and accurate retrieval of information. This not only improves the relevance of the consultation content but also reduces the time users spend sifting through unnecessary information. 2.
