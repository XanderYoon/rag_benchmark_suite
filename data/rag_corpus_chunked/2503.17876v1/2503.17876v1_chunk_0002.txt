A significant proportion of medical consultations transpire online [3–5], offering unprecedented accessibility and convenience to patients. This digital transformation has not only redefined the interaction be- tween healthcare providers and patients but has also generated a massive influx of data [6]. This article delves into the realm of medical consultation in China by meticulously analyzing 803,564 instances of such data, collected through ad- vanced web crawlers designed to navigate and retrieve information from a myriad of online consultation platforms. An example of medical dialogue, as illustrated in Figure 1, emphasizes that by engaging in proactive keywords and emotional inquiries, a more nuanced understanding of the patient’s experience and poten- tial concerns can be obtained, thereby contributing to a more comprehensive medical diagnosis. The motivation for embarking on this research journey is rooted in the need to enhance the existing knowledge-enhanced information retrieval models preva- lent in the field. While these models have significantly contributed to the ad- vancement of medical consultations, they are not devoid of limitations. One of the primary concerns is the accuracy and relevance of the information provided during the consultations [7]. Misinformation or irrelevant advice can lead to pa- tient dissatisfaction, mistrust, and in severe cases, adverse health outcomes [8]. Additionally, the impersonal nature of online consultations often overlooks the emotional and psychological nuances of patient-provider interactions, further complicating the effectiveness of digital medical advisories. Another pertinent issue is the efficiency of information retrieval during con- sultations. Patients seeking medical advice are often met with overwhelming amounts of information [9], much of which may be irrelevant or too complex to understand. This not only prolongs the consultation process but also adds to the cognitive load of the
