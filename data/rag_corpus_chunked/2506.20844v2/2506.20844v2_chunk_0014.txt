and learned approaches, using either relevance labels or features derived from score distributions to determine the cut-off point [10, 52, 59, 61, 103, 109]. A related line of work is stopping methods in technology-assisted review (TAR) [14, 15, 85], which aim to retrieve as much relevant information as possible while min- imising the effort spent on examining irrelevant documents. Both approaches aim to optimise an expected metric over candidate cut positions, typically using metrics such as 𝐹 1@𝑘 or 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 @𝑘. The datasets used in these prior studies on RLT and stopping methods, such as CLEF and TREC [25–27, 33, 43–45], exhibit imbalance but The Next Phase of Scientific Fact-Checking: Advanced Evidence Retrieval from Complex Structured Academic Papers ICTIR ’25, July 18, 2025, Padua, Italy typically contain enough relevant items per query to support recall- based supervision and evaluation. This dependence on sufficient relevance labels becomes problematic in fact-checking scenarios, where gold evidence documents are typically rare, making both recall-based stopping and supervised RLT approaches unsuited to this problem. To explore whether relevance score distributions indicate evi- dence sufficiency, we compare well-studied and less-studied claims from SciFact-Open. Following Wadden et. al. [ 101], claims with four or more gold evidence documents are considered to be well- studied and those with none to be less-studied. Using monoT5-3B, we compute several statistics over the ranked document scores, including first-document relevance, average and total scores, score decay, and the initial-to-final score ratio. Table 4 shows that well- studied claims tend to have higher top-ranked scores and sharper decay patterns, suggesting that relevance distributions may serve as indicators of evidence sufficiency.
