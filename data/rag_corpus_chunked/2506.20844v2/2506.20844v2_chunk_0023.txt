citation conventions, preventing infinite citation loops in verification. In summary, to explore time-aware fact-checking for scientific literature, we propose two potential research directions: (1) Integrat- ing temporal information into retrieval and verification to handle outdated evidence and (2) Developing citation-based tracking meth- ods to identify the original source and timestamp of evidence. These directions provide a basis for studying the impact of time-aware mechanisms in scientific fact-checking systems. 5 Structured Long-Context Evidence Retrieval Existing scientific fact-checking datasets construct evidence cor- pora using fragmented sentences, paragraphs, or abstracts [16, 49, 62, 72, 75, 100, 104]. However, scientific literature is typically pre- sented in structured, visually rich formats, often as PDF documents, where different sections serve distinct functions: abstracts, results, and conclusions summarise key findings, while background and in- troduction sections provide prior research context. With the diverse and unique functionalities of scientific literature components, this section explores challenges and potential research directions for advancing scientific fact-checking at the full-paper level. Existing fact-checking pipelines typically follow a document retrieval and then sentence selection paradigm [ 37, 97, 116]. For general fact- checking, evidence retrieval often uses top-ranked sentences from top-ranked documents, treating them as self-contained evidence Title Authors Publish Venue Publish Time Citations: [ 25, 44 , 60 , 67, 78 , 82 , 92 Figure 3: An example for parsing the scientific literature units. However, this approach neglects long-range context, as using the extracted sentences ignores surrounding information to sup- port verification. In contrast, scientific documents exhibit higher document-level consistency of verdict, commonly one paper hav- ing a sole standpoint to a given question, making document-level processing necessary for scientific fact-checking [50, 102, 119]. LLMs have recently demonstrated growing capability to process long contexts. However, it remains challenging to fact-check an entire full-text document in a single pass [105]. LLMs are
