often misinterpret evi- dence relevance, increasing the likelihood of incorrect verification outcomes. This issue arises when a claim uses a broad term, while the sup- porting evidence provides a more specific instance, or vice versa. As in the following example, such mismatches can lead to incor- rect veracity assignments, as existing models struggle to recognise hierarchical relationships between concepts. Claim: Cancer risk is lower in individuals with a history of alcohol consumption. Supports: Alcohol consumption was associated with a decreased risk of thyroid cancer. This issue is common within scientific fact checking and has been reported to occur within 44% of annotated examples in SciFact-Open [101]. Hence, we argue that capturing the hierarchical relationship could be a research direction to improve verification performance in the scientific domain, by solving the mismatch problem. RD.8. Hierarchical Concept Modelling To address this issue, ontology-based reasoning can be integrated into fact-checking pipelines. Structured ontologies such as MeSH [54] and UMLS [53] define hierarchical relationships that help sys- tems infer term specificity. Recognising that ‘lung cancer’ is a sub- type of ‘cancer’ enables better claim-evidence alignment, mitigat- ing errors caused by lexical similarity. Beyond that, the knowledge graph can enrich ontological reasoning by encoding both hier- archical and associative relationships among scientific concepts [39, 48]. However, its potential for resolving terminology granular- ity mismatches in scientific fact-checking remains unexplored. Ad- ditionally, representation learning techniques such as contrastive learning can embed these hierarchical relationships into vector space representations, reducing reliance on token-level similarity. Domain-specific models like SciBERT [11] and PubMedBERT [35] can further enhance contextual understanding by incorporating structured knowledge into retrieval and verification processes. By leveraging ontological reasoning, knowledge graphs, and struc- tured embeddings, scientific fact-checking systems can better align claims with relevant evidence, reducing verification errors caused by terminology granularity mismatches.
