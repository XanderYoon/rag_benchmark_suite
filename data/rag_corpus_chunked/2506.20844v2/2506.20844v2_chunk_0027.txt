document structures, prioritising relevant sections based on claim types, and efficiently handling conflicting evidence. By integrating structured document parsing, hierarchical retrieval strategies, and context- aware reasoning, future systems can leverage richer evidence from full-paper scientific literature while reducing LLM hallucinations. Advancing these techniques will enhance the reliability and inter- pretability of scientific fact-checking systems. 6 Multimodal content in Science Scientific literature often conveys key evidence using non-textual elements such as tables, charts, and figures, which are commonly used to present experimental results, statistical analyses, and the- oretical models, as shown in Figure 3. For full-text scientific fact- checking, especially across various fields of science and technol- ogy, it is crucial to move beyond text and accurately interpret these structured elements to ensure comprehensive verification. Fact-checking and misinformation detection on individual modal- ities – such as figures [ 1, 65, 66, 69, 93, 112], charts [ 4, 7], and tables [3, 13, 22, 29, 36, 57, 79, 83, 113] – has been studied inde- pendently [5]. To improve tabular reasoning, transformer-based approaches such as TAPAS [38] and Table-BERT [114] have been de- veloped. However, these techniques perform poorly in SCITAB [57], a dataset for scientific fact-checking on tables, with results barely above random. One possible cause is the lack of contextual ground- ing for tables, which are rarely self-contained. Similarly, figures and charts in scientific papers often require surrounding textual expla- nations for correct interpretation. Recent datasets like AVerImaTeC [18] address image-text verification using web-sourced data, but sci- entific domains present greater challenges: figures are densely struc- tured, often span multiple sections, and require domain-specific understanding capability. We argue that scientific fact-checking should shift toward full- paper analysis, where structured elements are interpreted along- side their textual context. Unlike standalone multimodal models, document-level processing enables cross-referencing between fig- ures/tables/charts and their
