formation 𝑝𝑛 𝑐,𝑑, relative to a claim 𝑐, as follows: 𝑉 (𝑐, 𝑑) = 𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑎𝑥 (𝑝𝑟 𝑐,𝑑, 𝑝𝑛 𝑐,𝑑, 𝑝𝑠 𝑐,𝑑 ) (2) +Verification (Ideal Reranker Model) combines semantic relevance and verification feedback to refine evidential retrieval. The final retrieval score is calculated by summing the semantic score (𝑠𝑟 𝑐,𝑑) and the verification probabilities (𝑝𝑟 𝑐,𝑑 and 𝑝𝑛 𝑐,𝑑), followed by a nor- malisation step to ensure the score remains within (0,1), formulated as: 𝑠𝑟 +𝑣 𝑐,𝑑 = 1/2 ∗ (𝑠𝑟 𝑐,𝑑 + 𝑝𝑟 𝑐,𝑑 + 𝑝𝑠 𝑐,𝑑 ) ∈ ( 0, 1) (3) This formulation ensures that documents contributing to support or refute labels receive higher retrieval scores, enhancing the evi- dential quality of retrieved documents. To evaluate retrieval effectiveness, we use Recall@k (R@k), a common evaluation approach that measures the proportion of rele- vant evidence successfully retrieved within the top 𝑘 results. 1https://github.com/dwadden/multivers Table 1: Retrieval result on SciFact-Open and Check-COVID SciFact-Open R@50 R@20 R@10 R@5 R@3 R@1 BM25 66.09 54.78 45.22 38.04 30.87 20.22 monoT5-3B 88.91 79.13 71.09 57.17 48.26 31.09 +Verification 91.96 81.95 71.30 62.61 52.83 32.17 Check-COVID R@50 R@20 R@10 R@5 R@3 R@1 BM25 87.91 81.96 75.02 67.59 61.35 46.18 monoT5-3B 95.84 93.16 89.49 82.06 74.93 58.28 +Verification 96.13 94.55 91.48 84.04 77.80 61.84 Table 2: Evidence positions in the retrieved list.
