space representations, reducing reliance on token-level similarity. Domain-specific models like SciBERT [11] and PubMedBERT [35] can further enhance contextual understanding by incorporating structured knowledge into retrieval and verification processes. By leveraging ontological reasoning, knowledge graphs, and struc- tured embeddings, scientific fact-checking systems can better align claims with relevant evidence, reducing verification errors caused by terminology granularity mismatches. In addition to enhancing precision, this also has potential to improve interpretability by making model decisions more transparent. 9 Conclusion This paper explores the evolution of scientific fact-checking method- ologies from abstract-level approaches to full-paper frameworks on large-scale corpora. As the volume and diversity of scientific knowledge continue to grow, the challenges of verifying claims across heterogeneous sources become increasingly complex. By addressing the complexities inherent in scientific literature, includ- ing its evolving nature, structured format, and the necessity for precise evidence retrieval, we underscore the importance of de- veloping specialised retrieval systems capable of managing large, multimodal, and time-sensitive evidence retrieval. Furthermore, this work proposes several research directions aimed at improving scientific fact-checking efficiency and reliability. They include the integration of time-aware evidence retrieval to ensure the use of the most relevant and up-to-date findings, adaptive document process- ing to enable context-sensitive retrieval strategies, and multi-modal evidence alignment to integrate text, tables and figures to enhance verification accuracy. Overcoming these challenges has potential to improve the accuracy of fact-checking processes and also facilitate the scalability and applicability of these systems in diverse scientific fact-checking scenarios. By bridging the gap between scientific fact- checking and effective evidence retrieval, these advancements will contribute to more robust, interpretable, and trustworthy scientific fact-checking methodologies for real-world applications.
