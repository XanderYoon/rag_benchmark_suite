Scientific fact-checking is a spe- cialised variant of this task, grounded in scientific knowledge, with the objective of combating misinformation that affects the pub- lic, helping researchers in knowledge discovery and assisting in- dividuals in understanding scientific advancements [ 97]. This is particularly important given the rapid emergence of new scien- tific findings, where both professionals and the public must assess the credibility of information. A prominent case occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, in which politically motivated misinfor- mation—ranging from inflated infection statistics to unsupported treatments—circulated extensively, eroding public trust and endan- gering health communication [58]. However, existing approaches to scientific fact-checking remain limited, primarily relying on the retrieval of evidence from relatively simple and small-scale sources [16, 49, 62, 72, 75, 100, 101, 104]. For example, SciFact-Open [101], the largest available dataset for scientific fact-checking, contains 500,000 documents – substantially smaller than PubMed, which con- tains over 37 million biomedical publications. In addition, SciFact- Open consists only of abstracts, rather than full-text papers, thereby excluding critical structural and citation information, ignoring long-
