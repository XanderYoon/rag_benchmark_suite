Alzheimer’s disease. Gold Evidence: [E1,E2,E3,E4,E5] reranker model E1 E2 E3 E4 E5 BM25 838th 141th 7th 163th 67th monot5-3B 1st 8th 16th 2nd 302nd +Verification 1st 3rd 5th 2nd 27th Datasets. We conduct our evaluation using datasets including: (1) SciFact [100]: A corpus of 5,183 abstracts from scientific arti- cles, with 809/300/300 samples for train, validation and test sets. The test set is not publicly accessible. (2) SciFact-Open [101]: An extended version of SciFact with 500K abstracts, re-annotating evi- dence documents for 279 claims from the original SciFact test set.(3) Check-COVID [104]: A COVID-19-specific fact-checking dataset, containing 347 abstracts from CORD-19 journal articles and 1,504 expert annotated news-related claims. MultiVerS is trained on the SciFact train set to create a verifier model that provides verification feedback. Since the SciFact test set is inaccessible, we evaluate document evidence retrieval on SciFact-Open and full Check-COVID. Results. The integration of verification feedback consistently en- hanced document evidence retrieval, as +Verification outperformed monoT5-3B across nearly all cut-off thresholds in both SciFact-Open and Check-COVID (Table 1). The improvements are particularly ev- ident at lower cut-offs, where retrieving the most relevant evidence is crucial. In SciFact-Open, Recall@5 and Recall@3 increased from 57.17% to 62.61% and from 48.26% to 52.83%, respectively. Similarly, in Check-COVID, these metrics improved from 82.06% to 84.04% and from 74.93% to 77.80%. These improvements are particularly meaningful given that the average number of gold evidence doc- uments per claim is 1 in Check-COVID and approximately 2 in SciFact-Open. To illustrate this improvement, we conducted a case study examining how different retrieval methods ranked specific evidence documents (Table 2). Compared to monoT5-3B, +Verifi- cation successfully elevated the ranks of E2, E3 and E5, retrieving three additional pieces of evidence within the top 5 results. Notably, E5, ranked 302nd by monoT5-3B, was effectively rescued by
