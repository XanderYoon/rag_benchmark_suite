two components: 1) the semantic relevance score, computed using an off-the-shelf reranker model, and (2) the verification success feedback score, derived from a fine-tuned verifier model, indicating the degree to which a docu- ment is evidential for a given claim.

It also demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in evidence retrieval for verification [68, 97, 102]. The model assigns a predicted score, 𝑠𝑟 𝑐,𝑑, representing the semantic relevance for a document 𝑑 to a claim 𝑐 as defined in Equation 1. 𝑓 (𝑐, 𝑑) → 𝑠𝑟 𝑐,𝑑, 𝑠 𝑟 𝑐,𝑑 ∈ ( 0, 1) (1) MultiVerS is the best-performing verifier model on SciFact [ 97, 102]. We reproduced this model using the official implementation1 while adjusting the negative sampling parameter from 20 to 5 to avoid over-fitted verification feedback. The model predicts the veri- fication outcome as per the calculated probabilities for a document 𝑑 either supporting 𝑝𝑟 𝑐,𝑑, refuting 𝑝𝑠 𝑐,𝑑 or providing insufficient in- formation 𝑝𝑛 𝑐,𝑑, relative to a claim 𝑐, as follows: 𝑉 (𝑐, 𝑑) = 𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑎𝑥 (𝑝𝑟 𝑐,𝑑, 𝑝𝑛 𝑐,𝑑, 𝑝𝑠 𝑐,𝑑 ) (2) +Verification (Ideal Reranker Model) combines semantic relevance and verification feedback to refine evidential retrieval. The final retrieval score is calculated by summing the semantic score (𝑠𝑟 𝑐,𝑑) and the verification probabilities (𝑝𝑟 𝑐,𝑑 and 𝑝𝑛 𝑐,𝑑), followed
