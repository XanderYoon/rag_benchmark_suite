retrieval methods often operate at the sentence or paragraph level, neglecting the long-range context and the structured nature of scientific documents. Additionally, large language models (LLMs) struggle to accurately associate claims with the appropriate sec- tions, leading to potential misinterpretations and inconsistencies. A promising research direction is adaptive section-aware ev- idence retrieval, which dynamically adjusts retrieval strategies based on document structure and claim types. This approach con- sists of two key components: Claim-evidence matching. Claims should first be matched to the most relevant sections. For instance, experiment-driven claims, such as “X method improves accuracy compared to Y, ” should pri- marily retrieve evidence from the ‘Results’ and ‘Conclusion’ sec- tions, as these contain empirical findings. In contrast, background or theoretical claims, such as “X method is widely used in Y applica- tions, ” should focus on the Introduction and Background sections, which provide foundational knowledge. Prioritising section-aware evidence retrieval helps filter irrelevant context and reduces re- trieval noise. Contextual expansion. After retrieving primary evidence, the system should augment it with relevant contextual information from other sections to improve interpretability. For example, method- ological details from the ‘Analysis’ section can provide additional support for experimental claims, while historical context from the Background section can clarify theoretical claims. Access to the full document allows for retrieving finer-grained evidence or comple- mentary details that fragmented approaches may overlook. In summary, an effective adaptive section-aware retrieval sys- tem must overcome challenges in accurately parsing document structures, prioritising relevant sections based on claim types, and efficiently handling conflicting evidence. By integrating structured document parsing, hierarchical retrieval strategies, and context- aware reasoning, future systems can leverage richer evidence from full-paper scientific literature while reducing LLM hallucinations. Advancing these techniques will enhance the reliability and inter- pretability of scientific fact-checking systems. 6 Multimodal content in Science Scientific
