venue reputa- tion, methodological rigour, and experimental transparency. High- impact journals and prestigious conferences generally enforce strin- gent peer-review standards, contributing to the credibility of pub- lished research. Similarly, the expertise and prior contributions of an author, particularly in reputable venues, can provide further insight into the credibility of a study. In addition to traditional metadata, emerging indicators such as replication status, data avail- ability, and adherence to reporting guidelines can further reflect methodological soundness. Although metadata-based credibility assessment is a useful heuristic, it is not foolproof. For example, selective reporting and statistical manipulation still exist, as some widely cited studies have later been retracted due to methodolog- ical flaws [31]. While the integration of such metadata remains a reasonable approach, as these indicators generally correlate with lit- erature quality, their limitations must be acknowledged, given that even widely cited studies can occasionally be subject to retraction due to undetected methodological flaws. 8 Scientific terminology complexity Scientific fact-checking systems often encounter challenges when aligning claims with supporting evidence due to mismatches in terminology granularity [101, 107]. The prevalence of hierarchical and synonymous scientific terms introduces significant challenges in fact verification. Many concepts exist at multiple levels of speci- ficity, where broader categories encompass more specific subtypes, leading to ambiguity in claim-evidence alignment. This issue is further exacerbated by high token-level similarity among related terms, making it difficult for models to differentiate between general and specific concepts. As a result, models often misinterpret evi- dence relevance, increasing the likelihood of incorrect verification outcomes. This issue arises when a claim uses a broad term, while the sup- porting evidence provides a more specific instance, or vice versa. As in the following example, such mismatches can lead to incor- rect veracity assignments, as existing models struggle to recognise hierarchical relationships between concepts. Claim:
