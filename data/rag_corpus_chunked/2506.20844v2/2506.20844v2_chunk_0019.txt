weighting based on temporal relevance. Recent evidence should be prioritised through higher weights, while older evidence should serve as supplementary or contextual information rather than pri- mary evidence. By processing outdated evidence differently across retrieval and verification components, this direction explores how temporal in- formation can reduce noise and improve the reliability of scientific fact-checking systems. 4.2 Indirect evidence through citation General fact-checking faces a number of challenges when attempt- ing to determine the timeliness of evidence: (1) Lack of publication timestamp [8]. Many fact-checking sources, such as Wikipedia and fact-checking websites, do not provide precise publication dates for individual sentences or paragraphs. Instead, they record only the last edited timestamp, which does not accurately reflect when a fact was first published. (2) Tracking the origin of evidence. Evidence is often copied or paraphrased across multiple sources, making it difficult to determine the original publication date of a statement. (3) Search engine bias in retrieval . Pre-established fact-checking datasets retrieve evidence using top-k search engine results, where ranking mechanisms may prioritise recent documents due to time- aware ranking biases. This can misrepresent the actual chronology of claims and lead to fragmented evidence, making time extraction unreliable. While these challenges also affect scientific fact-checking, they can be naturally mitigated by leveraging full-text papers rather than abstract-only sources. The main advantages of using full-text papers include: (1) Explicit publication metadata: Each piece of literature has a clearly defined publication date, ensuring accurate temporal tracking. (2) Citation tracing for indirect evidence : Mandatory cita- tion rules in academic publications facilitate source tracing, even when statements are referenced indirectly. (3) Structured nature of academic papers : provides an indication of the origin of state- ments. For example, evidence in the background section typically references prior studies, whereas those in the abstract or results sections
