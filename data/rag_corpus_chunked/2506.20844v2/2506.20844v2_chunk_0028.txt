image-text verification using web-sourced data, but sci- entific domains present greater challenges: figures are densely struc- tured, often span multiple sections, and require domain-specific understanding capability. We argue that scientific fact-checking should shift toward full- paper analysis, where structured elements are interpreted along- side their textual context. Unlike standalone multimodal models, document-level processing enables cross-referencing between fig- ures/tables/charts and their descriptions, facilitating more faithful and complete verification. RD.6. Multi-modal Evidence Alignment Scientific fact-checking requires integrating evidence across multi- ple modalities, including text, tables, and figures, to ensure consis- tency and completeness. Recent multimodal information retrieval datasets in the scientific domain [ 71, 110] provide aligned pairs of textual and structured content, offering a foundation for cross- modal reasoning. However, in real scientific documents, structured elements, such as figures and tables, are not always located close to their descriptive text, making alignment a non-trivial challenge. A promising direction is to explicitly align structured elements with their corresponding textual explanations within the same document. In scientific articles, tables and figures are typically ex- plained through captions or surrounding sentences. Layout-aware parsing techniques can help identify these elements and link them to relevant text spans. Once aligned, their contents can be jointly encoded, enabling claim verification that draws on both structured data and contextual text. This alignment facilitates more coherent retrieval and reasoning across modalities, improving the reliability of multimodal fact-checking. This unified framework contrasts with traditional multimodal systems that process each modality in isolation. Effective alignment demands progress in scientific document understanding [24, 60], visual structure parsing [ 32], and domain-specific retrieval [ 71]. Integrating these efforts will support full-document, multimodal verification, where structured evidence is faithfully grounded in its textual context. 7 Credibility of scientific literature Existing evidence retrieval models often favour high-ranking doc- uments based on semantic relevance, often overlooking
