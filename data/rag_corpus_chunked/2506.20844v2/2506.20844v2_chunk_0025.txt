long-context scientific literature – not only for raw PDFs but also for plain-text documents. In addition to their length, scientific papers follow a structured format that introduces additional challenges for verification. Back- ground and introduction sections often cite prior work, which may conflict with conclusions drawn later, while discussion sec- tions highlight limitations that can cast doubt on earlier findings. These internally inconsistent signals may introduce misleading information, demanding reasoning that accounts for both the fac- tual assertions and the functional roles of different sections. Pars- ing scientific documents into structured units enables a modular pipeline where retrieval and verification can be independently opti- mised. This modular structure facilitates interpretability, robustness, and denoising of conflicting or irrelevant content. Layout-aware tools offer a practical foundation for such structure-aware process- ing [19, 32, 41, 56, 81], as illustrated in Figure 3. ICTIR ’25, July 18, 2025, Padua, Italy Xingyu Deng, Xi Wang, Mark Stevenson To address these challenges, we advocate for a retrieval frame- work that explicitly considers the document structure commonly found within scientific literature. Such a system should identify targeted evidence, capture long-range context across sections, and suppress irrelevant or conflicting content. We next outline a direc- tion toward adaptive, section-aware retrieval strategies designed to meet these requirements. RD.5. Adaptive Section-A ware Evidence Retrieval Scientific literature follows a structured format where different sec- tions serve distinct functions, presenting challenges for traditional evidence retrieval and verification in fact-checking systems. Exist- ing retrieval methods often operate at the sentence or paragraph level, neglecting the long-range context and the structured nature of scientific documents. Additionally, large language models (LLMs) struggle to accurately associate claims with the appropriate sec- tions, leading to potential misinterpretations and inconsistencies. A promising research direction is adaptive section-aware ev- idence retrieval, which dynamically adjusts retrieval strategies based on document
