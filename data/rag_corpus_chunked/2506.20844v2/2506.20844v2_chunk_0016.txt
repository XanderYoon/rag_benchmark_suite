for relevance-labelled supervision, which is often infeasi- ble in scientific fact-checking due to sparse annotations. Inspired by prior RLT and stopping method work, such a learned policy could optimise both efficiency and factual accuracy by aligning truncation decisions with downstream verification performance. 4 Time and Citation General fact-checking evidence corpus such as Wikipedia and fact- checking websites, often lack sentence-level evidence timestamps, making it difficult to determine the original publish time of sentence evidence in verification and hindering the development of time- aware retrieval methods. Timeliness is important in fact-checking, but in science, evolving evidence makes outdated studies particu- larly problematic. For instance, early COVID-19 treatment studies Table 5: Results of health QA task considering the different thresholds of the published time of literature [99] Year Precision Recall F1 score ≥2020 59.7 60.3 58.7 ≥2018 59.6 58.0 57.9 ≥2015 61.1 56.0 53.9 ≥2010 63.4 55.6 52.8 ≥2005 68.1 56.5 52.0 ≥2000 66.1 56.8 51.8 ≥1990 65.6 55.4 51.3 ≥1980 64.2 54.7 50.0 were later refuted, and outdated evidence may lead to harmful de- cisions. This section discusses whether scientific publications are more suitable for time-aware fact-checking and explores possible ways to leverage their inherent temporal characteristics. 4.1 Timeliness of evidence Unlike general fact-checking, where historical and static facts re- main unchanged, scientific knowledge continuously evolves. This fundamental difference necessitates time-aware retrieval in scien- tific fact-checking to ensure that retrieved evidence remain valid and reflective of the latest scientific consensus. A time-sensitive retrieval mechanism should prioritise recent publications to en- sure that fact-checking systems incorporate the most up-to-date methodologies and factual updates. This is especially crucial in fields like healthcare, where relying on outdated information could lead to misleading conclusions or incorrect decisions. For example, during a rapidly evolving pandemic, a medical treatment initially considered effective might later be deemed unreliable.
