issue is the data variety with the unstructured nature of the data, which is often dispersed across various systems and exists in different formats, such as PDFs, images, and other document types. Pre-processing this data and extracting relevant information requires substantial effort [A,E,I,M]. Another practical challenge identified was access management . Not all users should have access to all data, and it is crucial to ensure that data from one project does not overlap with another. Interviewees highlighted that managing data access and maintaining project-specific data boundaries were significant challenges during implementation [D,E,F,H,J]. Another key issue emphasized by participants is identity recognition . Specifically, it can be challenging to determine whether two entries refer to the same entity or simply share a similar name [I,H]. Participant H recommended implementing a unified identity management system across the organization. Such a system simplifies the process of identifying and linking entities, thereby reducing confusion and minimizing errors. This problem is further complicated by the use of abbreviations [I]. In many cases, the same abbreviation can represent different concepts across documents, making it challenging to ensure that the RAG system retrieves the correct meaning in each context. To address conflicts in identity recognition and abbreviations, participant I opted to use ontologies within a knowledge graph instead of a vector database. This approach helps ensure that entities are correctly linked, unambiguously referenced, and also supports the identification of synonyms or abbreviations. Moreover, certain types of data—such as addresses or product pages—are often highly similar, making it challenging to distinguish between them accurately [B,K] To solve these challenges, the critical importance of data quality was highlighted [A,M]. They recommended investing substantial time and effort in data preparation, as high-quality data leads to significantly better results.
