was the rationale for choosing RAG over other technologies, such as standalone LLMs. One key reason was the ability to easily update and expand the knowledge base with company-specific information [C,E,L]. This offered greater flexibility compared to fine-tuning a model, which is more static and resource-intensive. With RAG, the underlying LLM could also be swapped out for a more advanced model as they become available, without the need to retrain from scratch [E]. Participants also noted that RAG can reduce hallucinations and generally improve the quality and reliability of the output by grounding responses in retrieved, contextually relevant documents [C,H,J,K,L]. The most frequently mentioned goal was to save time and increase efficiency in daily work processes [A,D,F,G,I,M]. This objective is closely linked to reducing the workload on human resources [B,I]. Participants explained that by using RAG, less time was spent on manual information retrieval, allowing employees to focus on more value-added tasks. An additional advantage of RAG is the easy access to relevant information without the need for complex search queries [A,C,H,I], especially when it is fragmented across various departments or held by multiple individuals [A]. Participants emphasized the importance of centralizing and structuring this dispersed knowledge to ensure effective use. Additionally, RAG was seen as a way to reduce knowledge dependency on specific individuals—mitigating the risk of knowledge loss when key personnel leave the company [I]. This points to broader opportunities, such as enabling company growth without a proportional increase in human resources, due to improved efficiency and automation [B]. Furthermore, participants noted that accelerating the information retrieval process helps employees maintain focus . Instead of being interrupted or distracted by time-consuming documentation searches, they can stay engaged with their core tasks [D]. A final consideration is the future development of RAG systems and their expanding capabilities. One emerging
