we draft analytical categories compiling them into a coding guide with definitions and variants, leading to the four RQs. 3. We then code the interview using predefined categories to enable comparison, making adjustments through team consensus when necessary. 4. After the coding, we present the total overview and mapping, in most cases, in a table-like way. 5. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of related cases through repeated readings, knowledge extraction, and textual synthesis, which are then integrated into the written paper. In addition, to answer RQ2, we first performed a rapid literature review to derive implementation-relevant requirements for RAG systems. Subsequently, we used descriptive statistics to evaluate how these 12 predefined requirements were assessed during our interview study. Therefore, the participants were asked to rate the 12 predefined requirements on a scale from 1 to 10 based on their importance. This provided an overview of where the actual focus lies and helped us understand which requirements are considered important, which are seen as difficult to achieve, and why some may be intentionally prioritized. More details and the complete replication package are provided on our Zenodo repository [Brehme et al., 2025a]. 4 Findings 4.1 RQ1: Use Case and Goals We collected use cases through interviews and, based on our coding, identified similarities with those 2Company Size based on OECD [OECD, 2017]: Small Comp.
