importance placed on continuous learning. Therefore, continuous operation remains relevant but is considered of moderate priority compared to continuous learning. Integration in Setup describes the requirement that the RAG system can be seamlessly integrated into the existing technical infrastructure. For example, the company has contracts with a service provider, already uses its services, and prefers to remain within this environment. This includes ensuring compatibility with current databases, cloud services, and other components already in use. The importance of this requirement varied depending on the company’s context. For one participant [F], integration was less critical because they were able to build the RAG system from scratch without relying on existing services. Conversely, in larger organizations with established contracts and infrastructures, adapting the RAG system to fit into existing technologies was necessary and therefore more important [H]. Overall, this requirement was rated as moderately relevant, with even those who considered it important assigning relatively low scores. Scalability addresses two dimensions that we consider: scaling the number of users and inputs, and scaling the knowledge base of the RAG system. Some participants generally believed that scaling is straightforward since most LLMs are accessed via APIs that inherently support scaling [A,F]. Similarly, cloud-based data storage solutions make scaling the knowledge base manageable without significant challenges. One participant mentioned that this requirement is seen as less important because some companies are still in the pilot phase and intend to address scaling at a later stage [E]. Costs encompass all expenses related to both the development and operation of the RAG system. This requirement was considered very relevant by some participants [C,H,I,M], who gave it ratings above eight. On the other hand, it was rated as less relevant by others, for various reasons. Some participants noted that the cost of LLM usage is expected to decrease
