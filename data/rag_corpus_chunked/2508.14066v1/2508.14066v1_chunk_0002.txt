to their specific applications in corporate environments [Arslan et al., 2024]. This study aims to bridge this gap by examining the practical use of RAG systems in industry through an investigation of four key aspects—(1) their use cases, (2) the requirements set by companies, (3) the technical and organizational challenges encountered, and (4) the methods practitioners use to evaluate their quality—resulting in four research questions. Building on [Arslan et al., 2024] six-category classification of industrial RAG applications, we investigated through our interviews which use cases are most prevalent and how they align with this framework: RQ1: How have companies applied RAG in their use cases and what opportunities do companies see when using RAG systems? To identify key factors for the practical deployment of RAG systems, we conducted a literature review and analyzed how companies address them, resulting in 12 industry-relevant requirements (e.g., security and data protection). Our goal was to capture practical, real-world perspectives rather than purely theoretical ones by investigating: RQ2: What requirements do companies set for RAG systems, and how are these requirements implemented in practice? Furthermore, we aim to identify common challenges companies face when implementing RAG systems, as repeated mistakes can lead to wasted resources. By understanding these challenges and how they are addressed, we can help inform more effective adoption strategies and implementation guidelines. Following, our interviews also explored lessons learned during implementation and whether industry practices reflect improvements suggested in the literature, such as those outlined by [Zhao et al., 2024]. Based on these insights, we provide practical recommendations on key priorities and common pitfalls to avoid when adopting RAG systems. RQ3: What challenges do companies face when implementing and using RAG systems, and what lessons have been learned from these experiences? Lastly, we investigate how industry practitioners assess the quality of their
