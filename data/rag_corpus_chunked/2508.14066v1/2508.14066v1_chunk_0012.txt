increase in human resources, due to improved efficiency and automation [B]. Furthermore, participants noted that accelerating the information retrieval process helps employees maintain focus . Instead of being interrupted or distracted by time-consuming documentation searches, they can stay engaged with their core tasks [D]. A final consideration is the future development of RAG systems and their expanding capabilities. One emerging direction is the evolution toward agentic RAGs [A,D,G,M], where these systems acquire decision-making abilities and operate autonomously within defined workflows. This concept is already being explored in research [Singh et al., 2025a] and is likely to be adopted by industry in the near future. Another significant advancement is the shift toward multimodal RAGs [G], which can process and analyze diverse input types—such as text, images, and structured data—rather than being limited to a single document format. This development will further enhance RAG pipelines, enabling more versatile and powerful applications. 4.2 RQ2: Requirements For effective implementation, RAG systems require a well-defined set of infrastructural, technical, and organizational prerequisites. Based on our literature review, we set up a list of requirements that we aimed to validate in terms of their importance for RAG systems in industrial settings. The results of the importance scores is presented in Figure 1. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Relevance Score Ethical Licensing Costs Scalability Integration Learning Performance Explainability Usability Security Quality Privacy 3 2 3 2 4 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 2 2 6 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 3 4 5 2 2 4 4 2 2 6 3 3 4Mean Figure 1: Sorted distribution of requirement relevance scores, averaged by mean.
