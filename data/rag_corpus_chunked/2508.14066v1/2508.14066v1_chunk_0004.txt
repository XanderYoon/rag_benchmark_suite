the time ethical considerations, bias mitigation, costs, and scalability are less prioritized. • One of the main challenges is data preprocessing for preparing the RAG system, which is critical for the overall system quality. • RAG systems are primarily evaluated by humans, rather than through automated methods using LLMs. 2 Related Work This section explores three key aspects: types of RAG applications, various enhancements to improve RAG systems, and approaches for evaluating their performance. RAG applications. In [Arslan et al., 2024], six main types of RAG applications in industry are identified through a comprehensive review. ( i) The most common is question answering, with examples such as medical QA tasks [Xiong et al., 2024] or commonsense QA [Sha et al., 2023]. ( ii) RAG is also widely used for text generation and summarization, for instance, generating stories with complex plots [Wen et al., 2023]. ( iii) Information retrieval and extraction represents another key area, supporting tasks like regulatory compliance QA in the pharmaceutical industry [Kim et al., 2025]. ( iv) Text analysis and preprocessing , such as sentiment classification [Mahboub et al., 2024], further illustrate how RAG systems support data understanding. ( v) In addition, RAG contributes to software development and maintenance , for example through code completion [Lu et al., 2022]. (vi) Finally, decision making and applications —such as automated cash transaction booking [Zhang et al., 2023a]—demonstrate how RAG can assist in operational processes. Enhancements to improve RAG systems. Another aspect of RAG is system enhancement, as highlighted by [Zhao et al., 2024], who identify several RAG improvements in the literature, including input enhancements as a key category. One type of input enhancement is query transformation, which involves approaches such as refining or rewriting the input query to improve retrieval effectiveness [Chan et al., 2024, Tayal and Tyagi, 2024],
