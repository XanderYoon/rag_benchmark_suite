described the use of automated evaluation methods with the help of AI [K,G]. For participant K, the system output was binary (i.e., correct or incorrect), enabling them a straightforward evaluation based on boolean values. The test dataset was constructed from anonymized historical queries, allowing for the evaluation of RAG within an existing workflow where only a system component had been replaced [K]. In interview G, an automated pipeline was implemented, utilizing an LLM to assess the quality of RAG-generated answers based on specific metrics, for instance, accuracy and tone (e.g., friendliness). Several other participants mentioned plans to implement automated testing using test datasets in the future [A,H]. Beyond response quality metrics, interaction rate exists as another frequently monitored indicator. Therefore, several participants reported tracking the number of daily requests to monitor how usage evolved over time, using this data as an indicator of user acceptance and adoption [B,C,H]. Additionally, they monitored the frequency and nature of issues encountered while interacting with the RAG system. Performance-related metrics, such as latency and system responsiveness, were also used to assess the operational quality of the RAG implementation [B]. 5 Discussion RAG systems are gaining increasing attention in industry, building on extensive research conducted over the past year [Arslan et al., 2024]. Consistent with the use cases reported by [Arslan et al., 2024], the Question Answering category emerges as the most prominent application in industrial settings. Functionalities extending beyond traditional question answering in chatbots remain uncommon and were identified in only three instances, where, for instance, a participant incorporated operational capabilities into their RAG implementation. In contrast, [Arslan et al., 2024] outline a broader set of application scenarios, which may represent the next stage of development for industrial adoption, as many companies are still in the early stages of building RAG systems. This early-
