As a result, we adapted their categorization, which is presented in Table 2. In most cases, RAG is employed to facilitate knowledge transfer by delivering information in a human-readable format through a conversational chat interface [A,B,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,L,M]. According to the categorization by [Arslan et al., 2024], this application falls under the category of question answering. These RAG systems enable users to perform targeted searches across various departments within an organization to address specific questions. For instance, one participant described using RAG to retrieve information from HR documents [D], while others accessed data from ticketing systems [F,I]. Overall, these RAG systems are primarily employed to process internal documents and extract relevant information in order to provide precise answers to user questions. Other mentioned use cases fall under theDecision Making and Application category: RAG is being extended to support operational tasks, going beyond information retrieval to perform actions such as creating support tickets or generating reports [C]. The goal is to combine the retrieval of relevant information with the execution of operational tasks. Leveraging access to internal wikis, ticketing systems, and source code repositories, the RAG system can, for example, create new tickets, initiate projects, or generate structured reports based on the retrieved information. Furthermore, RAG systems are also being adopted to replace legacy systems [M]. Last but not
