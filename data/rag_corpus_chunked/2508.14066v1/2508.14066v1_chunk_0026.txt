remain uncommon and were identified in only three instances, where, for instance, a participant incorporated operational capabilities into their RAG implementation. In contrast, [Arslan et al., 2024] outline a broader set of application scenarios, which may represent the next stage of development for industrial adoption, as many companies are still in the early stages of building RAG systems. This early- stage maturity was further reflected in our discussions about Technology Readiness Level (TRL): 12 out of 13 participants rated their use cases below TRL 7, suggesting that most RAG solutions are still in development or prototyping and have not yet reached large-scale deployment. Moreover, our findings show that all RAG implementations are currently being developed for narrowly defined use cases, such as HR or customer support, rather than as general-purpose solutions. This may be due to the complexity of tailoring retrieval and generation processes to domain-specific data, as well as concerns around accuracy, compliance, and user trust. The results suggest that organizations are prioritizing controlled, high-impact applications where the benefits of RAG can be clearly measured and risks are more easily managed. Considering the twelve key requirements across the thirteen use cases, the aspects rated as most critical were RAG/Answer Quality (average rating: 8.7), Security (8.5), and Privacy/Data Protection (8.9), while surprisingly, Ethical Considerations and Bias Awareness received comparatively low attention, with an average rating of only 5.6. From discussions with the companies, we observed that they initially focus on specific requirements to achieve early results, while also addressing other important, but less critical, requirements for success during later stages of the RAG system’s development. They remain cautious about using LLMs due to concerns over potential hallucinations and misinformation, which could result in reputational damage. One possible reason mentioned for companies’ caution is that current RAG systems do not yet
