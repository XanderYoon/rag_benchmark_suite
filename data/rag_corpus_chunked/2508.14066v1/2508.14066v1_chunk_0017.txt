[E]. Costs encompass all expenses related to both the development and operation of the RAG system. This requirement was considered very relevant by some participants [C,H,I,M], who gave it ratings above eight. On the other hand, it was rated as less relevant by others, for various reasons. Some participants noted that the cost of LLM usage is expected to decrease over time, reducing financial concerns [K,B]. Additionally, since most organizations are still in the research and development phase, cost considerations were not yet a significant challenge. Instead, the focus remains on determining the feasibility and practical implementation of RAG systems. Interviewees anticipated that cost will become a more critical factor in later stages of RAG deployment [A]. In general, it is difficult to demonstrate that the costs are justified and that improvements in efficiency are both measurable and meaningful [E]. Licensing and Copyright concerns whether the output generated by the RAG system can be used freely without infringing on copyright-protected content. This issue primarily arises from the underlying LLMs, where copyright ownership and usage rights are not always clearly defined. Some participants expressed concerns about potential legal challenges when using generated content [H,M]. However, participant B noted that such issues are increasingly being addressed, for example, through regulations like the European AI Act, which clarifies copyright ownership of AI-generated content. Overall, this requirement was not a major focus for most participants, with many either unaware of it or not considering it a pressing concern. Ethical Considerations and Bias require that the RAG system produces neutral, unbiased responses and avoids discrimination or unethical outputs. Despite the importance of ethics in AI, this requirement received the lowest relevance ratings from participants. Ethical considerations and biases were either not considered relevant to their use case [F] or had not reflected on the issue
