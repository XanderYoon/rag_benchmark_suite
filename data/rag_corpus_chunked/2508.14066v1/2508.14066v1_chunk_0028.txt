systems, though AI-driven tools and processes may offer valuable support in automating and optimizing these tasks [Sivathapandi, 2022]. However, some promising recent research findings have not yet been implemented in practice. Participants mentioned these only as part of future plans. For instance, this includes the implementation of agentic RAG systems [Singh et al., 2025b] or personalized RAGs for use over private documents [Ryan et al., 2025]. Another aspect concerns the automatic assessment of RAG quality, as exemplified by RAGAS [Singh et al., 2025b]. Surprisingly, our findings indicate that RAG evaluation in industry is predominantly performed manually, without leveraging AI-based automation. This may be attributed to the lack of domain-specific test datasets, which are expensive and labor-intensive to collect and can quickly become outdated. This discrepancy highlights again a gap between academic research, which has developed multiple automated workflows for testing RAG systems [Brehme et al., 2025b], and current industry practices. 6 Conclusion This study investigated the current state of RAG in industry through semi-structured interviews with 13 practitioners. The findings reveal a notable gap between academic advancements and industrial adoption. Industry use cases remain in the early stages of exploration, with most efforts limited to trials or pilot projects, and only a few achieving full deployment. Based on practitioners’ experiences, we identified a comprehensive list of requirements critical for RAG implementation, highlighted cross-company challenges in adopting RAG, and summarized key lessons learned from practical deployments. Furthermore, the study emphasized approaches to RAG evaluation. The limited number of interviews, predominantly from Europe, and the fact that the results reflect a specific point in time may limit the generalizability of the findings. Nonetheless, we think the consistency of responses suggests that the principal industry perspectives were effectively captured. Looking forward, despite the ongoing trial phase, we expect industry to increasingly adopt recent
