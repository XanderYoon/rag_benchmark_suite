at the 17th International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Information Retrieval (KDIR25). 1 Introduction Since 2022, Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in research and have gained widespread popularity [Google Trends, 2025]. However, they still face substantial challenges, such as hallucinations caused by insufficient context or outdated context, limited access to up-to-date domain-specific knowledge, and difficulties in verifying the accuracy of generated information [Zhang et al., 2023c, Wang et al., 2024]. To address these limitations, the concept of Retrieval- Augmented Generation (RAG) was introduced by [Lewis et al., 2021]. RAG extends LLMs by integrating external knowledge sources, enabling a https://orcid.org/0009-0009-4711-2564 b https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7713-4686 c https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1954-6412 d https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9554-0231 e https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7093-4341 them to handle for example domain specific question answering (QA) task. By incorporating domain- specific information, RAG systems can generate more accurate, relevant, and contextually appropriate responses for specialized topics, and several such systems have already demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach [Gao et al., 2024]. Since the rise in popularity of RAG systems, organizations have been trying to build them for industrial use, often relying on large amounts of confidential and proprietary knowledge that standard LLMs do not contain [Zhou et al., 2025]. By leveraging corporate knowledge, RAG systems enable companies to develop tailored use cases and perform specialized, domain-intensive tasks that meet their unique needs. However, the literature primarily focuses on the design and development of RAG systems themselves [Gao et al., 2024], with comparatively little attention given to their specific applications in corporate environments [Arslan et al., 2024]. This study aims to bridge this gap by examining the practical use of RAG systems in industry through an investigation of four key aspects—(1) their use cases, (2) the requirements set by companies, (3) the technical and organizational challenges encountered, and (4) the methods practitioners use to evaluate their
