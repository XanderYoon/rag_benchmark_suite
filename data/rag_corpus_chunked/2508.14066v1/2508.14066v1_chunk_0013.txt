Scores range from 0 (not relevant) to 10 (highly relevant). Security and Data Protection in RAG systems means to ensuring that the system cannot be compromised or “jailbroken,” and that it does not disclose data outside its intended boundaries. This includes anonymizing any confidential data and safeguarding user information against misuse. Initially, these aspects were treated as separate requirements, but based on interview feedback, we merged them into a single, interdependent requirement because they are closely related and must be addressed together. The importance of security and data protection varied depending on the use case. For internal systems accessible only by employees, this requirement was considered less critical but still relevant. However, it becomes significantly more important when the system is accessible externally [D]. Additionally, the emphasis on this requirement differed by company size and geographic region. In large companies and in Europe, where data protection regulations are strict, security was rated as highly important [I]. In contrast, one participant mentioned that in the US and Asia data protection is generally less prioritized in their contexts [J]. Overall, security and data protection were regarded as a very important requirement across most cases. RAG Quality denotes the overall quality of the responses generated by the RAG system. This includes the quality of the underlying data, the retriever component, and the generated answers. Initially, we identified RAG quality and answer quality as separate requirements, but we extended this to include data quality after it was explicitly mentioned by participants [C,D,H,I,J,M]. The intent behind this requirement is to ensure that the RAG consistently delivers
