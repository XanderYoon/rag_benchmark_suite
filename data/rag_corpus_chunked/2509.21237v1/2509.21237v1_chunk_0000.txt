QUERY-CENTRICGRAPHRETRIEVALAUGMENTED GENERATION Yaxiong Wu, Jianyuan Bo, Y ongyue Zhang, Sheng Liang, Y ong Liu Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd wu.yaxiong@huawei.com ABSTRACT Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enriches large language mod- els (LLMs) with external knowledge for long-context understanding and multi-hop reasoning, but existing methods face a granularity dilemma: fine-grained entity- level graphs incur high token costs and lose context, while coarse document-level graphs fail to capture nuanced relations. We introduce QCG-RAG, a query-centric graph RAG framework that enables query-granular indexing and multi-hop chunk retrieval. Our query-centric approach leverages Doc2Query and Doc2Query-- to construct query-centric graphs with controllable granularity, improving graph quality and interpretability. A tailored multi-hop retrieval mechanism then se- lects relevant chunks via the generated queries. Experiments on LiHuaWorld and MultiHop-RAG show that QCG-RAG consistently outperforms prior chunk-based and graph-based RAG methods in question answering accuracy, establishing a new paradigm for multi-hop reasoning. 1 INTRODUCTION Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a standard approach for improving the factuality of large language models (LLMs) by grounding them in external knowledge (Gao et al., 2023). By retrieving supporting chunk-based evidence, RAG not only enhances accuracy but also mitigates hallucinations common in LLM generation (Yu et al., 2024). However, existing chunk-based RAG pipelines often fail when queries are underspecified or require multi-hop reasoning, due to a mis- match between query intent and the fragmented distribution of supporting chunk-level evidence in retrieval (Tang & Yang, 2024). Graph-based RAG provides a more effective strategy for capturing relational knowledge and asso- ciating dispersed evidence across documents (Peng et al., 2024; Han et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2025) compared to chunk-based RAG. In particular, GraphRAG (Edge et al., 2024a) constructs a fine- grained entity-centric knowledge graph (KG) with community summaries, allowing retrieval to exploit both text similarity and entity-level connections. This fine-grained KG strengthens semantic coherence across dispersed
