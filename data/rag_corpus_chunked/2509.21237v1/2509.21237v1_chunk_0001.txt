knowledge and asso- ciating dispersed evidence across documents (Peng et al., 2024; Han et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2025) compared to chunk-based RAG. In particular, GraphRAG (Edge et al., 2024a) constructs a fine- grained entity-centric knowledge graph (KG) with community summaries, allowing retrieval to exploit both text similarity and entity-level connections. This fine-grained KG strengthens semantic coherence across dispersed entity-level evidence, thereby enabling deeper contextual understanding. GraphRAG is especially effective for multi-hop reasoning and long context understanding, enabling applications in question answering over massive documents (Ghassel et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2024) and long dialogues (Fan et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025b). However, existing graph-based RAG methods face a fundamental trade-off: fine-grained entity- level graphs incur prohibitive token costs and often lose semantic coherence, while coarse-grained document-level graphs sacrifice nuanced relations. For instance, GraphRAG imposes considerable computational overhead: constructing fine-grained entity-level graphs and producing community summaries inflate token budgets and inference cost, and can erode contextual coherence (Min et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025a). Recent work simplifies graph construction by skipping community detec- tion and summarization, and instead using lightweight information extractors (e.g., SpaCy (Honnibal et al., 2020)) or fine-tuned small LLMs (e.g., Phi-3-3.8B (Abdin et al., 2024), but at the cost of lower graph quality. Other efforts adopt hierarchical index graphs with document-level links (Chen et al., 2024), which are efficient but too coarse to support nuanced reasoning. These limitations highlight the need for strategies that balance granularity and effectiveness in graph-based RAG.
