over QCG, whereas Naive RAG fails. RQ3: What are the effects of QCG nodes in QCG-RAG?Figure 4 presents an ablation study on different node choices in QCG-RAG. The full model, which uses concatenatedQuery+Answeras nodes, consistently achieves the best accuracy on both LiHuaWorld and MultiHop-RAG. Using only queries (QCG w/ Query) yields competitive but lower performance, while using only answers (QCG w/ Answer) results in a substantial drop, highlighting that queries provide essential semantic grounding while answers alone lack sufficient context. Moreover, replacing the 72B-based Doc2Query with a smaller generator (Doc2Query w/ 7B) leads to reduced performance, indicating that graph quality benefits from stronger generators but ultimately depends more on node formulation than model size alone. Finally, constructing graphs with sentence-level nodes (Sentence Nodes) underperforms QCG, 8 (a) Top-αPercentile (b) KNNk (c) Max Nodesn Figure 5: Ablation studies of QCG-RAG on LiHuaWorld.

Overall, these results demonstrate that QCG nodes, particularly theQuery+Answer concatenation, are critical to achieving robust retrieval and reasoning performance. RQ4: How do the hyperparameters, such as α, k and n, affect the performance of QCG- RAG?Figures 5 and 6 present ablations of key hyperparameters in QCG-RAG: (a) the effect of query truncation at the top- α percentile under different chunking strategies; (b) the effect of the number of nearest neighbors per node k under different embedding models; and (c) the effect of the maximum number of retrieved query nodes n under different similarity thresholds γ. First, the query truncation top-α percentile (Figures 5a, 6a) shows a clear upward trend from 20% to 80%, after which performance plateaus or slightly decreases, suggesting that moderate query pruning effectively balances noise reduction and coverage.
