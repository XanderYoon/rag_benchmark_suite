The instance is shown in Use Case D.2. In addition, the generated Query+Answer text information corresponding to topk qids and extra qids via knn is presented in the Detail section. The q id consists of a document ID x, a chunk ID y, and a generation index z, in the format “x-y-z” (by default, 20 queries are generated, so z∈[0,19] ). For example, “20261221 12:00-0-1” denotes the chunk “20261221 12:00”, with “0” as the chunk ID and “1” as the generation index. From the use case, it can be seen that QCG-RAG, by directly retrieving generated Query+Answer pairs, can accurately match those produced by the “ 20261219 19:00-0,” and “ 20261228 10:00-0” chunks, as well as the query associated with the chunk “20261221 12:00-0” that contains all correct answers: {"q_id": "20261221_12:00-0-14", "query": "What does Yuriko Yamamoto
