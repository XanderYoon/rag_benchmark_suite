(a) LiHuaWorld and (b) MultiHop-RAG. points, demonstrating that query-centric indexing substantially improves retrieval quality and answer correctness. On the more challenging multi-hop subsets, QCG-RAG notably outperforms prior graph- based methods: 62.12% vs. 57.58% (LightRAG) on LiHuaWorld multi-hop, and 74.59% vs. 71.82% (LightRAG) on MultiHop-RAG comparison queries. Importantly, QCG-RAG maintains competitive performance across null queries (73.85% / 77.27%), showing robustness against unanswerable cases where many graph-based baselines degrade sharply. These results confirm that balancing graph granularity via query-centric construction yields stronger semantic alignment, leading to superior QA accuracy across both long-term personal memory and news-based multi-hop reasoning tasks. RQ2: Why does QCG-RAG improve QA performance for multi-hop questions?Figure 3 shows the effect of hop size h on QA accuracy across LiHuaWorld and MultiHop-RAG. QCG- RAG consistently outperforms Naive RAG under all hop settings, with the largest gains observed for one-hop and two-hop settings. For instance, on MultiHop-RAG, QCG-RAG ( k=3) improves accuracy from 75.8% (Naive RAG) to nearly 80%, demonstrating stronger multi-hop reasoning. This advantage arises because query-centric graphs explicitly encode query-to-query and query-to- chunk relations, enabling effective expansion from initial retrieved queries to semantically related neighbors. By leveraging these structured connections, QCG-RAG can capture dispersed evidence across documents and integrate it into coherent reasoning chains, thereby addressing the limitations of chunk-only retrieval that often misses intermediate links. Case studies on both datasets are provided in Appendix D to illustrate scenarios where QCG-RAG succeeds in deriving correct answers through multi-hop retrieval over QCG, whereas Naive RAG fails. RQ3: What are the effects of QCG nodes in QCG-RAG?Figure 4 presents an ablation study on different node choices in QCG-RAG. The full model, which uses concatenatedQuery+Answeras nodes, consistently achieves the best accuracy on both LiHuaWorld and MultiHop-RAG. Using only queries (QCG w/ Query) yields competitive but lower performance, while using only answers (QCG
