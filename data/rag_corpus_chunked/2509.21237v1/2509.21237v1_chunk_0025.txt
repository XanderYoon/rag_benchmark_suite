trun- cation ratio, h denotes the number of retrieval hops, k specifies the number of retrieved query nodes, n is the number of neighbors per node, and γ is the similarity threshold. Unless otherwise specified, reported results correspond to the default settings. C LLM PROMPTS We show LLM prompts for query generation and answer evaluation, including Doc2Query Prompt, Response Generation Prompt, and Evaluation Prompt. C.1 DOC2QUERYPROMPT To generate diverse supervision signals for query-centric graph construction, we adopted a standard- ized Doc2Query prompt. This prompt instructs the model to produce multiple distinct queries from each text chunk, along with exact answers grounded in the chunk. The full prompt is shown in Prompt C.1. Prompt C.1: Doc2Query Prompt ---Role--- You are a **Doc2Query** assistant. ---Goal--- Given a text chunk, generate 20 distinct user queries that can be directly answered by that chunk. For each query, also provide an exact answer and a relevance score. ---Generation rules--- 1. **Answerability** - Every query must be answerable using only information in the chunk. 2. **Comprehensive coverage ** - Collectively, the all generated queries should cover all key ideas in the chunk from different viewpoints or levels of detail. 3. **Diversity requirements ** - Ensure diversity along the following dimensions: - *Question-style variety * - Mix interrogative forms (who/what/why/ how/where/when/did), imperative prompts ("List...", "Summarize ..."), comparative questions, conditional or speculative forms, etc. - *Content-perspective variety * - Include queries on facts, definitions, methods, reasons, outcomes, examples, comparisons, limitations, and so on. - *Information granularity * - Combine macro (overall purpose, high- level summary) and micro (specific figures, terms, steps) queries. - *User-intent variety * - Simulate intents such as confirmation, evaluation, usability, diagnosis, and decision-making (e.g., "Is this approach more efficient than ...?"). 14 - *Linguistic expression variety * - Vary wording, syntax (active <--> passive),
