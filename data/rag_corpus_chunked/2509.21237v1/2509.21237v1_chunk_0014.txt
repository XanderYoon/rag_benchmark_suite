andγ= 1.0. Details of the implementation can be found in Appendix B. We adopt Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct (Team, 2024) for query generation to build query- centric graphs, and use Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct for comparison. We also employ Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct for question answering and response evaluation within theLLM-as-a- Judgeframework. The LLM prompts are provided in Appendix C. To assess the impact of node choice on QCG-RAG performance, we also conduct an ablation on node formulations using both LiHuaWorld and MultiHop-RAG. Specifically, we compare four variants: (1) QCG w/ Query, where only queries are used as nodes; (2)QCG w/ Answer, where only answers are used as nodes; (3)Doc2Query w/ 7B, where queries are generated by Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct; and (4)Sentence Nodes, where each sentence forms a graph node. The default setting of QCG-RAG employs concatenatedQuery+Answernodes. 4.2 EXPERIMENTALRESULTS RQ1: How does QCG-RAG perform in QA compared with baselines?Table 1 reports accuracy across LiHuaWorld and MultiHop-RAG. Overall, QCG-RAG achieves the best performance among all baselines, with an average accuracy of 73.16% on LiHuaWorld and 79.60% on MultiHop-RAG. Compared to Naive RAG (65.78% / 75.80%), QCG-RAG yields consistent gains of +7.4 and +3.8 4https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/ms-graphrag-neo4j 7 (a) LiHua World (b) MultiHop-RAG Figure 3: QA performance with zero-hop, one-hop, and two-hop retrieval over Query-Centric Graphs (QCG) on (a) LiHuaWorld and (b) MultiHop-RAG.

On the more challenging multi-hop subsets, QCG-RAG notably outperforms prior graph- based methods: 62.12% vs. 57.58% (LightRAG) on LiHuaWorld multi-hop, and 74.59% vs. 71.82% (LightRAG) on MultiHop-RAG comparison queries. Importantly, QCG-RAG maintains competitive performance across null queries (73.85% / 77.27%), showing robustness against
