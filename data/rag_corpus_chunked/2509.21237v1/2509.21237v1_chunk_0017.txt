node k under different embedding models; and (c) the effect of the maximum number of retrieved query nodes n under different similarity thresholds γ. First, the query truncation top-α percentile (Figures 5a, 6a) shows a clear upward trend from 20% to 80%, after which performance plateaus or slightly decreases, suggesting that moderate query pruning effectively balances noise reduction and coverage. Second, the number of the nearest neighbors per node k (Figures 5b, 6b) peaks around k= 3 , reflecting that too few neighbors restrict multi-hop associations on QCG, whereas too many introduce noisy or redundant connections. Finally, the maximum number of retrieved nodes n (Figures 5c, 6c) achieves optimal performance when set between 10 and 15. A smaller n (e.g., 5) limits retrieval coverage, while a larger n (e.g., 20) introduces noisy queries that degrade accuracy. Overall, the findings underscore that carefully balanced hyperparameters (e.g., α=80%, k=3, n=15) are crucial for QCG-RAG, as they enable adequate evidence coverage while avoiding redundancy and noise from excessive expansion. 5 CONCLUSION We presented QCG-RAG, a query-centric graph retrieval-augmented generation framework that addresses the granularity dilemma in existing graph-based RAG methods. Unlike prior approaches that rely on either coarse document-level graphs or fine-grained entity-centric graphs, QCG-RAG constructs controllable-granularity query-centric graphs by leveraging Doc2Query and Doc2Query- -, and employs a tailored multi-hop retrieval process over these graphs. Extensive experiments on LiHuaWorld and MultiHop-RAG demonstrate that QCG-RAG consistently outperforms both chunk-based and graph-based baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multi-hop and long-context question answering. Our ablations further show that query formulation, node design, and balanced hyperparameter settings are critical to performance. 9 LIMITATIONS While QCG-RAG advances the state of graph-based retrieval-augmented generation, it still has several limitations. First, the framework depends on query generation quality; errors or biases in Doc2Query may propagate into graph construction and retrieval.
