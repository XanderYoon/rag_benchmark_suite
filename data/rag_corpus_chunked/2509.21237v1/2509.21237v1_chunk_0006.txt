space, where each chunk ci is used as a prompt to an LLM to generate multiple synthetic query: Qg,i ={q 1 g,i, q2 g,i, . . . , qM g,i}, where qj g,i(j∈[1, M]) denotes a generated query that is grounded in the chunk content of ci. M is the number of generated queries per chunk ci. This document expansion allows the retrieval module to associate user queries not only with explicit surface forms of chunks, but also with semantically aligned synthetic queries. 2https://github.com/circlemind-ai/fast-graphrag 3https://huggingface.co/SciPhi/Triplex 3 Figure 2: Overview of our proposed QCG-RAG framework, which consists of (a) Query-Centric Graph Construction and (b) Query-Centric Graph Retrieval & Generation. Doc2Query--.Doc2Query-- (Gospodinov et al., 2023) is a further filtering step to mitigate noise introduced by synthetic queries. Specifically, the semantic similarity is computed between each generated query qj g,i and its originating chunk ci, denoted sim(qj g,i, ci). The generated queries are ranked by similarity and only the topα-fraction (withα∈(0,1]) are retained: Qα g,i =Top-α  qj g,i |sim(q j g,i, ci) . This maintains synthetic queries faithfulness toc i while improving retrieval precision. Standard RAG Pipeline.In the RAG framework, the retrieval component returns a ranked list of top-K chunks Ctop-K ={c 1, . . . , cK} based on a similarity function sim(q, c), often instantiated by dense embedding retrievers. The generation component then produces the final response: a=LLM qu | Ctop-K  . We use this setting, augmented with extended Doc2Query and Doc2Query--, as the basis for introduc- ing our proposed Query-Centric Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (QCG-RAG) framework. 3.2 FRAMEWORKOVERVIEW Prior graph-based RAG approaches exhibit inherent limitations in granularity: either too fine- grained with entity-level graphs or too coarse-grained with document-level graphs. To address this granularity dilemma, we proposeQuery-Centric Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (QCG-RAG), a novel framework that integrates Query-Centric Graph
