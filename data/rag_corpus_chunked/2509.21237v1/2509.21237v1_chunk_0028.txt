C.3 EVALUATIONPROMPT To ensure consistent and transparent evaluation of candidate answers generated by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), we employed a standardized prompt for judgment. The prompt specifies the evaluation role, criteria, and output format, focusing on factual accuracy and completeness. The full evaluation prompt is shown in Prompt C.3. Prompt C.3: Evaluation Prompt ---Role--- You are a helpful evaluation assistant. You will be given a question, a gold-standard answer, and a candidate answer generated via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). ---Goal--- Evaluate the candidate answer against the gold-standard answer based on factual accuracy and completeness in answering the question. Scoring Criteria: - score=1 (Correct): The candidate answer is factually accurate and fully or reasonably paraphrases the gold-standard answer. - score=0 (Incorrect): The candidate answer is factually incorrect, irrelevant, incomplete, or does not answer the question. ---Output Format--- Provide your evaluation in the following JSON format: { "score": X } where X is either 1 or 0. 16 D CASESTUDIES D.1 A CASESTUDY ONLIHUAWORLD We present an example of question answering with supporting evidence chunks on LiHuaWorld in Example D.1. From the example, it can be observed that the supporting evidence chunks “20261219 19:00-0”, “20261220 20:00-0”, and “20261228 10:00-0” provide only one part of the answer, namely “LiHua,” whereas “20261221 12:00-0” contains all answer entities: “LiHua,” “Chae Song-hwa,” and “Yuriko Yamamoto.” Example D.1: An example of question answering on LiHuaWorld { "question": "Who knows about Wolfgang going to Hong Kong?", "answer": "LiHua & Chae & Yuriko", "type": "Multi", "evidence": [ {"doc_id": "20261219_19:00", "chunk_id": "20261219_19:00-0", "chunk": "WolfgangSchulz: Hey!
