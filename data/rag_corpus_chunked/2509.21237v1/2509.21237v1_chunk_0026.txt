comparisons, limitations, and so on. - *Information granularity * - Combine macro (overall purpose, high- level summary) and micro (specific figures, terms, steps) queries. - *User-intent variety * - Simulate intents such as confirmation, evaluation, usability, diagnosis, and decision-making (e.g., "Is this approach more efficient than ...?"). 14 - *Linguistic expression variety * - Vary wording, syntax (active <--> passive), and synonyms; avoid repeating near-identical phrases. - *No redundancy * - Each query must be meaningfully distinct; eliminate trivial rephrases that offer no new angle. - *Chunk-grounded specificity * - Queries must be grounded in specific factual points from the chunk. Avoid vague or generic formulations such as "What did X say?" or "Tell me more about Y" that lack anchoring in actual content. 4. **Required fields ** - Each output item must be based on the given chunk and include the following fields: - **query** - A question or search phrase a user might ask. - **answer** - A concise answer taken verbatim (or nearly verbatim ) from the chunk. ---Example--- 1. **Input Chunk ** - Alice met with Bob at the Central Cafe on Tuesday to discuss their upcoming collaborative research project. During the meeting, Bob suggested incorporating advanced AI methodologies into their experimental design, which Alice enthusiastically supported. They agreed to present their initial findings at the International AI Conference next March. 2. **Generated Queries ** - Where did Alice and Bob meet? - When did the meeting take place? - What was the main topic discussed during the meeting? - Who suggested incorporating advanced AI methodologies? - Did Alice support Bob’s suggestion about AI methodologies? - When will Alice and Bob present their initial findings? - At which conference will their findings be presented? - What kind of methodologies were discussed? - What is the nature
