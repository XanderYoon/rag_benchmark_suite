and “1” as the generation index. From the use case, it can be seen that QCG-RAG, by directly retrieving generated Query+Answer pairs, can accurately match those produced by the “ 20261219 19:00-0,” and “ 20261228 10:00-0” chunks, as well as the query associated with the chunk “20261221 12:00-0” that contains all correct answers: {"q_id": "20261221_12:00-0-14", "query": "What does Yuriko Yamamoto say about Wolfgang’s trip?", "answer": "Aww, Wolfgang, we’ll miss you! But safe travels!"} Furthermore, through one-hop expansion on the query-centric graph (QCG), it can additionally retrieve another query from the same chunk: {"q_id": "20261221_12:00-0-12", "query": "What does Wolfgang say about catching up after his trip?", "answer": "I’ll be eager to catch up once I’m back and hear all the new stuff!"} This enables the relevance score of “20261221 12:00-0” to be further enhanced in subsequent chunk ranking. 19 Use Case D.2: QCG-RAG on LiHuaWorld { "question": "Who knows about Wolfgang going to Hong Kong?", "answer": "LiHua & Chae & Yuriko", "evidence": ["20261219_19:00", "20261220_20:00", "20261221_12:00", " 20261228_10:00"], "type": "Multi", "results": { "topk_qids": ["20261221_12:00-0-1", "20261219_19:00-0-0", "20261219_19 :00-0-8", "20261219_19:00-0-1", "20261223_23:00-0-0", "20261223_23 :00-0-12", "20261219_19:00-0-15", "20261219_19:00-0-2", "20261223 _23:00-0-1", "20261223_23:00-0-9", "20261228_10:00-0-3", "20260106 _20:00-0-7", "20261228_10:00-0-0", "20261221_12:00-0-14", "20261228 _10:00-0-1"], "extra_qids_via_knn": ["20260428_18:00-0-5", "20260627_12:00-0-0", "20260307_15:00-0-9", "20261221_12:00-0-12"] "chunk_to_queries": {"20260106_20:00-0": ["20260106_20:00-0-7"], "20260428_18:00-0": ["20260428_18:00-0-5"], "20260627_12:00-0": ["20260627_12:00-0-0"], "20261219_19:00-0": ["20261219_19:00-0-2", "20261219_19:00-0-1", "20261219_19:00-0-0", "20261219_19:00-0-15", "20261219_19:00-0-8"], "20261228_10:00-0": ["20261228_10:00-0-1", " 20261228_10:00-0-3", "20261228_10:00-0-0"], "20260307_15:00-0": ["20260307_15:00-0-9"], "20261221_12:00-0": ["20261221_12:00-0-1", "20261221_12:00-0-14", "20261221_12:00-0-12"], "20261223_23:00-0": ["20261223_23:00-0-0", "20261223_23:00-0-12", "20261223_23:00-0-1", "20261223_23:00-0-9"]}, "sorted_chunk_ids": ["20261219_19:00-0", "20261223_23:00-0", "20261221 _12:00-0", "20260106_20:00-0", "20261228_10:00-0", "20260307_15 :00-0", "20260627_12:00-0", "20260428_18:00-0"], "topk_chunk_ids": ["20261219_19:00-0", "20261223_23:00-0", "20261221 _12:00-0", "20260106_20:00-0", "20261228_10:00-0"], "response": "Wolfgang’s trip to Hong Kong was known by several people, as evidenced by the conversations in the provided chats: ### Colleagues and Friends - **Li Hua **: Li Hua was one of the first to know about Wolfgang’s trip.
