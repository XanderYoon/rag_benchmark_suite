GraphRAG is implemented using MsGraphRAG-Neo4j4, enabling retrieval over chunks, entities, relations, and summaries. •LightRAG(Guo et al., 2024): A graph-based method that builds entity–relation indexes and employs a dual-level retrieval framework for fine-grained entity access and coarse-grained topic retrieval. •MiniRAG(Fan et al., 2025): A lightweight heterogeneous graph framework that unifies text chunks and entities into a single index and employs heuristic retrieval for efficient knowledge discovery. •KG-Retriever(Chen et al., 2024): A hierarchical index graph (HIG) framework combining an entity-level knowledge graph with a document-level layer to enhance both intra-document and cross-document connectivity. Setup Details.Following prior work (Fan et al., 2025), we segment documents into chunks of 1200 tokens with an overlap of 100 tokens, and additionally use a 512-token with 64-token overlap setting for comparison. For embeddings, we employ Sentence-BERT (Reimers & Gurevych, 2019), using all-MiniLM-L6-v2 as the default model and all-mpnet-base-v2 for comparison; cosine similarity is used for retrieval without reranking. We retrieve the top-K chunks (K= 5 ) and cap the input length at 6000 tokens. For QCG-RAG, we set dataset-specific hyperparameters: forLiHuaWorld, M= 20 , α= 80% , h= 1 , k= 2 , n= 10 , and γ= 1.5 ; forMultiHop-RAG, M= 20 , α= 80% , h= 1 , k= 3 , n= 15, andγ= 1.0. Details of the implementation can be found in Appendix B. We adopt Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct (Team, 2024) for query generation to build query- centric graphs, and use Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct for comparison. We also employ Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct for question answering and response evaluation within theLLM-as-a- Judgeframework. The LLM prompts are provided in Appendix C.
