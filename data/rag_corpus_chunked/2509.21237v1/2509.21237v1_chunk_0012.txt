and the reference answer, and outputs a categorical correctness decision (correct/incorrect). To ensure reproducibility, we adopt a fixed prompt and deterministic decoding. Baselines.We compare QCG-RAG with representative RAG and graph-based RAG methods: •Naive RAG(Lewis et al., 2020): A standard baseline that retrieves relevant documents via a dense retriever and conditions an LLM generator on the retrieved content. •D2QRAG & D2Q--RAG: Extensions of Naive RAG that incorporate Doc2Query (Nogueira et al., 2019) or Doc2Query-- (Gospodinov et al., 2023) for document expansion. Doc2Query appends generated queries to documents, while Doc2Query-- further filters irrelevant or hallucinated queries. 6 Method Graph Context LiHuaWorld MultiHop-RAG C E R S Overall Multi Single Null OverallInferenceComparisonTemporal Null Naive RAG - ✓ ✗ ✗ ✗ 65.78%43.94%66.80%80.00%75.80% 93.46% 66.85% 68.00% 71.21% D2QRAG - ✓ ✗ ✗ ✗ 63.74%39.39%65.22%76.92%76.20% 92.81% 69.61% 66.00% 71.21% D2Q--RAG - ✓ ✗ ✗ ✗ 64.99%40.91%66.60%76.92%76.80% 92.16% 67.96% 70.00% 75.76% GraphRAG KG ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ 42.70%28.79%39.72%80.00%67.20% 81.05% 64.09% 66.00% 45.45% LightRAG KG ✗ ✓ ✓ ✗ 66.41%57.58%69.76%49.23%72.20% 94.12% 71.82% 59.00% 42.42% MiniRAG KG ✓ ✓ ✗ ✗ 60.28%62.12%58.89%69.23%60.40% 75.16% 54.70% 54.00% 51.52% KG-RetrieverHIG ✗ ✗ ✓ ✗ 31.24%18.18%27.67%72.31%47.60% 79.08% 19.89% 33.00% 72.73% QCG-RAG QCG ✓ ✗ ✗ ✗ 73.16%62.12%74.51%73.85%79.60% 93.46% 74.59% 69.00% 77.27% Table 1: Performance comparison on LiHuaWorld and MultiHop-RAG using Accuracy (%). Context indicates whether the method incorporates chunks (C), entities (E), relations (R), or summaries (S). Graph includes Knowledge Graph (KG), Hierarchical Index Graph (HIG), and Query-Centric Graph (QCG). Thebestresults are highlighted inbold, and the second-best results are underlined. •GraphRAG(Edge et al., 2024a): A graph-based approach that constructs entity-centric knowledge graphs and community-level summaries, and applies a map-reduce strategy over communities to aggregate answers. GraphRAG is implemented using MsGraphRAG-Neo4j4, enabling retrieval over chunks, entities, relations, and summaries. •LightRAG(Guo et al., 2024): A graph-based method that builds entity–relation indexes and employs a dual-level
