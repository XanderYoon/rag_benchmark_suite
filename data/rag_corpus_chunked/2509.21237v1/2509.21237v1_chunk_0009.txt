=sim(q j g,i ⊕a j g,i, ci), where sim(·,·) denotes the semantic similarity function (e.g., cosine similarity). ⊕ denotes text-level concatenation. The queries are ranked bys j i , and only the topαpercentile are retained: Qα g,i =Top-α  (qj g,i, aj g,i)|s j i , α∈(0,1]. This mechanism maintains the fidelity of synthetic query-answer pairs to the source content ci, which in turn contributes to more precise and reliable retrieval. Step 3: Indexing Graph Construction.We construct a two-layer indexing graph G= (V, E) consisting of a query-level layer and a chunk-level layer: V=C ∪ Q g, whereQ g = N[ i=1 Qα g,i. EdgesEcapture two types of relations: Eintra ={(q, q ′)|q ′ ∈KNN(q, k), q∈ Q g}, Einter ={(q, c i)|q∈ Q α g,i, ci ∈ C}, where Eintra encodes semantic similarity between queries, and Einter links queries to their source chunks. For simplicity, let q denote (q, a) and q′ denote (q′, a′). In practice, q corresponds to the combined query–answer pair q⊕a before being embedded into a vector space. Unless otherwise stated, we adopt this simplified notation throughout the following discussion. KNN(q, k) denotes the set of the k most similar queries q′ to q based on the similarity function. The resultingQuery- Centric Graphprovides a high-quality, semantically rich, and granularity-controllable structure for downstream retrieval. 3.4 QUERY-CENTRICGRAPHRETRIEVAL& GENERATIONMECHANISM This component performs retrieval and response generation over the constructed Query-Centric Graph. It consists of four sequential steps: (1) retrieving relevant queries, (2) expanding to neighboring queries, (3) collecting and ranking associated chunks, and (4) generating responses. Step 1: Retrieving Relevant Queries.Given a user query qu, we first compute its similarity with graph queriesQ g =SN i=1 Qα g,i. The similarity is defined as: s(qu, q) =sim(q u, q) +ϵ,∀q∈ Q g, where sim(·,·) denotes cosine similarity, and ϵ=
