from the graph (Query → Retrieved Queries); (2) expanding to neighboring queries to capture multi-hop relations (Retrieved Queries → Neighboring 4 Queries); (3) aggregating and ranking associated chunks linked to the retrieved query set (Query Set → Chunk Set); and (4) generating the final response by conditioning the LLM on the user query and the top-K retrieved chunks (Top-K Chunk Set → Generation). This query-centric retrieval design enables flexible granularity control, better coverage of relevant document segments, and interpretable reasoning paths. 3.3 QUERY-CENTRICGRAPHCONSTRUCTION This component builds a controllable-granularityQuery-Centric Graphby leveraging and extending Doc2Query and Doc2Query--. It consists of three sequential steps: (1) query generation, (2) query quality and quantity control, and (3) indexing graph construction. Step 1: Query Generation.Given a corpus of chunks C={c 1, c2, . . . , cN }, each chunk ci is expanded into multiple synthetic query–answer pairs via extended Doc2Query: Qg,i ={(q 1 g,i, a1 g,i),(q 2 g,i, a2 g,i), . . . ,(q M g,i, aM g,i)}, where qj g,i(j∈[1, M]) is a generated query grounded in ci and aj g,i is its corresponding answer. Query–answer pairs enrich semantic signals by anchoring queries with contextualized answers, reduc- ing ambiguity, strengthening chunk alignment, and expanding retrieval through multiple grounded entry points for each chunk. Step 2: Query Quality and Quantity Control.For each generated query-answer pair (qj g,i, aj g,i), we compute its semantic similarity with the source chunkc i according to extended Doc2Query--: sj i =sim(q j g,i ⊕a j g,i, ci), where sim(·,·) denotes the semantic similarity function (e.g., cosine similarity). ⊕ denotes text-level concatenation. The queries are ranked bys j i , and only the topαpercentile are retained: Qα g,i =Top-α  (qj g,i, aj g,i)|s j i , α∈(0,1]. This mechanism maintains the fidelity of synthetic query-answer pairs to the source content
