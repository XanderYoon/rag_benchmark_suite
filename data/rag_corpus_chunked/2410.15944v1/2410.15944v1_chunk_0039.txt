build a powerful RAG system. 4.2.2 Using Open-Source LLM Model: Llama We will utilize Ollama, an open-source framework that implements the Llama model, to incorporate Llama-based question generation capabilities within our application. By em- ploying Ollama, we can process user input and generate contextually relevant questions directly through the terminal, offering an efficient and scalable solution for natural language processing tasks in a local environment. This integration will enable seamless question generation without relying on external API ser- vices, ensuring both privacy and computational efficiency. 1.

Converting PDFs to Text Files Save this script as pdf to text.py. This script converts PDF files in a given folder into text files. You have to create one folder at the same directory. The folder name should be Data. You have to keep your PDF files in this Data folder for the further process. Check the GitHub Link of the Code. Code Example: import os import fitz # PyMuPDF for reading PDFs def c o n v e r t _ p d f s _ t o _ t e x t ( pdf_folder , t e x t _ f o l d e r ) : if not os . path . exists ( t e x t _ f o l d e r ) : os . makedirs ( t e x t _ f o l d e r ) for fi le
