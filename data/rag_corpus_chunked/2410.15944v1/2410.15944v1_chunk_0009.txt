most RAG models. Handling these elements requires specialized tools and preprocessing to ensure the extracted data is coherent and useful for RAG tasks. 2.3.2 Key Considerations for PDF Processing in RAG Application Development Processing PDFs for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications requires careful handling to ensure high-quality text extraction, effective retrieval, and accurate generation. Below are key considerations specif- ically tailored for PDF processing in RAG development. 1. Accurate Text Extraction: Since PDFs can have complex formatting, it is essential to use reliable tools and methods to convert the PDF content into usable text for further processing. – Appropriate Tool for Extraction: There are tools and libraries for ex- tracting text from PDFs for most popular programming languages (i.e: pdfplumber or PyMuPDF (fitz) for Python). These libraries handle most common PDF structures and formats, preserving the text’s layout and struc- ture as much as possible. – Verify and Clean Extracted Text: After extracting text, always verify it for completeness and correctness. This step is essential for catching any extraction errors or artifacts from formatting. 7 2. Effective Chunking for Retrieval: PDF documents often contain large blocks of text, which can be challenging for retrieval models to handle effectively. Chunking the text into smaller, contextu- ally coherent pieces can improve retrieval performance. – Semantic Chunking: Instead of splitting text arbitrarily, use semantic chunking based on logical divisions within the text, such as paragraphs or sections. This ensures that each chunk retains its context, which is important for both retrieval accuracy and relevance. – Dynamic Chunk Sizing: Adjust the chunk size according to the content type and the model’s input limitations. For example, scientific documents might be chunked by sections, while other types of documents could use paragraphs as the primary chunking unit. 3. Preprocessing and Cleaning: Preprocessing the extracted text is
