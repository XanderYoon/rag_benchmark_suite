its context, which is important for both retrieval accuracy and relevance. – Dynamic Chunk Sizing: Adjust the chunk size according to the content type and the model’s input limitations. For example, scientific documents might be chunked by sections, while other types of documents could use paragraphs as the primary chunking unit. 3. Preprocessing and Cleaning: Preprocessing the extracted text is key for removing noise that could affect the performance of both retrieval and generative models. Proper cleaning ensures the text is consistent, relevant, and ready for further processing. – Remove Irrelevant Content: Use regular expressions or NLP-based rules to clean up non-relevant content like headers, footers, page numbers, and any repeating text that doesn’t contribute to the document’s meaning. – Normalize Text: Standardize the text format by converting it to lower- case, removing special characters, and trimming excessive whitespace. This normalization helps create consistent input for the retrieval models. 4. Utilizing PDF Metadata and Annotations: PDFs often contain metadata (such as the author, title, and creation date) and annotations that provide additional context, which can be valuable for retrieval tasks in RAG applications. – Extract Metadata: You can use tools specific to programming languages like PyMuPDF or pdfminer.six for Python to extract embedded metadata. This metadata can be used as features in retrieval models, adding an extra layer of context for more precise search results. – Utilize Annotations: Extract and analyze annotations or comments within PDFs to understand important or highlighted sections. This can help prior- itize content in the retrieval process. 5. Error Handling and Reliability: Reliability in processing PDFs is essential for maintaining the stability and re- liability of RAG applications. Implementing proper error handling and logging helps manage unexpected issues and ensures smooth operation. – Implement Error Handling: Use try-except blocks to manage potential errors during PDF
