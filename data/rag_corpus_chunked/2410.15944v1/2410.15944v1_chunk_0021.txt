Understanding the Problem Domain and Data Requirements To develop an effective solution for managing and retrieving information, it’s important to understand the problem domain and identify the specific data requirements and not just provide any data . For a deeper insight into the challenges of handling PDFs, refer to Section[2.3.1]. Given that this paper focuses on working with PDFs, it is important to emphasize the significance of having relevant and clean data within these documents. Organize the Knowledge Base Files: After selecting the PDF(s) for your external knowledge base, create a folder named Upload in the project directory, and place all the selected PDFs inside this folder. Common Mistakes and Best Practices Mistake: Irrelevant or inconsistent data Poor-structured data in PDFs downgrades the quality of embeddings generated for Large Language Models (LLMs), hindering them to understand and process the content more accurately. Best Practice: Ensure data consistency and relevance All
