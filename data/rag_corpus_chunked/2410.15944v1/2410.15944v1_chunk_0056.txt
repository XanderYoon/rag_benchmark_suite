Conclusions The development of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems offers a new way to improve large language models by grounding their outputs in real- time, relevant information. This paper covers the main steps for building RAG systems that use PDF documents as the data source. With clear examples and code snippets, it connects theory with practice and highlights challenges like handling complex PDFs and extracting useful text. It also looks at the options available, with examples of using proprietary APIs like OpenAI’s GPT and, as an alternative, open-source models like Llama 3.1, helping developers choose the best tools for their needs. By following the recommendations in this guide, developers can avoid com- mon mistakes and ensure their RAG systems retrieve relevant information and generate accurate, fact-based responses. As technology advances in adaptive learning, multi-modal capabilities, and retrieval methods, RAG systems will play a key role in industries like healthcare, legal research, and technical documen- tation. This guide offers a solid foundation for optimizing RAG systems and extending the potential of generative AI in practical applications. 34 References 1.
