world use. 6 Discussion Practitioners in fields like healthcare, legal analysis, and customer support, often struggle with static models that rely on outdated or limited knowledge. RAG models provide practical solutions with pulling in real time data from provided sources. The ability to explain and trace how RAG models reach their answers also builds trust where accountability and decision making based on real evidence is important. In this paper, we developed a RAG guide that we tested in a workshop setting, where participants set up and deployed RAG systems following the approaches mentioned. This contribution is practical, as it helps practitioners implement RAG models to address real world challenges with dynamic data and improved accuracy. The guide provides users clear, actionable steps to integrate RAG into their workflows, contributing to the growing toolkit of AI driven solutions. With that, RAG also opens new research avenues that can shape the future of AI and NLP technologies. As these models and tools improve, there are many potential areas for growth, such as finding better ways to search for information, adapting to new data automatically, and handling more than just text (like images or audio). Recent advancements in tools and technologies have further accelerated the development and deployment of RAG models. As RAG models continue to evolve, several emerging trends are shaping the future of this field. 1. Haystack: An open-source framework that integrates dense and sparse re- trieval methods with large-scale language models. Haystack supports real- time search applications and can be used to develop RAG models that per- form tasks such as document retrieval, question answering, and summariza- tion [4]. 2. Elasticsearch with Vector Search : Enhanced support for dense vector search capabilities, allowing RAG models to perform more sophisticated re- trieval tasks. Elasticsearch’s integration with frameworks like Faiss enables 33
