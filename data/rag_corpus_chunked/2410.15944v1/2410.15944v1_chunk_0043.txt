Here, sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 is a compact, fast trans- former model that generates sentence embeddings for tasks like semantic search and text similarity. It’s efficient and ideal for quick, accurate text retrieval in applications like FAISS indexing. 4. Setting Up OLlama and Llama 3.1 Before implementing the last script that handles user queries and generates responses using a Large Language Model (LLM), we need to select an open- source LLM. By using OLlama as the model runner, we can
