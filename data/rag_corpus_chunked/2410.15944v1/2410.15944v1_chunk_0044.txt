search and text similarity. It’s efficient and ideal for quick, accurate text retrieval in applications like FAISS indexing. 4. Setting Up OLlama and Llama 3.1 Before implementing the last script that handles user queries and generates responses using a Large Language Model (LLM), we need to select an open- source LLM. By using OLlama as the model runner, we can easily integrate Llama 3.1 into our system. (a) Step 1: Download OLlama To get started with OLlama, follow these steps: i. Visit the official OLlama website. ii. Choose the version suitable for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). iii. Download and install the appropriate installer from the website. (b) Step 2: Install Llama 3.1 Using OLlama After installing OLlama, you can download and install Llama 3.1 by running the following command in your PowerShell or CMD terminal: oLlama pull Llama3 .1 (c) Step 3: Running Llama 3.1 Once the Llama 3.1 model is installed, you can start using it by running a command similar to this: oLlama run Llama3 .1 This command runs the Llama 3.1 model, allowing you to ask questions directly in the terminal and interact with the model in real time. 26 (d) Step 4: Test OLlama in VS Code create a .bat file to avoid typing the full path each time. Open Notepad, add this: @echo off " C :\ path \ to \ OLlama \ oLlama . exe " %* Replace the path with your own. Save the file as oLlama.bat directly in your project folder. In the VS Code terminal, run the .bat file with the command: .\ oLlama . bat run Llama3 .1 5. Implementing RAG-Based Question Generation Save this script as main.py. This script retrieves relevant documents using FAISS and generates questions based on the retrieved context using OLlama and Llama
