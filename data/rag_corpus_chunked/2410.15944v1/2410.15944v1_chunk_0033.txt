Best Practice: Classifying Queries into Categories For tasks in which lots of independent sets of instructions are needed to handle different cases, it can be beneficial to first classify the type of query and to use that classification to determine which instructions are needed. 5. Creating Conversation Thread Creating a thread, initializes a context-aware conversation session where the AI assistant can interact with the user, retrieve relevant information from the vector store, and generate responses based on that context. Additionally, tool resources can be attached to the Assistant API threads that are made available to the assistant’s tools in this thread. This capability is essentially important when there is a need to use the same AI assistant with different tools for different threads. They can be dynami- cally managed to suit the requirements for topic-specific threads, reusing the same Assistant across different contexts or overwriting assistant tools for a specific thread. Code Example: Initialize a thread for conversation # Create thread t h r e a d _ c o n v e r s a t i o n = { " t o o l _ r e s o u r c e s " : { " f i l e _ s e a r c h " : { " v e c t o r _ s t o r e _ i d s " : [ v e c t o r _ s t o r e . id ] 21 } } } m e s s a g e _ t h r e a d = client . beta . threads . create (** t h r e a d _ c o n v e r s a t i o n ) 6.
