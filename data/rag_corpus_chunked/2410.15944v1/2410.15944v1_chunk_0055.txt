models. Haystack supports real- time search applications and can be used to develop RAG models that per- form tasks such as document retrieval, question answering, and summariza- tion [4]. 2. Elasticsearch with Vector Search : Enhanced support for dense vector search capabilities, allowing RAG models to perform more sophisticated re- trieval tasks. Elasticsearch’s integration with frameworks like Faiss enables 33 hybrid retrieval systems that combine the strengths of both dense and sparse search methods, optimizing retrieval speed and accuracy for large datasets[3]. 3. Integration with Knowledge Graphs: Researchers are exploring ways to integrate RAG models with structured knowledge bases such as knowledge graphs. This integration aims to improve the factual accuracy and reasoning capabilities of the models, making them more reliable for knowledge-intensive tasks[8]. 4. Adaptive Learning and Continual Fine-Tuning : There is a growing interest in adaptive learning techniques that allow RAG models to contin- uously fine-tune themselves based on new data and user feedback. This ap- proach aims to keep models up-to-date and relevant in rapidly changing information environments[7]. 5. Cross-Lingual and Multimodal Capabilities : Future RAG models are expected to expand their capabilities across different languages and modal- ities. Incorporating cross-lingual retrieval and multimodal data processing can make RAG models more versatile and applicable to a wider range of global and multimedia tasks[2]. Future research will likely focus on enhancing their adaptability, cross-lingual capabilities, and integration with diverse data sources to address increasingly complex information needs. 7 Conclusions The development of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems offers a new way to improve large language models by grounding their outputs in real- time, relevant information. This paper covers the main steps for building RAG systems that use PDF documents as the data source. With clear examples and code snippets, it connects theory with practice and highlights challenges like
