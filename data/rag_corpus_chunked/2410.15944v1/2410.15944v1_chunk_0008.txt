for generating precise responses. PDFs also include metadata (like author, keywords, and creation date) and annotations (such as 6 highlights and comments) that provide extra context, helping RAG models pri- oritize sections and better understand document structure, ultimately enhancing retrieval and generation accuracy. 2.3.1 Challenges of Working with PDFs In RAG applications, accurate text extraction from PDFs is essential for effective retrieval and generation. How- ever, PDFs often feature complex layouts—such as multiple columns, headers, footers, and embedded images—that complicate the extraction process. These complexities challenge RAG systems, which rely on clean, structured text for high-quality retrieval. Text extraction accuracy from PDFs decreases dramati- cally in documents with intricate layouts, such as multi-column formats or those with numerous figures and tables. This decline necessitates advanced extraction techniques and machine learning models tailored to diverse document structures. Moreover, the lack of standardization in PDF creation, including different en- coding methods and embedded fonts, can result in inconsistent or garbled text, further complicating extraction and degrading RAG model performance. Addi- tionally, many PDFs are scanned documents, especially in fields like law and academia, requiring Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to convert images to text. OCR can introduce errors, particularly with low-quality scans or hand- written text, leading to inaccuracies that are problematic in RAG applications, where precise input is essential for generating relevant responses. PDFs may also contain non-textual elements like charts, tables, and images, disrupting the lin- ear text flow required by most RAG models. Handling these elements requires specialized tools and preprocessing to ensure the extracted data is coherent and useful for RAG tasks. 2.3.2 Key Considerations for PDF Processing in RAG Application Development Processing PDFs for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications requires careful handling to ensure high-quality text extraction, effective retrieval, and accurate generation.
