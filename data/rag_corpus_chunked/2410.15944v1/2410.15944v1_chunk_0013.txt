for improvements in text extraction and chunking to ensure coherent retrieval. 9 The design also incorporates the feedback from a diverse group of partici- pants during a workshop session, which focused on the practical aspects of imple- menting RAG systems. Their input highlighted the effectiveness of the system’s real-time retrieval capabilities, particularly in knowledge-intensive domains, and underscored the importance of refining the integration between retrieval and generation to enhance the transparency and reliability of the system’s outputs. This design sets the foundation for a RAG system capable of addressing the needs of domains requiring precise, up-to-date information. 4 Results: Step-by-Step Guide to RAG 4.1 Setting Up the Environment This section walks you through the steps required to set up a development environment for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) on your local machine. We will cover the installation of Python, setting up a virtual environment and configuring an IDE (VSCode). 4.1.1 Installing Python If Python is not already installed on your machine, follow the steps below: 1. Download and Install Python – Navigate to the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/ – Download the latest version of Python for your operating system (Win- dows, macOS, or Linux). – During installation, ensure that you select the option Add Python to PATH. This is important to run Python from the terminal or command line. – For Windows users, you can also: • Click on Customize Installation . • Select Add Python to environment variables . • Click Install Now . 2. Verify the Installation – Open the terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on ma- cOS/Linux). – Run the following command to verify that Python is installed correctly: python --version – If Python is installed correctly, you should see output similar to Python 3.x.x. 4.1.2 Setting Up an IDE After installing Python, the next step is
