responses are grounded in real-time data and minimizing hallucinations. It also provides transparency, as the source of the retrieved in- formation can be linked directly. Drawbacks: RAG requires complex infrastructure, including vector databases and effective retrieval pipelines, and can be resource-intensive during inference. Use Case Examples: – Financial Advisor Chatbot : Using RAG, a chatbot can pull the latest market trends and customer-specific portfolio data to offer personalized in- vestment advice. – Legal Document Analysis : RAG can retrieve relevant case laws and statutes from a constantly updated database, making it suitable for legal applications where accuracy and up-to-date information are critical. 2.2.3 When to Use Base Models Using base models(without fine-tuning or RAG) is appropriate when the task requires broad generalization, low-cost deployment, or rapid prototyping. Base models can handle simple use cases like generic customer support or basic question answering, where specialized or dy- namic information is not required. 5 Advantages: No additional training is required, making it easy to deploy and maintain. It is best for general purpose tasks or when exploring potential applications without high upfront costs. Drawbacks: Limited performance on domain specific queries or tasks that need high levels of customization.
