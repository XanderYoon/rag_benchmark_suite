By incorporating real-time retrieval from domain-specific PDFs, the system aims to deliver responses that are not only contextually appropriate but also up-to-date and factually reliable. The system begins with the collection of relevant PDFs, including research papers, legal documents, and technical manuals, forming a specialized knowledge base. Using tools and libraries, the text is extracted, cleaned, and preprocessed to remove irrelevant elements such as headers and footers. The cleaned text is then segmented into manageable chunks, ensuring efficient retrieval. These text segments are converted into vector embeddings using transformer-based models like BERT or Sentence Transformers, which capture the semantic meaning of the text. The embeddings are stored in a vector database optimized for fast similarity-based retrieval. The RAG system architecture consists of two key components: a retriever, which converts user queries into vector embeddings to search the vector database, and a generator, which synthesizes the retrieved content into a coherent, factual response. Two types of models are considered: OpenAI’s GPT models, accessed through the Assistant API for ease of integration, and the open-source Llama model, which offers greater customization for domain-specific tasks. In developing the system, several challenges are addressed, such as managing complex PDF layouts (e.g., multi-column formats, embedded images) and main- taining retrieval efficiency as the knowledge base grows. These challenges were highlighted during a preliminary evaluation process, where participants pointed out the difficulty of handling documents with irregular structures. Feedback from the evaluation also emphasized the need for improvements in text extraction and chunking to ensure coherent retrieval. 9 The design also incorporates the feedback from a diverse group of partici- pants during a workshop session, which focused on the practical aspects of imple- menting RAG systems. Their input highlighted the effectiveness of the system’s real-time retrieval capabilities, particularly in knowledge-intensive domains, and underscored the importance of
