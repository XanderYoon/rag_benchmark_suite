by combining text generation with file searches, code execution, and API calls. For a RAG system, this means an assistant can retrieve documents, generate vector embeddings, search for relevant content, augment user queries with addi- tional context, and generate responses—all in a seamless, integrated workflow. It includes memory management across sessions, so the assistant remembers past queries, retrieved documents, or instructions. Assistants can be configured with specialized instructions, behaviors, parameters other than custom tools that makes this API far more powerful for developing RAG systems. This subsection provides a step-by-step guide and code snippets to utilize the OpenAI’s File Search tool within the Assistant API, as illustrated in 13 Fig. 2: Open AI’s Assistant API Workflow Fig[2] to implement RAG. The diagram shows how after the domain specific data ingestion of supported files (such as PDFs, DOCX, JSON, etc.), the data prepocessing[2] and vectorization[3] is handled by Assistant API. These vectors are stored in OpenAI Vector Store, which the File Search tool can query to retrieve relevant content. The assistant then augments the context and generates accurate responses based on specialized instructions and the retrieved informa- tion. This integrated process is covered in detailed steps below: 1. Environment Setup and API Configuration Setting up your environment and configuring access to OpenAI’s API is the foundational step. (a) Create an OpenAI Account. (b) Once logged in, navigate to the OpenAI API dashboard. Generate a New Project API Key. (c) Depending on your usage and plan, OpenAI may require you to set up billing information. Navigate to the Billing section in the dashboard to add your payment details. Refer to Appendix[7] for cost estimations. Store your API key securely. A .env file is used to securely store environ- ment variables, such as your OpenAI API key. (a) Set Up a New Project
