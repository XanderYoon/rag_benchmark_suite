the terminal, use the mkdir command to create a new folder for your project. For example, to create a folder named my-new-project, type: mkdir my-new-project – Use the cd command to change directories and navigate to the folder where your project is located. For example: cd path/to/your/project/folder/my-new-project 2. Create a Virtual Environment – For Windows, run the following commands: python -m venv my_rag_env my_rag_env\Scripts\activate – For Mac/Linux, run the following commands: python3 -m venv my_rag_env source my_rag_env/bin/activate 3. Configure VSCode to Use the Virtual Environment – Open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl + Shift + P (or Cmd + Shift + P on Mac). – Type Python: Select Interpreter in the Command Palette. – Select your virtual environment, my rag env, from the list. 11 With your virtual environment now configured, you are ready to install project specific dependencies and manage Python packages independently for each approach. This setup allows you to create separate virtual environments for the two approaches outlined in Sections[4.2.1][4.2.2]. By isolating your de- pendencies, you can ensure that the OpenAI Assistant API-based[4.2.1] and Llama-based [4.2.2] Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are de- veloped and managed in their respective environments without conflicts or de- pendency issues. This practice also helps maintain cleaner, more manageable development workflows for both models, ensuring that each approach functions optimally with its specific requirements. 4.2 Two Approaches to RAG: Proprietary and Open source This section introduces a structured guide for developing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, focusing on two distinct approaches:using OpenAI’s Assistant API (GPT Series) and an open-source Large Language Model (LLM) Llama and thus divided into two subsections[4.2.1][4.2.2]. The objective is to equip developers with the knowledge and practical steps necessary to implement RAG systems effectively, while highlighting common mistakes and best practices at each stage of the process.
