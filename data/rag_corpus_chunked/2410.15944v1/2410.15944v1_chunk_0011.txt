highlighted sections. This can help prior- itize content in the retrieval process. 5. Error Handling and Reliability: Reliability in processing PDFs is essential for maintaining the stability and re- liability of RAG applications. Implementing proper error handling and logging helps manage unexpected issues and ensures smooth operation. – Implement Error Handling: Use try-except blocks to manage potential errors during PDF processing. This ensures the application continues run- ning smoothly and logs any issues for later analysis. 8 – Use Logging for Monitoring: Implement logging to capture detailed in- formation about the PDF processing steps, including successes, failures, and any anomalies. This is important for debugging and optimizing the applica- tion over time. By following these key considerations and best practices, we can effectively process PDFs for RAG applications, ensuring high-quality text extraction, re- trieval, and generation. This approach ensures that your RAG models are strong, efficient, and capable of delivering meaningful insights from complex PDF doc- uments. 3 Study Design This section presents the methodology for building a Retrieval Augmented Gen- eration (RAG) system that integrates PDF documents as a primary knowledge source. This system combines the retrieval capabilities of information retrieval (IR) techniques with the generative strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce factually accurate and contextually relevant responses, grounded in domain-specific documents. The goal is to design and implement a RAG system that addresses the limita- tions of traditional LLMs, which rely solely on static, pre-trained knowledge. By incorporating real-time retrieval from domain-specific PDFs, the system aims to deliver responses that are not only contextually appropriate but also up-to-date and factually reliable. The system begins with the collection of relevant PDFs, including research papers, legal documents, and technical manuals, forming a specialized knowledge base. Using tools and libraries, the text is extracted, cleaned, and preprocessed to remove
