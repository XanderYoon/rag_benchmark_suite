PDF file(s) and creating a vector store are defined you can call it to create Knowledge Base for your project by pro- viding vector store nameand store in avector store object as shown below: Code Example: Creating Vector Store Object v e c t o r _ s t o r e _ n a m e = " " # Ensure this is set to a valid name v e c t o r _ s t o r e = g e t _ o r _ c r e a t e _ v e c t o r _ s t o r e ( client , v e c t o r _ s t o r e _ n a m e ) 4. Creating Assistant with Specialized Instructions After setting up the vector store, the next step is to create an AI assistant using the OpenAI API. This assistant will be configured with specialized instructions and tools to perform RAG tasks effectively. Set the assistant name, description and instructions properties accordingly. Refer to the 19 best practices, if needed you can also play with the temperature and top p values as per the project needs for random or deterministic responses. Code Example: Create and Configure Assistant # Get / Create As si st an t def g e t _ o r _ c r e a t e _ a s s i s t a n t ( client , model_name , v e c t o r _ s t o r e _ i d ) : a s s i s t a n t _ n a m e = " " # Ensure this is set to a valid name d e s c r i
