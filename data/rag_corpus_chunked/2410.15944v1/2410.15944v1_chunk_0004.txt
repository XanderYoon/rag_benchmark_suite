prompt, consisting of the original user query combined with the retrieved relevant content is provided to a Large Language Model (LLM) like GPT, T5 or Llama. The LLM then processes this augmented in- put to generate a coherent response not only fluent but factually grounded. 7. Final Output: By moving beyond the opaque outputs of traditional models, the final output of RAG systems offer several advantages: they minimize the risk of generating hallucinations or outdated information, enhance interpretability by clearly linking outputs to real-world sources, enriched with relevant and accurate responses. The RAG model framework introduces a paradigm shift in Generative AI by creating glass-box models. It greatly enhanced the ability of generative models to provide accurate information, especially in knowledge-intensive domains. This integration has become the backbone of many advanced NLP applications, such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and automated customer service systems.[5] 2.2 When to Use RAG: Considerations for Practitioners Choosing between fine-tuning, using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), or base models can be a challenging decision for practitioners. Each approach offers distinct advantages depending on the context and constraints of the use case. This section aims to outline the scenarios in which each method is most effective, providing a decision framework to guide practitioners in selecting the appropriate strategy. 2.2.1 Fine-Tuning: Domain Expertise and Customization Fine-tuning involves training an existing large language model (LLM) on a smaller, special- ized dataset to refine its knowledge for a particular domain or task. This method excels in scenarios where accuracy, tone consistency, and deep understanding of niche contexts are essential. For instance, fine-tuning has been shown to improve a model’s performance in specialized content generation, such as technical writ- ing, customer support, and internal knowledge systems. Advantages: Fine-tuning embeds domain specific knowledge directly into the model, reducing the dependency on external data
