broad appli- cability Data Require- ments Static or proprietary data that rarely changes Access to up-to-date or external large knowledge bases Does not require specialized or up-to- date information Resource Con- straints High computational resources needed for training Higher inference cost and infrastructure complexity Low resource de- mand, quick to deploy Performance Goals Maximizing pre- cision and adapt- ability to specific language Providing accu- rate, context-aware responses from dy- namic sources Optimizing speed and cost efficiency over precision To conclude, the decision framework outlined in Table[1] offers practitioners a guide to selecting the most suitable method based on their project’s specific needs. Fine-Tuning is the best option for specialized, high-precision tasks with stable data; RAG should be used when access to dynamic, large-scale data is necessary; and Base Models are well-suited for general-purpose use with low resource requirements. 2.3 Understanding the Role of PDFs in RAG PDFs are paramount for RAG applications because they are widely used for distributing high-value content like research papers, legal documents, technical manuals, and financial reports, all of which contain dense, detailed information essential for training RAG models. PDFs come in various forms, allowing access to a wide range of data types—from scientific data and technical diagrams to le- gal terms and financial figures. This diversity makes PDFs an invaluable resource for extracting rich, contextually relevant information. Additionally, the consis- tent formatting of PDFs ensures accurate text extraction and context preserva- tion, which is fundamental for generating precise responses. PDFs also include metadata (like author, keywords, and creation date) and annotations (such as 6 highlights and comments) that provide extra context, helping RAG models pri- oritize sections and better understand document structure, ultimately enhancing retrieval and generation accuracy. 2.3.1 Challenges of Working with PDFs In RAG applications, accurate text extraction from PDFs is essential for
