Best Practice: Augment Queries with Contextual Informa- tion Incorporate additional contextual information when form- ing queries to improve retrieval quality. Using techniques like rel- evance feedback or pseudo-relevance feedback can help refine search results.[[6]][[1]] Best Practice: Handle Naming Conflicts Gracefully When creating vector stores, consider adding a timestamp or unique iden- tifier to the vector store name to avoid naming conflicts and make it easier to manage multiple vector stores. Best Practice: Chunking strategy By default OpenAI uses a max chunk size tokens of 800 and chunk overlap tokens of 400 to chunk the file(s) for Vector Stores. Properly sized chunks ensure that each chunk contains a coherent and contextually meaningful piece of information. If chunks are too large, they may contain unrelated content, conversely, if chunks are too small, they may lack sufficient context to be useful. Configure the variables accordingly the PDF(s). Once the functions to upload PDF file(s) and creating a vector store are defined you can call it to create Knowledge Base for your project by pro- viding vector store nameand store in avector store object as shown below: Code Example: Creating Vector Store Object v e c t o r _ s t o r e _ n a m e = " "
