solution would allo w for natural language queries without requiring users to have expertise in complex querying languages like SQL. Ad ditionally, the information retrieved should be easy to understand or even summarized for the user’s convenience. A signiﬁcant challenge lies in the evolution of knowledge ma nagement systems alongside the organization itself. This evolution often results in inconsistencies in data formats , with information being both structured and unstructured. Organizations typically have a wide variety of document for mats, such as .doc, .docx, .pdf, .csv, .xls, .txt, and HTML, among others. Furthermore, this information is often scatt ered across multiple systems, including various knowledge management frameworks, ticketing systems, and databases, each siloed with its own format. Integrating this diverse information into a cohesive system is inherently complex an d requires a nuanced approach. Beyond these technical challenges, several external facto rs inﬂuence the adoption and implementation of emergent technologies like Large Language Models (LLMs): 7 Deploying Large Language Models with Retrieval Augmented G eneration • Legal and governance : Many organizations are cautious about exposing proprieta ry documents to external LLMs due to internal legal and compliance requirements. Thi s includes concerns about data security and the risks associated with hosting sensitive information outsi de the organization’s infrastructure or sharing it with third-party vendors. • Financing: Budgetary constraints often dictate whether an organizat ion can implement a solution in-house or must opt for outsourcing. While outsourcing might provid e a ready-to-use solution, it often comes with recurring subscription costs that can strain organization al budgets. On the other hand, in-house development requires a team with specialized skills for ongoing develop ment, maintenance, and support. • V olatility: The landscape of LLM technologies is rapidly evolving, with new libraries and frameworks emerg- ing frequently. This volatility presents challenges not on
