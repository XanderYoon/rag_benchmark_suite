un intentionally disclosed in generated responses. V erify that the RAG application adheres to data privacy regu lations and organizational policies, especially when dealing with sensitive proprietary information. To ac hieve this, we involved our legal and compliance team from the onset of the project. • User Experience and Feedback Integration User Acceptance T esting (UA T):Engage end-users in the testing process to collect insights on the system’s usability, relevance, and overall performance. This feedb ack is essential for ﬁne-tuning the application. Iterative T esting with Feedback Loops: Establish continuous feedback loops where user input drive s sub- sequent testing and development, ensuring the application evolves to meet changing user requirements. We shared the post-survey responses from the UA T phase and, dur ing the pilot run, encouraged users to actively 19 Deploying Large Language Models with Retrieval Augmented G eneration provide feedback through internal communication channels and emails. We closely tracked the key likes and dislikes about the application. • Long-T erm Monitoring and Evaluation Post-Deployment Monitoring: Implement ongoing monitoring of the RAG system after deploy ment, track- ing performance metrics, user satisfaction, and complianc e with governance standards. Periodic Audits: Conduct regular audits of the system’s performance and comp liance, revisiting and updating the ground truth dataset and testing protocols as necessary . • Ethical and Explainability T esting Explainability Analysis: Assess the system’s capability to offer clear explanations for its outputs, ensur- ing transparency and comprehensibility for end-users. We a chieved this by embedding links to the source documents. Ethical Considerations: Regularly evaluate the application for adherence to ethica l standards, particularly concerning the use and interpretation of proprietary data. The ’ConstitutionalChain’ feature in L ANGCHAIN [10] can be utilized to set predeﬁned rules that the LLM must f ollow. 5.1.1 Local testing During this study, we
