a method where each document in the retrieval list is indi- vidually used by the LLM, and the output is evaluated against ground truth labels for downstream tasks. Experiments show that eRAG improves corre- lation with downstream RAG performance and Kendall’s tau, while also being up to 50 times more efﬁcient in GPU memory usage compared to end-to-end evaluations. T5-small with Fusion-in- Decoder (FiD) as LLM, Mistral for evaluation of retrieved documents BM25, Faiss Benchmarking Large Language Models in Retrieval- Augmented Genera- tion [28] This study evaluates LLMs on noise robust- ness, negative rejection, information integration, and counterfactual ro- bustness for RAG. Findings indicate that LLMs exhibit a certain degree of noise robust- ness, struggle in terms of negative rejection, information integration, and dealing with false information.
