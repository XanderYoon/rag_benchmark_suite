end-users. We a chieved this by embedding links to the source documents. Ethical Considerations: Regularly evaluate the application for adherence to ethica l standards, particularly concerning the use and interpretation of proprietary data. The ’ConstitutionalChain’ feature in L ANGCHAIN [10] can be utilized to set predeﬁned rules that the LLM must f ollow. 5.1.1 Local testing During this study, we explored some of the emerging solution s like T RULENS [42], D EEP EVAL [43], L ANG SMITH by L ANG CHAIN [10], LlamaIndex [11] etc., which provide tools and capabil ities for evaluating RAG systems. One signiﬁcant challenge with LLMs is their tendency to "halluc inate" when information retrieval fails. Our study found that irrelevant LLM responses often stemmed from retrieval errors, such as when a document or its relevant chunk was not correctly retrieved in the top-n results. Recent res earch [44] also identiﬁes various points of failure in RAG systems, underscoring the importance of thorough evaluati on. For instance, open-source frameworks like L LAMA INDEX [11] provide tools such as R AGAS for assessing RAG performance metrics, including faithfulness, relevancy, context precision, and context recall. To use these tools, d e- velopers must create a ground truth dataset to evaluate the a pplication’s generated responses. Since such frameworks are still under active development, organizations must car efully consider their reliability before adoption. Additi on- ally, organizations might consider employing a parallel de velopment team to devise an automated testing strategy and methodology. Regardless of the chosen approach, it is cruci al to thoroughly evaluate these metrics. 5.1.2 Red teaming Red teaming, or adversarial testing, is a critical strategy for rigorously evaluating the robustness and security of a R AG system, particularly when deployed in sensitive or high-st akes environments. This approach involves deliberately challenging the system with
