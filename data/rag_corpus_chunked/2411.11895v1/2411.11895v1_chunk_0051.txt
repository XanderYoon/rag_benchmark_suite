of prompts, identifying areas for im provement and updating templates accordingly. Establish- ing feedback mechanisms is crucial for the continuous impro vement of prompt engineering. Teams should collect and analyze feedback from end-users and developers to reﬁne prompts and address any issues that arise during deployment. This iterative process helps to keep prompts relevant and ef fective in changing environments. In addition, comprehen- sive training and documentation are essential for ensuring that all team members understand how to create, use, and maintain prompt templates. Documentation should cover the principles of prompt engineering, provide examples of best practices, and offer guidance on troubleshooting comm on issues. Finally, effective prompt engineering governance require s input from various disciplines, including AI specialists , domain experts, and end-users. This cross-functional coll aboration approach ensures that prompts are not only tech- nically sound but also aligned with the speciﬁc needs of the a pplication and the users it serves. Prompt engineering governance should not be the sole responsibility of a single team. Instead, it should be a shared responsibility across the organization, with clear roles and responsibilities as signed to different teams. This approach ensures that promp t engineering remains a priority and that best practices are c onsistently applied across all projects. CI-CD (Continuous Improvement / Continuous Development) G overnance The rapidly changing landscape of AI technology necessitates a reevaluation of existing CI-CD p ractices. Organizations must adjust their frequency of dat a and code updates to stay aligned with the latest advancement s in AI vendor technologies. Additionally, changes in laws and regulations affecting AI implementations must be i ncorporated into these processes. 6.1.2 Risk Governance Risk governance provides oversight to assess and mitigate t he potential risks associated with AI implementations, ensuring that they do not adversely impact the organization ’s reputation
