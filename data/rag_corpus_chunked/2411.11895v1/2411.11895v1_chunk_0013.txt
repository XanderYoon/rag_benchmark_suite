implementing RAG systems in production. We outline the key technological decisions required when designing su ch a system, focusing on the various components of RAG. We begin by discussing the need for and background of develop ing an RAG-based system for information retrieval in our ﬁeld study, highlighting the main pain points in the ex isting system and the areas where RAG with LLMs was evaluated to add value. We then detail our design process, em phasizing our approach in light of user readiness for this human-AI system. 3.1 Domain Background In our ﬁeld study, focused on developing a pilot solution for an IT product company, the challenge of integrating LLMs like C HATGPT into socio-technical systems became particularly rele vant. The variability of product versions across different customer environments in IT companies demands a t rained support team capable of delivering prompt and accurate assistance. Addressing this need required a caref ully designed system involving extensive experimentation with prompt engineering, innovative data chunking, and ind exing methods, as well as iterative testing and reﬁnement to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the LLM-based solu tion. In IT organizations, support is often structured in multipl e tiers, including internal and customer-facing support. A l- though the initial design of our system was not meant for dire ct customer access, it was essential to develop it in a way 6 Deploying Large Language Models with Retrieval Augmented G eneration Figure 2: Domain Background Analysis - Identiﬁcation of Pro blem areas in the space that allows customer support teams to efﬁciently retrieve t he necessary information to address customer inquiries and escalations. As the system’s reliability and accuracy are v alidated, there may be potential to explore its direct use by end customers. In Figure 2, we identify key problem areas in
