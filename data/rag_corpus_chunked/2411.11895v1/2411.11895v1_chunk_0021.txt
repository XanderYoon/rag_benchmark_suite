landscape of available technologies is vast, with each offering uniqu e features, scalability options, and integration capabili ties. For instance, different LLMs vary in their context windows, multimodal capabilities, and accessibility, inﬂuencing their suitability for speciﬁc use cases. Similarly, the cho ice of vector databases, directly impacts the system’s abil ity to efﬁciently manage and search through large datasets. Fur thermore, the cloud provider must be carefully chosen to support the desired scalability, security, and complian ce needs. Each of these decisions must be tailored to the speciﬁc requirements of the business case, as the right comb ination can signiﬁcantly enhance the effectiveness of the RAG system while ensuring it meets the operational demands a nd strategic goals of the organization. In the following subsections, we explore the available options for each of th ese key components of the RAG system. 9 Deploying Large Language Models with Retrieval Augmented G eneration 3.4 Model Selection Criteria Table 3: Comparison of Large Language Models (LLMs) LLM Organization Multimodal?

It details key attributes such as whether each model supports multimodal inputs, its access methods, parameter sizes, token context windows, and open- source availability. For instance, GPT is not open-source. In contrast,
