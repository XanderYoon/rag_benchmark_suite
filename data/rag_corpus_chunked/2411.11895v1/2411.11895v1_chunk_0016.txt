a ready-to-use solution, it often comes with recurring subscription costs that can strain organization al budgets. On the other hand, in-house development requires a team with specialized skills for ongoing develop ment, maintenance, and support. • V olatility: The landscape of LLM technologies is rapidly evolving, with new libraries and frameworks emerg- ing frequently. This volatility presents challenges not on ly for in-house development but also when negoti- ating contracts with third-party vendors. Organizations m ust carefully consider the total cost of ownership, including the long-term costs associated with keeping the s ystem up-to-date. When developing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, particularly when using Large Language Models (LLMs) with proprietary documents, organizations must est ablish clear functional, non-functional, and technical re - quirements. (Please refer to Appendix A). In our ﬁeldwork, w e began this process by understanding the speciﬁc needs and expectations of stakeholders, including end-users, de velopers, and business leaders. The functional requiremen ts focus on the system’s core capabilities, such as natural lan guage understanding, contextual awareness, and integra- tion with existing systems. The non-functional requiremen ts, on the other hand, emphasize performance aspects like scalability, security, and reliability, ensuring the syst em can operate efﬁciently under varying conditions. Techni cal requirements detail the necessary infrastructure, tools, and frameworks that support the system’s development and operation. Stakeholder requirements and acceptance crite ria further reﬁne the project by aligning the system’s fea- tures with user needs and setting clear benchmarks for succe ss. Throughout this process, involving key teams—such as legal, compliance, engineering, customer support, and q uality assurance—ensured that the system not only met technical and functional standards but also adhered to orga nizational policies and regulations. During the initial phase, we conducted feasibility checks t o deﬁne the scope of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and
