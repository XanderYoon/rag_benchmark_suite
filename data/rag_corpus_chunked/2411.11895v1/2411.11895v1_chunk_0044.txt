automated testing strategy and methodology. Regardless of the chosen approach, it is cruci al to thoroughly evaluate these metrics. 5.1.2 Red teaming Red teaming, or adversarial testing, is a critical strategy for rigorously evaluating the robustness and security of a R AG system, particularly when deployed in sensitive or high-st akes environments. This approach involves deliberately challenging the system with edge cases, adversarial prompt s, or scenarios designed to provoke biased, harmful, or toxic responses. The goal is to uncover potential vulnerabi lities and weaknesses that might not be evident during standard testing processes. To implement red teaming effectively, organizations can de ploy a secondary LLM, known as an adversarial LLM, to generate challenging inputs. This adversarial LLM can be co nﬁgured to explore the limits of the primary system’s capabilities, testing its response to extreme or unexpecte d situations. For example, it might introduce queries that p ush the boundaries of the system’s ethical guidelines or attemp t to elicit biased or misleading information. The insights gained from red teaming are invaluable for reﬁn ing the system’s safeguards, ensuring that it can handle a wide range of real-world scenarios without compromising o n ethical standards or data integrity. Additionally, this process can help in identifying areas where further trainin g or reinforcement of the LLM is necessary, contributing to the development of a more resilient and trustworthy AI sys tem. Regular red teaming exercises, combined with iterative improvements based on the ﬁndings, are essential for maintaining the long-term security and reliability of RAG systems in any operational environment. 5.1.3 User acceptance test with pilot users To evaluate the practical application of our system, we cond ucted alpha testing with pilot users, measuring both qualitative and quantitative metrics through post-survey questionnaires (Please refer Appendix C).
