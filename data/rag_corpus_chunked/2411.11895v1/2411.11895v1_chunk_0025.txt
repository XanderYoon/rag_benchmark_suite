The choice depends on factors such as the required scalability, the nat ure of the data, and integration needs with existing systems . For successful RAG deployment, organizations must match th e vector store’s features with their speciﬁc use cases and operational requirements. For example, businesses needin g robust distributed deployment and ﬂexibility might opt fo r Weaviate or Qdrant, while those focusing on real-time searc h and personalization could beneﬁt from Chroma. Under- standing these differences ensures that the selected vector store aligns with the project’s goals, optimizing perform ance and efﬁciency in handling diverse data sources and retrieva l tasks. 11 Deploying Large Language Models with Retrieval Augmented G eneration 3.6 Cloud V endor Selection and AI Ops Table 5: Comparison of AI Cloud Platforms A WS Microsoft Azure Google Cloud Platform (GCP) IBM Cloud Oracle Cloud Service Breadth and Depth Extensive AI/ML offerings for vari- ous use cases.
