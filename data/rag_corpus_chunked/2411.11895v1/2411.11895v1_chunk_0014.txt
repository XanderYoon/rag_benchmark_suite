Domain Background Analysis - Identiﬁcation of Pro blem areas in the space that allows customer support teams to efﬁciently retrieve t he necessary information to address customer inquiries and escalations. As the system’s reliability and accuracy are v alidated, there may be potential to explore its direct use by end customers. In Figure 2, we identify key problem areas in the current stat e. The ﬁrst pain point is the frequent back-and-forth communication between the customer support team and the engineer- ing team, which is time-consuming and disruptive. This chal lenge stems from the need for customer support teams to meet Service Level Agreements (SLAs) by providing timely an d accurate responses to customer tickets. Ensuring the accuracy of responses requires veriﬁcation across various product documents, which differ by product and version. By improving the efﬁciency of information retrieval from thes e documents, these pain points can be mitigated, enabling support teams to meet SLAs more effectively. The second pain point is the fragmented nature of informatio n sources within most organizations. Information is often spread across multiple knowledge management systems, tick eting systems, databases, and other formats, each in its own silo. The integration of information across these dispa rate systems is complex and presents a signiﬁcant challenge . 3.2 Challenges and Opportunities In most organizations, retrieving information is not just a bout obtaining data; it’s about doing so quickly, accuratel y, and in a user-friendly manner. The ideal solution would allo w for natural language queries without requiring users to have expertise in complex querying languages like SQL. Ad ditionally, the information retrieved should be easy to understand or even summarized for the user’s convenience. A signiﬁcant challenge lies in the evolution of knowledge ma nagement systems alongside the organization itself. This evolution often results in inconsistencies in
