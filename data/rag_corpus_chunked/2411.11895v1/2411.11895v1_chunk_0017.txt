clear benchmarks for succe ss. Throughout this process, involving key teams—such as legal, compliance, engineering, customer support, and q uality assurance—ensured that the system not only met technical and functional standards but also adhered to orga nizational policies and regulations. During the initial phase, we conducted feasibility checks t o deﬁne the scope of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and to plan a roadmap for incremental development. This appr oach is crucial as it ensures that the system design remains ﬂexible enough to evolve over time, allowing for adj ustments as the technology and organizational needs change. Feasibility analysis and careful planning are crit ical to the overall success of the project, ensuring that the ﬁnal product meets both the technical and business requirem ents of the organization. To ensure the solution met user needs, we assembled a cross-f unctional team to collaboratively design the system. This approach enabled users to actively participate not onl y in deﬁning requirements and conducting ﬁnal acceptance testing but also in the iterative development and evaluatio n phases. By involving users throughout the process, the design was continuously reﬁned, aligning more closely with their expectations and operational realities. 3.3 User Readiness To assess user readiness and the acceptance of the new genera tive AI-based Information Retrieval System, we dis- tributed a pre-survey questionnaire among the pilot group o f users selcted randomly across various departments. This survey was a key step in our process, as it aimed to capture the users’ familiarity with generative AI, their expecta- tions, potential concerns, and overall sentiment towards t he new technology. (Please refer to Table 2 for the pre-surve y analysis summary) • Experience with Generative AI: The survey revealed that 54% of users had prior experience with generative AI, though the level of expertise varied.
