code updates to stay aligned with the latest advancement s in AI vendor technologies. Additionally, changes in laws and regulations affecting AI implementations must be i ncorporated into these processes. 6.1.2 Risk Governance Risk governance provides oversight to assess and mitigate t he potential risks associated with AI implementations, ensuring that they do not adversely impact the organization ’s reputation or operational integrity: T echnology Risk Due to the emergent nature of AI, coupled with its rapid evolu tion, AI-based applications face heightened risks. These risks must be regularly evaluated a nd addressed through comprehensive risk management strategies, ensuring that the AI systems remain robust and r eliable over time. V endor ManagementWhile the fundamentals of vendor management remain largely unchanged, the evaluation and onboarding of AI vendors require careful consideration. Or ganizations must assess whether new AI models utilize data responsibly, comply with enterprise contracts, and me et security standards before integration. Evaluation and On-boarding The evaluation of newer models and whether those utilize the data sent for training has to be considered before on-boarding the new AI models and tec hnologies. Evaluating enterprise contracts and security compliance is also part of the evaluation and onboarding gov ernance. Legal and Compliance Keeping abreast of the dynamic regulatory environment surr ounding AI is crucial. Organiza- tions must establish governance frameworks that ensure com pliance with evolving legal requirements and guide the implementation of AI systems in line with these standards. 23 Deploying Large Language Models with Retrieval Augmented G eneration 6.1.3 Humanitarian Governance Humanitarian governance focuses on the socio-technologic al impacts of AI systems, particularly on human-AI inter- actions, ethics, and organizational culture: Ethical Governance AI implementations must adhere to established ethical norm s. This governance ensures that AI systems are developed and deployed in a manner that respects human
