challenges of RAG systems. Key studies include the foundational work [19] that showed how incorporat- ing retrieval into individual tasks with a single retrieval -based architecture is capable of achieving strong perform ance 3 Deploying Large Language Models with Retrieval Augmented G eneration across several tasks. The survey [21] highlights RAG’s appl ications across multiple NLP tasks but notes areas needing improvement, such as optimization and multi-modalities. O ther surveys [22], [25], and [24] further categorize and review RAG techniques, discussing the limitations and futu re directions for RAG implementation in the industry, as well as discussing different RAG paradigms, including thei r application to various data stores and knowledge graphs. Practical evaluations and benchmarking are addressed in st udies [27] and [28], which propose new methods for as- sessing RAG performance and robustness. V arious studies pr opose performance improvement approaches, including [26], which explores advanced implementations like RAG- END 2END , [29], which proposes a “Hybrid with HyDE” method for retrieval, and [30] proposes a Forward-Looking A ctive REtrieval augmented generation (FLARE). Some studies [31] provide solutions on RAG methods across hetero geneous knowledge. Others explore improved evaluation approaches such as [32], which proposes a Corrective Retrie val Augmented Generation (CRAG), a retrieval evaluator that can be coupled with various RAG approaches to improve th e robustness of generation. These studies underscore the growing academic interest in RAG.
