By adopting these governance practices, orga- nizations can deploy RAG systems effectively while adherin g to compliance standards and mitigating potential risks such as bias or misinformation. Integrating these insights into AI governance contributes to the broader discourse on responsible AI deployment and offers a practical framework for organizations aiming to harness the potential of RAG systems. Given the complex challenges revealed by our ﬁeld study, it i s essential for industry and academia to collaborate more closely to advance AI technologies in a manner that is both in novative and responsible. By sharing the real-world difﬁculties encountered during implementations, researc h in the ﬁeld of LLM and RAG systems can be signiﬁcantly accelerated. This collaboration will not only reﬁne best pr actices and governance models but also foster the develop- ment of robust, reliable, and compliant AI solutions that ca n be widely adopted across various industries. This study enhances the growing body of knowledge on RAG syst ems by providing a comprehensive analysis of the technical, organizational, and human challenges invol ved in their implementation. Our ﬁndings highlight the importance of a holistic approach that integrates AI govern ance, user engagement, and continuous evaluation, offering a roadmap for organizations looking to adopt RAG-based solu tions in a dynamic technological landscape. 8 Conclusion This study has highlighted the key challenges and opportuni ties associated with implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using large language models (LLMs ). While RAG is emerging as a signiﬁcant application of LLMs, our ﬁndings indicate that it remains in its early sta ges, with many organizations still navigating the complex- ities of its deployment. The rapid evolution of underlying t echnologies adds to the challenge, making it a continuously moving target. In addition to addressing technical challenges, our resear ch has also contributed to AI
