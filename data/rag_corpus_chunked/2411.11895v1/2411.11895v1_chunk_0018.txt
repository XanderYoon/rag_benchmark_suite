as it aimed to capture the users’ familiarity with generative AI, their expecta- tions, potential concerns, and overall sentiment towards t he new technology. (Please refer to Table 2 for the pre-surve y analysis summary) • Experience with Generative AI: The survey revealed that 54% of users had prior experience with generative AI, though the level of expertise varied. This indicated a mo derate level of familiarity within the user base, suggesting that additional training might be necessary to b ring all users to a similar level of comfort. • Perceived Beneﬁts: Users highlighted several potential beneﬁts of the AI syste m, including improved accu- racy and relevance of retrieved information, faster access to data, and enhanced troubleshooting capabilities. There was also a strong expectation that the system would str eamline cross-functional communication and reduce the need for frequent meetings. About 8% of users, how ever, were unsure whether AI would signiﬁ- cantly impact their efﬁciency, indicating a need for clear d emonstrations of the system’s value. • Expectations: Enthusiasm for the application was high, with some users ant icipating that it would foster inclusivity, transparency, and collaboration across the o rganization. However, 20% of respondents were uncertain about what to expect, reﬂecting a need for better c ommunication and expectation management. • Concerns: While many users were excited, there were notable concerns, including issues related to ques- tion phrasing, the accuracy and reliability of AI responses , data privacy and security, and the potential for over-reliance on AI. Some users also feared that such a tool c ould eventually replace human jobs.
