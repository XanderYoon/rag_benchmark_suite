T5 Dense retriever model DPR Corrective Retrieval Augmented Genera- tion [32] This study introduces Corrective Retrieval Augmented Generation (CRAG) as a retrieval evaluator to enhance the robustness of RAG approaches. Experiments on four datasets show that CRAG signiﬁcantly enhances RAG-based performance in both short- and long- form tasks. s LLaMA2- chat13B, Chat- GPT, CoVE65B LLaMA2- 7B,13B, Alpaca- 7B,13B, SAIL, T5-based Re- trieval Evaluator Despite the extensive research, there is a noticeable lack o f ﬁeld studies and industry-shared experiences that could bridge the gap between theoretical research and practical a pplication. For RAG systems to fully realize their potentia l, research must be conducted in tandem with industry implemen tations. This collaboration would help address real- world challenges, such as managing heterogeneous data sources, integrating separate knowledge bases, and optimizing system performance for production environments. Sharing ﬁ eld studies and insights from industry implementations can signiﬁcantly enhance research, enabling more robust so lutions that cater to the complex demands of real-world applications. Given the complexity of real-world applications, particul arly in industry settings that involve intricate socio-tec hnical systems, more detailed research is needed to study the imple mentation and deployment of RAG systems in the ﬁeld as pilot projects in the industry and their maturation
