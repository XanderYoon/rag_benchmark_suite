the AI to retrieve data from various enterprise systems and document formats. N/A Uncertain About Data Needs Users who were uncertain about their data expectations. 8% Excitement and Gratitude Users who expressed excitement and gratitude for being part of the pilot program. 25% 41% of respondents did not express any concerns, suggesting varying levels of apprehension about the new technology. • Data Needs: The majority of users expressed a need for the system to retri eve data across various enterprise systems, in addition to documents in multiple formats. Abou t 8% of users were uncertain about what data the AI should provide, indicating a need for clearer guidelines on the system’s capabilities. • General Sentiment: Overall, the sentiment was positive, with 25% of users expre ssing excitement and grat- itude for being part of the pilot program. This enthusiasm wi ll likely aid in the system’s adoption, provided that their concerns are adequately addressed through train ing and iterative improvements. This pre-survey analysis underscores the importance of add ressing user concerns and managing expectations while leveraging the enthusiasm and existing familiarity with ge nerative AI to facilitate a smooth rollout of the new system. (Please refer to Appendix B for details on our pre-survey que stions and its analysis). In the development of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG ) systems, selecting the right model, vector database, and cloud provider is critical to ensuring optimal performa nce and alignment with business objectives. The landscape of available technologies is vast, with each offering uniqu e features, scalability options, and integration capabili ties. For instance, different LLMs vary in their context windows, multimodal capabilities, and accessibility, inﬂuencing their suitability for speciﬁc use cases. Similarly, the cho ice of vector databases, directly impacts the system’s abil ity to efﬁciently manage and search through large datasets. Fur
