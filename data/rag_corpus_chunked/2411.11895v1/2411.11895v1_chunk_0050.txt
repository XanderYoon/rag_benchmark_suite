for easy customization while maintaining a core structure that ensures reliability. In a ddition, using a modular design, such as breaking the prompt into sections for preﬁx, context, instructions, and output format, allows teams to reuse and repurpose different secti ons of the prompt across various scenarios, enhancing efﬁcienc y and reducing the need for constant re-engineering. To enable reusability and ﬂexibility, we propose establish ing a library of prompt templates, thus enablimg teams to access a repository of well-tested prompts that can be adapt ed for various use cases. This reduces development time and ensures that best practices are consistently applied ac ross the organization. To manage the evolution of prompt templates, version control should be implemented. This all ows teams to track changes, revert to previous versions if necessary, and ensure that updates are systematically ap plied across all relevant systems. V ersion control also facilitates collaboration, enabling multiple teams to con tribute to and reﬁne prompt templates over time. While stan- dardization is important, prompts must also be ﬂexible enou gh to adapt to speciﬁc contexts or scenarios. Governance should include guidelines on how to modify prompts for diffe rent applications while maintaining the core principles of clarity, accuracy, and efﬁciency. For maintenance and continuous improvement, prompt templa tes should undergo regular audits to ensure they remain effective and aligned with the latest developments in AI tec hnology and organizational needs. These audits should assess the performance of prompts, identifying areas for im provement and updating templates accordingly. Establish- ing feedback mechanisms is crucial for the continuous impro vement of prompt engineering. Teams should collect and analyze feedback from end-users and developers to reﬁne prompts and address any issues that arise during deployment. This iterative process helps to keep prompts relevant and ef fective in changing environments.
