by the available infrastructure for hosting, the c ost associated with token usage, and the overall billing rat es. While larger models generally excel at complex reasoning tasks, smaller models that have been ﬁne-tuned can often de- liver superior performance for speciﬁc tasks [35]. This mak es model selection not just a technical decision but also one that involves strategic consideration of the trade-offs be tween performance, cost, and alignment with organizationa l goals. 3.5 V ector Database Selection The table 4 provides a comparative overview of several vecto r stores—Weaviate, Faiss, Chroma, Qdrant, and Mil- vus—highlighting their key features, use cases, scalabili ty, and integration capabilities. Each vector store offers dis- tinct advantages tailored to speciﬁc needs in Retrieval-Au gmented Generation (RAG) implementations. For instance, Weaviate excels in hybrid search with ﬂexible schema suppor t and built-in ML model integration, making it suitable for semantic search and knowledge graphs. Faiss, known for i ts high performance and various indexing strategies, is ideal for large datasets and similarity searches. Chroma st ands out with real-time search capabilities and a simple API , which is advantageous for applications requiring real-tim e vector search and personalization. Qdrant offers advance d indexing and distributed deployment, supporting similarity search and recommendation systems. Milvus, with its high performance and multiple indexing options, is well-suited for large-scale vector searches and data analysis. 10 Deploying Large Language Models with Retrieval Augmented G eneration Table 4: Comparison of various V ector Stores V ector Store Key Features Use Cases Scalability Integration Indexing Weaviate Hybrid search (vec- tor + keyword), Scalable, Flexible schema, Built-in ML model support, RESTful API / GraphQL Semantic search, Knowl- edge graphs, Recommenda- tion systems High, supports distributed de- ployment ML frameworks, REST API, GraphQL Hybrid search capabilities Faiss High performance, V arious indexing strategies,
