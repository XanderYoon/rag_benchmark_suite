offered by each platform. This comparison aims to highlight the strengths a nd limitations of each provider, helping users select the most appropriate cloud platform for their speciﬁc AI needs a nd operational contexts. 12 Deploying Large Language Models with Retrieval Augmented G eneration It is essential to ensure that the design process lays a robus t foundation for developing a reliable and efﬁcient system. By carefully selecting appropriate models, cloud infrastr ucture, and AI operations strategies, we align the system’s architecture with the organization’s technical requireme nts and user expectations. With the design principles ﬁrmly established, the next phase, the implementation phase, can focus on translating these design elements into a functiona l software prototype. The forthcoming Implementation secti on will detail the construction of the system, including workﬂow diagrams, prompt engineering, and semantic retrie val to enable the transformation of the design into a tangible, operational system. 4 Implementation In the implementation phase, we transitioned from design to development, bringing the planned system architecture to life through a functional software prototype. This phase fo cused on translating the theoretical framework and design principles into a tangible system, ensuring that each compo nent aligned with the speciﬁed requirements. We metic- ulously deﬁned the system architecture, emphasizing the in tegration of various modules and the ﬂow of information between them. The workﬂow, as depicted in Figures 3 and 4, sho wcases the algorithm’s overall structure, guiding the sequence of operations within the system. The subsequent se ctions provide a detailed breakdown of the implemen- tation steps, highlighting key decisions, challenges enco untered, and the strategies employed to achieve the desired functionality. 4.1 Workﬂow After outlining the system architecture and detailing the d esign principles, we focus on the operational workﬂow of the prototype. This workﬂow is central to the system’s
