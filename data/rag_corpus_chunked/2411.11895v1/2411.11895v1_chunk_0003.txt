AI systems, and those we encountered in our ﬁeld study. We suggest best practice reco mmendations for organizations venturing into the space of generative AI with RAG. We hope that this paper, detailing our challenges and insights, will not only serve as a valuable guide for organizations planning to implement RAG-based solutions using LLMs but also provide researchers with a deeper understanding of the real-world challenges fa ced in the industry when adopting new technology. The structure of this paper is as follows: We begin by explori ng the research efforts aimed at enabling LLMs to adapt to domain-speciﬁc contexts, focusing on ﬁne-tuning a nd prompt engineering. Following this, we delve into the work conducted with RAG to date. We then provide the backg round for our ﬁeld study and detail the design of the pilot project, discussing the various challenges faced by the industry in developing such a system and the wide array of choices available for each component of the RAG syst em. Next, we outline the implementation of our pilot project, including the design choices and our approach to ex ecution. We also address the importance and challenges of evaluating such a system, reviewing the different evaluati on strategies, including those we employed. Our ﬁeldwork insights, best practices, and the necessity of AI governanc e are discussed subsequently. Finally, we examine the implications of deploying these systems in production, wit h a particular focus on the challenges of human-artiﬁcial intelligence collaboration, to promote the development of robust, reliable, and compliant AI solutions across variou s industries. The paper concludes with a summary of our ﬁnding s. 2 Related Work Prior to LLMs, the approaches to retrieval of information fr om unstructured text included statistical and machine learning-based approaches.
