Governance Production governance ensures that AI systems are managed e ffectively once deployed, encompassing monitoring, disaster recovery, business continuity, incident management production support, etc. Data Governance Data governance for AI systems must be restructured to accou nt for the dynamic nature of data that can modify AI models and outputs. This involves implementin g stringent data quality controls and ensuring that the data feeding into AI models is reliable and accurate. Operational Governance While operational governance practices such as staff backu ps, rotation schedules, and in- cident management remain largely applicable to AI systems, they must be ﬁne-tuned to accommodate the speciﬁc operational needs of AI technologies. Production Support and Assurance AI-based systems require specialized production support. Organizations must equip their production support teams with the necessary tra ining and resources to handle the unique challenges posed by AI systems, ensuring that they can provide effective and t imely support. This AI governance model is based on our learnings from this ﬁ eld study and is designed to provide a comprehensive framework that organizations can adopt to manage the complexities of AI deployment. By integrating these governance practices, organizations can ensure that their AI systems a re not only effective but also ethical, compliant, and resil ient in the face of evolving technological and regulatory landsc apes. 6.2 Best Practices In our ﬁeld study, we experimented with various prompt patte rns [38] and explored different aspects of Retrieval- Augmented Generation (RAG) to develop best practices for bu ilding LLM-based systems. The following recommen- dations are grounded in lessons learned from our build-test cycles and are designed to address key areas such as data governance, system design, user engagement, and ongoing ev aluation. 6.2.1 Prompt Engineering Prompt Structure: RAG allows LLMs to stay focused and minimize hallucinationsby providing clear context through
