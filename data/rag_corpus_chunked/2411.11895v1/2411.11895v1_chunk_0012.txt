enhance research, enabling more robust so lutions that cater to the complex demands of real-world applications. Given the complexity of real-world applications, particul arly in industry settings that involve intricate socio-tec hnical systems, more detailed research is needed to study the imple mentation and deployment of RAG systems in the ﬁeld as pilot projects in the industry and their maturation into p roduction. Such research should assess the maturity of this approach, identify and address process gaps, and gener ate ideas to enhance the reliability and adoption of RAG systems. Collaboration between industry and academia is, t herefore, essential, as sharing the challenges faced in the ﬁeld can signiﬁcantly advance research on LLMs and RAG. Furt hermore, it is crucial to establish best practices based on industry learning and to create a governance framework that ensures compliance with regulatory requirements when deploying RAG technologies. 3 Design The advent of large language models (LLMs) like C HATGPT has revolutionized the way information can be retrieved from proprietary documents. However, given the relative im maturity of these models, their integration into socio- technical systems must be meticulously designed to ensure t hat the ﬁnal solution is both reliable and accurate. This design process involves extensive experimentation with pr ompt engineering, innovative strategies for data chunking , indexing, and retrieval, as well as iterative and thorough t esting of the entire system. In this section, we explore the challenges and opportunitie s of implementing RAG systems in production. We outline the key technological decisions required when designing su ch a system, focusing on the various components of RAG. We begin by discussing the need for and background of develop ing an RAG-based system for information retrieval in our ﬁeld study, highlighting the main pain points in the ex isting system and the areas
