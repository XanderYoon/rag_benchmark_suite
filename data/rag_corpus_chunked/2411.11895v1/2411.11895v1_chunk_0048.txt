ulatory requirements, and organizational goals. The study 21 Deploying Large Language Models with Retrieval Augmented G eneration Figure 5: AI Governance Model underscores the complexities involved in adopting RAG technology, including the need for stringent data management practices, transparency in AI decision-making, and the con tinuous monitoring of AI systems to mitigate risks such as bias, misinformation, and unintended consequences. From what we have learned, we provide a foundation for develo ping best practices that organizations can adopt to navigate the challenges of implementing RAG. These best practices address key areas such as data governance, system design, user engagement, and ongoing evaluation, all of whi ch are essential for maximizing the beneﬁts of RAG while minimizing potential pitfalls. By sharing these insights, we aim to contribute to the broader discourse on AI governance and offer actionable guidance for organizations looking to harness the power of RAG in a responsible and sustainable manner. 6.1 AI Governance In our ﬁeld study, we developed an AI governance model design ed to address the unique challenges posed by AI sys- tems, particularly those involving Retrieval-Augmented G eneration (RAG). Our proposed governance model includes both enhancements to existing governance frameworks and th e introduction of novel governance practices speciﬁ- cally tailored to AI technologies. The model is divided into four broad categories: Architectural and Technological Governance, Risk Governance, Humanitarian Governance, an d Production Governance. (Please refer Figure 5) Each category addresses critical aspects of AI system implement ation, ensuring that organizations can effectively manage the complexities of AI deployment while adhering to ethical , legal, and operational standards. 6.1.1 Architectural and T echnological Governance Given the distinct differences between AI systems and tradi tional information systems, signiﬁcant updates to archite c- tural and technological governance are required: Architectural Review Board For AI implementations, the Architectural
