critical. We review previous re search that highlights this necessity [45] [46] [47], which primarily addresses global issues concerning the developm ent, deployment, and regulation of AI, including its in- tended purposes and limitations. Additionally, research h as explored AI governance at the organizational level, whic h we use as the basis and adopt the deﬁnition stated [48]: "AI governance is a system of rules, practices, processes, a nd technological tools designed to ensure that an organiza- tion’s use of AI technologies aligns with its strategies, ob jectives, and values; complies with legal requirements; an d adheres to the ethical AI principles upheld by the organizat ion." Building on this deﬁnition and insights from our pilot study , we propose an AI governance model, particularly for emerging technologies such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). RAG represents a signiﬁcant advancement in AI, enabling large language models (LLMs) to produce more ac curate and contextually relevant outputs by integrating external data sources that are not part of the original train ing data. However, the implementation of RAG in real-world scenarios presents unique challenges, particularly when t ransitioning from research concepts to industry applicati ons. In this section, we share the intersection of AI governance a nd the practical deployment of RAG, drawing on insights from this ﬁeld study. Here, we share the importance of AI gove rnance in ensuring that RAG implementations are not only effective but also aligned with ethical standards, reg ulatory requirements, and organizational goals. The study 21 Deploying Large Language Models with Retrieval Augmented G eneration Figure 5: AI Governance Model underscores the complexities involved in adopting RAG technology, including the need for stringent data management practices, transparency in AI decision-making, and the con tinuous monitoring of AI systems to mitigate risks such as bias, misinformation, and unintended consequences.
