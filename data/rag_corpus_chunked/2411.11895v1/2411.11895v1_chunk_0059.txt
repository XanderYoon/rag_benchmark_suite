these issues can be mitigated, leadi ng to improved overall system performance and user satisfaction. In addressing the challenges we faced, we encountered issues similar to those documented by Hevner et al. [14] in their research on the design of human-artiﬁcial intelligence sys tems (HAIS). These challenges included selecting appropri - ate technologies amid legal and compliance constraints, ma naging the complexity of integrating diverse data sources, and evaluating the effectiveness of LLM-based application s. Each of these issues required careful consideration and iterative problem-solving, such as modular design, user fe edback through pre-surveys, and the strategic use of tools like T RULENS [42], D EEP EVAL [43], L ANG SMITH by L ANG CHAIN [10], etc., for evaluation. In addition, the implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Ge neration (RAG) systems in real-world scenarios necessi- tates a robust AI governance framework to ensure ethical, le gal, and operational integrity. As AI technologies evolve, especially with advancements like RAG, governance models must adapt to address new challenges, including architec- tural design, risk management, and the socio-technical imp acts on human-AI interactions. Our ﬁeld study insights laid the groundwork for developing t he proposed AI governance model tailored speciﬁcally to RAG systems, with a focus on key areas such as prompt engine ering, data governance, and continuous evaluation. This governance model emphasizes the importance of maintai ning transparency, ensuring ethical AI deployment, and managing risks associated with the rapid evolution of AI tec hnologies. By adopting these governance practices, orga- nizations can deploy RAG systems effectively while adherin g to compliance standards and mitigating potential risks such as bias or misinformation. Integrating these insights into AI governance contributes to the broader discourse on responsible AI deployment and offers a practical framework for organizations aiming to harness the potential of RAG systems.
