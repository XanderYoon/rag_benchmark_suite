HATGPT API. We are using the GPT-4-Turbo model [37]. 11. When we get a response from C HATGPT, we send it back to the user interface (UI) for formatting and presentation. Below is a sample of the response with proprie tary information redacted.

Prompts are natural language text written to instruct an LLM. There are various approaches to prompting, such as zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, and REACT prompting [6] [9] [7]. Many of the libraries now provide prompt templates that could be used for generating standardized prompts. This helps in structuring and organizing your prompts as well as standa rdizing them for maintenance. Using certain instructions has been shown to reduce hallucinations [39] (for example, Answer ONLY with the facts listed in the sources below. If there isn’t enough information below, say you don’t know. DO NOT generate answers that don’t use the sources below. If asking a clarifying question to the user would help , ask the question ). To ensure security, we ensured that CHATGPT did not generate any code or SQL queries in their response (for example,
