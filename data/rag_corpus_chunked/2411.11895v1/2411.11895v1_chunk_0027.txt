The success of any AI application, especially those leverag ing large language models, is closely tied to the infrastruc - ture and services provided by major cloud providers. Studie s [36] show that cloud giants like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google offer a comprehensive suite of AI and infrastruct ure services, including compute power, application de- velopment, security and compliance, and industry-speciﬁc solutions, underscoring the integral role of these cloud platforms in supporting AI development. These services are integral to the development, deployment, and scaling of AI applications. Choosing the right cloud vendor is a critical decision that m ust be made early in the project. This decision impacts not only the development and deployment phases but also the long -term sustainability and scalability of the AI application . Enterprises must plan for the ongoing management of AI opera tions (AI Ops) within their broader cloud strategy, ensuring that AI applications can evolve and adapt in line wi th both technological advancements and business needs. Table 5 provides a comparative analysis of major AI cloud platforms—AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), IBM Cloud, and Oracle Cloud—across several key perfo rmance indicators (KPIs) relevant to AI operations (AI Ops). The table examines the service breadth and depth, e ase of use and integration, performance and scalability, cost efﬁciency, AI-optimized hardware, generative AI capa bility, and the support and community offered by each platform. This comparison aims to highlight the strengths a nd limitations of each provider, helping users select the most appropriate cloud platform for their speciﬁc AI needs a nd operational contexts. 12 Deploying Large Language Models with Retrieval Augmented G eneration It is essential to ensure that the design process lays a robus t foundation for developing
