Databases: Experimenting with various vector databases and search mec hanisms is crucial for optimizing RAG systems. We tested databases like Chroma, Pinecone, and Elastic Relevance Search Engine and compared dif- ferent search strategies, including exact-match and seman tic search, or a combination of both. Proper data governance involves selecting and managing these databases to ensure d ata accuracy, consistency, and privacy throughout the re- trieval process. Establishing clear guidelines for data ha ndling, storage, and retrieval is essential for maintainin g the integrity of the information used by RAG systems. 6.2.3 System Design Modular Architecture: Given the rapidly evolving nature of AI technologies, desig ning the application in modular, decoupled components is advisable. This approach allows fo r easier updates and integration of new features without disrupting the entire system. Thorough planning of the arch itecture before building the prototype is essential. Ex- tensive logging should be implemented to track which docume nts were retrieved for speciﬁc user queries and what responses were generated. This not only aids in debugging bu t also supports ongoing evaluation and improvement of the system. LLM Considerations: Selecting the right AI provider is critical. Enterprise acc ounts offer more reliable API access and support, which is particularly important for large-sca le applications. It’s beneﬁcial to compare the capabilitie s of cloud-based LLMs (e.g., those offered by Google V ertex AI or Microsoft Azure OpenAI) with locally hosted, ﬁne- tuned models on proprietary data. Each option has distinct a dvantages, depending on the business case, and should be evaluated in terms of scalability, cost, and data security. 6.2.4 User Engagement Human Factors: Engaging end users early in the development process is key to creating a system that meets their needs. Request users to provide a set of frequently used ques tions for quality testing and
