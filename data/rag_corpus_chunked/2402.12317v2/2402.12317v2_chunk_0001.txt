generation (RAG) paradigm has raised significant attention due to its efficiency in adapting large language models (LLMs) without training (Guu et al., 2020; Karpukhin et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2023; Borgeaud et al., 2022; Asai et al., 2023). Recent research has demonstrated its successful applications in code generation. They implement the retrieval-augmented code generation (RACG) Write ponyc code to print odd numbers from 0 to n (inclusive) Query GeneratorCode … The Pony if condition allows actions when a condition is true.

Furthermore, the unique characteristic of execution in code generation en- ables more information collected on-the-fly. For instance,
