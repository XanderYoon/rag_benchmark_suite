collected data, and confirm that the data that was collected/used does not contain any information that names or uniquely identifies individual people or offensive content. K Intended use EVOR is an advanced pipeline for RACG, and it is expected to be applied in customized code gen- eration. EVOR-BENCH consists of four realistic benchmarks for RACG, and is expected to be used as an evaluation benchmark to evaluate RACG sys- tems. L License Our code and data will be released under Apache- 2.0 license. M Data Documentation EVOR-BENCH is collected from LeetCode and adapted from DS-1000 (Lai et al., 2023), which was originally collected from StackOverflow. The data in EVOR-BENCH is all in English. N Machines We run all experiments on Nvidia A100 GPUs. It takes around 1 hour to finish one dataset in EVOR- BENCH . To complete all the experiments in the paper, it tasks around 24 hours. O Packages For all the packages we use in the code, we em- ploy the pip or conda implementation in the latest version. P Instructions for Human Annotators • Write the code in the corresponding program- ming languages to the problem • Find the documentation of the syntax used in the code. Q Data Consent We adapt data from DS1000 (Lai et al., 2023), which is released under CC-BY-SA-4.0 license. Some of the data is collected from LeetCode, which is a public platform for practicing coding skills.
