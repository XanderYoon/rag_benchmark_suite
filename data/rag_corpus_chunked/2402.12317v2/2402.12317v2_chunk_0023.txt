scalabil- ity of LLMs in realistic scenarios. 8 Potential Risk The use of retrieval-augmented code generation with large language models introduces several po- tential risks, primarily centered around the quality and relevance of the retrieved code snippets. There is a risk of biased or incorrect information being re- trieved, which could propagate errors or introduce vulnerabilities into generated code. Additionally, there are concerns about privacy and security if sensitive code snippets are inadvertently included in the retrieval process. Addressing these risks re- quires careful curation of retrieval sources, robust validation mechanisms, and continuous monitoring to ensure the integrity and safety of the generated code.
