initiating requests: pruning and effective expansion. 3 Tree of Reviews Framework 3.1 Overall The task is to answer a multi-hop question Q based on a retrieval corpus D. As illustrated in Figure 2, we introduce TREE OF REVIEWS (TOR), a tree- based dynamic retrieval framework. In this frame- work, the root node is the question Q, while each subsequent node is a paragraph with a paragraphs review block (Sec.3.2). These blocks dynamically judge whether to stop or continue the search based on all paragraphs along the path from the root node to the current node. If there are enough paragraphs to answer Q, the model will use them to produce evidence and add it to the evidence pool. Upon reviewing all paths, the reader generates the final response to Q based on the evidence in the evidence pool. We propose three evidence fusion strategies (Sec.3.3) to fully use information from diverse rea- soning paths. Additionally, we propose two tree- based search optimization methods (Sec.3.4): prun- ing and effective expansion. These methods aim to enhance the search efficiency of the TOR frame- work. 3.2 Paragraphs Review The TOR framework initiates multiple retrievals, utilizing both the original question Q and new queries generated by the paragraphs review block. We use a dense retriever proposed by Izacard et al. (2023) to encode both the query and the retrieval corpus D and then compute the similarity score of their embeddings by cosine similarity. We expand a child node for each retrieved 3 Figure 2: The left side illustrates the overall TOR framework (introduced in Section 3.1).
