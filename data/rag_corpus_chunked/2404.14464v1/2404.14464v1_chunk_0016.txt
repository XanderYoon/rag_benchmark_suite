the reader. As shown by Ta- ble 3, generating the final answer based on both retrieved paragraphs and analysis yields optimal performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of our search process. A significant gap exists be- tween performance derived from analysis and those from paragraphs, indicating that when there are Method HotpotQA 2WikiMQA MuSiQue Analysis 56.8 52.0 40.4 Paragraph 64.6 62.3 46.0 Evidence 65.5 63.7 46.2 Table 3: Answer F1 with different evidence fusion strate- gies. conflicts between different pieces of evidence, the model needs to incorporate information from the retrieved paragraphs to better resolve the contra- dictions, while the information that analysis can provide is limited.

Direct represents the approach of not using effective expansion and gener- ating a new query directly. CoT represents the approach of using CoT Expansion. MPC represents the approach of using Missing Paragraph Completion Expansion. Effective expansion strategies significantly en- hance the performance of retrieval. As shown by Table 4, our proposed strategies surpass the baseline strategy, demonstrating their superiority in guiding the search direction by controlling the queries used for retrieval. The performance im- provement observed with the CoT underscores the significance of incorporating reasoning capabilities into iterative retrieval processes. Notably, the MPC strategy exhibits the best performance, which may be attributed to the extensive knowledge stored in recent LLMs. This confirms that utilizing both parametric and non-parametric information during the retrieval process can improve retrieval and gen- eration performance (Yu et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023). The pruning strategies ensure performance while reducing time cost. As shown by Table
