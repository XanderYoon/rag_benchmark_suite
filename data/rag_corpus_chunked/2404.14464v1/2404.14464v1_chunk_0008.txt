The paragraphs review block selects an action based on the question Q and paragraphs along the path. The block is designed to execute the following steps: (i) Judging whether the paragraphs are relevant to the question Q. Relevance means that paragraphs contain partial information to answer the question. (ii) Judging whether the paragraphs have enough information, which means that paragraphs contain all information to answer the question (iii) If it is not relevant, then action selection is [Reject] then stop search; if it is relevant but not enough, action selection is [Search] then generate a new query and retrieval with it; if it is relevant and enough, then action selection is [Accept] then stop search. Once LLM accepts a reasoning path, it will be asked to answer the original question Q based on all the documents on this reasoning path. This answer is called a brief analysis. The accepted reasoning path combined with the brief analysis form a piece of evidence. Utilizing the method above, we iteratively ex- ecute retrieval and review through the depth-first search until each reasoning path is either accepted, rejected, or reaches its maximum search depth. 3.3 Evidence Fusion The evidence pool contains some pieces of evi- dence. The QA reader will generate a response according to the evidence pool. We propose three simple methods for evidence fusion: Analysis-based Fusion: The reader generates a response only according to the brief analysis. Paragraph-Based Fusion: The reader
