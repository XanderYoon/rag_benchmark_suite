original documents with proper location and granularity. Fine-tuning on our crafted training data enables the model to effectively execute the task. In the single-candidate setup, where the model processes only the relevant document, fine-tuned models demonstrate substantial gains compared to zero- shot prompting a much larger model. On Wiki- VISA, the 7B variant achieves 54.2% bounding box accuracy and 65.2% answer accuracy, while on Paper-VISA, the corresponding scores reach 68.2% and 43.8%. Performance in the multi-candidate setting, which more closely mirrors real-world retrieval- augmented generation (RAG) systems, shows simi- lar trends. The 7B model achieves 41.6% bounding box accuracy and 51.1% answer accuracy when handling three candidate documents, including cases where no relevant document is present. This demonstrates the model’s capability to identify rel- evant sources among multiple documents while enabling fine-grained attribution. However, when comparing the multi-candidates, oracle in candi- dates setting, We can see the model facing chal- lenges when handling multiple candidates com- pared to just handling a single relevant document. E.g. on Wiki-VISA, bounding box accuracy for 7B model is 37.7% on average which is 17 points lower than the corresponding single candidate set- ting. Showing that visual source attribution among multi-candidates is much harder than just locating the source element in a single one.
