data combinations in the sin- gle candidate setting. It enables us to study the ef- fectiveness of out-of-domain transfer and augmen- tation. First, we highlight the challenges of zero- shot generalization in VISA. Training and evaluat- ing on in-domain achieves an effective bounding box accuracy, e.g. 54.2% on average for Wiki- VISA. However, significant performance drops are observed when models are tested on out-of-domain datasets. For instance, a model trained on Wiki- VISA achieves only 27.8% bounding box accuracy on Paper-VISA, while a model trained on Paper- VISA achieves near-zero performance (0.2%) on Wiki-VISA. This gap underscores the difficulty of transferring visual source attribution capabilities across datasets with differing document structures, layouts, and content modalities. Interestingly, Wiki- VISA appears to transfer better to Paper-VISA com- pared to the reverse. This may be because of the multi-page nature of Wiki-VISA, which provides richer training signals that generalize better to sim- pler single-page setting in Paper-VISA. FineWeb-VISA shows as a promising resource for training models with improved zero-shot capa- bilities. When trained on FineWeb-VISA alone, the model achieves 37.6% bounding box accu- racy on Wiki-VISA and 22.0% on Paper-VISA. Notably, FineWeb-VISA outperforms Wiki-VISA training on [>1] passage bbx accuracy for Wiki- VISA (57.3% vs. 50.1%), suggesting its effective- ness in handling long and complex document struc- tures. However, FineWeb-VISA does not perform as well on non-passage content, likely due to its training focus on passage-level targets. 6.2 Data Augmentation The results also demonstrate the benefits of aug- menting training data with FineWeb-VISA. On Wiki-VISA, combining Wiki and FineWeb train- ing data improves bounding box accuracy from 54.2% to 58.2% and improves performance on [>1] passages from 50.1% to 61.7%, indicating that FineWeb complements Wiki by enhancing the model’s ability to attribute evidence in multi-page contexts. For Paper-VISA, however, augmenting with FineWeb does
