mental results highlight the potential of VISA to bridge the gap between information retrieval and answer generation by offering finer-grained, visu- ally grounded evidence attribution. Moving for- ward, we hope VISA represents a pioneering step for more verifiable and user-friendly RAG systems. 8 Limitations While VISA demonstrates promising results for answer generation and content grounding in vision- based RAG systems, it has several limitations. First, it focuses on generating short answers, which may not suffice for scenarios requiring detailed or ex- planatory responses, highlighting the need for en- hancements in generating richer context. Second, it assumes answers are derived from a single, lo- calized region within a document, which limits its effectiveness for cases where evidence spans mul- tiple sections or modalities (e.g., combining text and tables). Third, while our evaluation spans web and medical scientific papers with various content modalities (e.g., passages, tables, figures), it does not fully capture the diversity of real-world doc- uments such as scanned or handwritten content. Additionally, as VISA aims to make it intuitive for users to verify answers, conducting user studies could further confirm its practical utility. 9 Acknowledgments We sincerely thank Xinyu Shi, Minghan Li, Jack Lin, Xinyu Zhang, and Yubo Wang for their in- valuable feedback and insightful suggestions.
