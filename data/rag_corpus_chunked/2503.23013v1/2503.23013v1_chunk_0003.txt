By assessing only the top result from each method with an LLM-based effectiveness scoring mechanism, we can efficiently determine which retrieval method performs better for a given query without the computational burden of evaluating multiple documents. This lightweight evaluation provides a strong signal for estimating relative retrieval strength for dynamic α calculation. Our contributions are four-fold: • We propose a query-adaptive framework that dynamically calibrates the weighting between sparse and dense retrieval methods, eliminating reliance on predetermined, static α values. • We introduce an LLM-based effectiveness scoring mechanism that evaluates re- trieval effectiveness based on the specific relationship between each query and the knowledge base, rather than on general query characteristics. • We demonstrate that evaluating only the top result from each retrieval method provides sufficient signal for effective weighting decisions, offering a significantly more cost-efficient approach to hybrid retrieval optimization. • We demonstrate through extensive experiments that DAT significantly outperforms fixed-weight hybrid approaches, particularly for queries where retrieval methods exhibit varying effectiveness. Our empirical results show that DAT consistently improves retrieval performance across various evaluation metrics, with particularly substantial gains on challenging queries where standard hybrid approaches struggle. Moreover, we demonstrate that our approach reduces the variance in performance across individual queries, providing more consistent user experiences. 2 Related Work Hybrid retrieval systems combine the complementary strengths of multiple retrieval meth- ods. BM25 (Robertson et al., 1994), the predominant sparse retrieval algorithm, calculates relevance based on term frequency and inverse document frequency, efficiently handling exact keyword matching. Meanwhile, dense retrieval approaches (Karpukhin et al., 2020) leverage vector embeddings to capture semantic relationships beyond lexical overlap. The effectiveness of combining sparse and dense methods has been
