query. We define the optimal weighting value as the α that produces the highest retrieval ranking for the ground truth paragraph pi given query qi. The results in Table 2 show that DAT variants achieve higher alpha selection accuracy than fixed weighting approaches on both datasets, with GPT-4o reaching 0.9234 accuracy on SQuAD and GPT-4o-mini achieving 0.9013 on DRCD compared to 0.8975 and 0.8623 for the Fixed Hybrid approach, respectively. The results in Table 3 demonstrate that our DAT approach consistently outperforms both single-method retrieval and fixed-weight hybrid retrieval across both datasets. For SQuAD, even the DAT variant using the small model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B) achieves significant improvements over the best fixed hybrid approach, with a ˜2% increase in Precision@1. Similarly for DRCD, all DAT variants provide notable improvements, with GPT-4o achieving a ˜3.3% increase in Precision@1. Interestingly, we observe that while dense retrieval performs relatively well on the SQuAD dataset, BM25 shows stronger performance on the DRCD dataset, suggesting different retrieval dynamics across datasets. Despite these differences, DAT effectively adapts to both scenarios by dynamically selecting appropriate alpha values.
