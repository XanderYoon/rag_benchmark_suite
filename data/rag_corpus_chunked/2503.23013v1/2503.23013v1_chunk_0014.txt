for SQuAD and GPT-4o-mini achieving 0.8056 for DRCD versus approximately 0.73 for the Fixed Hybrid approach on both datasets. This improved ability to dynamically select optimal weightings directly translates to enhanced retrieval performance shown in Table 5. The results on both hybrid-sensitive subsets reveal several important insights: 1. The performance gap between single-method retrieval and hybrid methods is sub- stantially wider on these subsets, highlighting the importance of effective weighting in challenging cases. 2. DAT consistently outperforms the fixed hybrid approach, with the best variant (GPT-4o) achieving a ˜7.5% improvement in Precision@1 for SQuAD and a ˜6.4% improvement for DRCD over fixed hybrid weighting. 3. Even the smaller model variants demonstrate significant improvements, with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B achieving a ˜5.4% improvement in Precision@1 for SQuAD and a ˜4.6% improvement for DRCD over fixed hybrid weighting. These findings confirm that our dynamic alpha tuning approach is particularly valuable for complex queries where different retrieval methods exhibit varying effectiveness, precisely the scenarios where intelligent weighting is most needed. 8 Preprint. Under review. 6 Scoring Mechanism Analysis To provide deeper insight into DAT’s effectiveness, we analyze how the LLM-based scoring mechanism evaluates retrieval quality and dynamically adjusts α values through represen- tative case studies from both datasets. 6.1 SQuAD Query Example For the SQuAD query “What gun did the Royal Navy start using?”, the correct answer mentions Britain’s 3.7-inch HAA gun. The Top-1 result from dense retriever returned: “By the early 20th century balloon, or airship, guns, for land and naval use were attracting attention. Various types of ammunition were proposed...” The Top-1 result from BM25 retriever returned: “AAA battalions were also used to help suppress ground targets. Their larger 90 mm M3 gun would prove... Also available to the Americans at the start of the war was the 120 mm M1 gun...” The LLM’s
