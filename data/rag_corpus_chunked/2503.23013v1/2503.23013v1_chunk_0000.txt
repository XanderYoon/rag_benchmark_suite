DAT: Dynamic Alpha T uning for Hybrid Retrieval in Retrieval-Augmented Generation Hsin-Ling Hsu National Chengchi University Taipei, Taiwan 112306092@nccu.edu.tw Jengnan Tzeng∗ National Chengchi University Taipei, Taiwan jengnan@math.nccu.edu.tw Abstract Hybrid retrieval techniques in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance information retrieval by combining dense and sparse (e.g., BM25-based) retrieval methods. However, existing approaches struggle with adaptability, as fixed weighting schemes fail to adjust to different queries. To address this, we propose DAT (Dynamic Alpha Tuning), a novel hybrid retrieval framework that dynamically balances dense retrieval and BM25 for each query. DAT leverages a large language model (LLM) to evaluate the effectiveness of the top-1 results from both retrieval methods, assigning an effectiveness score to each. It then calibrates the optimal weighting factor through effectiveness score normalization, ensuring a more adaptive and query-aware weighting between the two approaches. Empirical results show that DAT consistently significantly outperforms fixed-weighting hybrid retrieval methods across various evaluation metrics. Even on smaller models, DAT delivers strong performance, highlighting its efficiency and adaptability. 1 Introduction Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) (Lewis et al., 2020) systems have emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the factuality and reliability of large language model (LLM) outputs by grounding responses in external knowledge sources. At the core of effective RAG systems lies the retrieval component, which is responsible for identifying and surfacing the most relevant documents from a knowledge base in response to user queries. The quality of retrieval directly impacts the overall performance of RAG systems, making it a critical area for optimization. Hybrid retrieval (Ma et al., 2020; Sawarkar et al., 2024; Berntson, 2023) approaches combining sparse (e.g., BM25) and dense methods have demonstrated superior performance compared to either method alone. BM25 (Robertson et al., 1994) excels at precise keyword matching through term frequency calculations, while dense retrieval (Karpukhin et
