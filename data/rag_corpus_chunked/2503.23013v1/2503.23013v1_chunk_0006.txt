strategy fails to account for the varying nature of user queries, limiting retrieval effectiveness across diverse scenarios. 4 DAT To overcome the limitations of static weighting in hybrid retrieval, we introduce DAT, a query-adaptive framework that dynamically adjusts the retrieval weighting coefficient based on the effectiveness of each method for a given query. The central intuition is that different queries inherently favor different retrieval strategies—some require precise keyword overlap (favoring BM25), while others rely on semantic alignment (favoring dense retrieval). DAT harnesses the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to estimate the optimal weighting coefficient α(q) for each query at runtime. Unlike traditional approaches that depend on predefined heuristics or offline-tuned parameters, our method adapts on-the-fly to each query’s unique interaction with the knowledge base. Given a query q, we retrieve the top-1 result from both sparse and dense retrieval methods: dv,1 ∈ Ddense(q) and db,1 ∈ DBM25(q). These top-ranked documents are treated as represen- tative indicators of each method’s retrieval effectiveness for the specific query. This focused sampling strategy minimizes computational cost while providing sufficient signal to inform adaptive weighting decisions. 4.1 LLM-Based Retrieval Effectiveness Scoring A key component of DAT is the use of LLMs as evaluators of retrieval quality. We posit that LLMs, with their deep semantic understanding, can assess the relevance of a retrieved document to the original query and thereby estimate each retrieval method’s relative effectiveness. 4 Preprint. Under review. To formalize this, we define a scoring function S(q, d) = fLLM(q, d), which returns an effec- tiveness score in the discrete range {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}—with higher values indicating greater effectiveness. The scoring rubric is carefully designed to reflect retrieval effectiveness: • 5 points: Direct hit—the retrieved document directly answers the question. • 3–4 points: Good wrong result—the document is conceptually
