** Completely off - track --> 0 points ** - If the result is ** totally unrelated ** , it means the retrieval method is failing . --- ### ** Given Data :** - ** Question :** "{ question }" 11 Preprint. Under review. - ** dense retrieval Top1 Result :** "{ vector_r eference }" - ** BM25 retrieval Top1 Result :** "{ bm25_reference }" --- ### ** Output Format :** Return two integers separated by a space : - ** First number :** dense retrieval score . - ** Second number :** BM25 retrieval score . - Example output : 3 4 ( Vector : 3 , BM25 : 4) ** Do not output any other text .** B Limitations While our DAT framework demonstrates significant improvements over fixed-weight hybrid retrieval methods, several limitations warrant discussion. DAT’s dependence on LLM-based effectiveness scoring introduces computational overhead that may increase latency and cost in production environments, despite our efforts to mitigate this by only evaluating top-1 results. However, as large language models continue to evolve and computational hardware advances, we anticipate these efficiency constraints will gradually diminish, expanding the practical deployment scenarios for our approach. 12
