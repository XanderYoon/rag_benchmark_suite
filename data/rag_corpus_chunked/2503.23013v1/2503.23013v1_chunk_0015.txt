airship, guns, for land and naval use were attracting attention. Various types of ammunition were proposed...” The Top-1 result from BM25 retriever returned: “AAA battalions were also used to help suppress ground targets. Their larger 90 mm M3 gun would prove... Also available to the Americans at the start of the war was the 120 mm M1 gun...” The LLM’s reasoning process determined: • The dense result provides topical relevance to naval guns but lacks specificity about Royal Navy adoption. Score: 3/5. • The BM25 result focuses on American artillery unrelated to the Royal Navy. Score: 2/5. This yielded α = 3/(3 + 2) = 0.6, appropriately favoring the semantically-related dense result that was more likely to lead to relevant information. 6.2 DRCD Query Example For the DRCD query “ 水分子中的質子在高溫中與鋯進行無氧性氧化反應後什麼物質會產 生?” (What substance is produced when protons in water molecules react anaerobically with zirconium at high temperatures?), the Top-1 result from dense retriever returned: “氫 在氧化後會失去它的電子，形成氫陽離子。氫陽離子不含電子，其原子核通常只含一個質 子...” (When hydrogen is oxidized, it loses its electron and becomes a hydrogen ion...). The Top-1 result from BM25 retriever returned: “ 在無氧條件下，鐵和合成鋼會被水分子中的 質子緩慢氧化，而水則會還原成分子氫...” (Under anaerobic conditions, iron and steel are oxidized by protons in water molecules, producing molecular hydrogen...). The LLM evaluated: • The dense result explains hydrogen ions but lacks discussion of their reaction with zirconium. Score: 3/5. • The BM25 result discusses a reaction mechanism with iron that parallels what occurs with zirconium, correctly identifying hydrogen gas as the product. Score: 4/5. This produced α = 3/(3 + 4) = 0.43 (rounded to 0.4), appropriately weighting toward the more relevant result. These examples demonstrate how DAT’s scoring mechanism effectively balances retrieval methods based on result quality rather than relying on predefined query categories. By evaluating the specific relationship between each query and the retrieved contents, the system adapts to diverse
