us define CLIP-score as the similarity score based on CLIP embeddings. From the histogram, it is evident that (i) the CLIP-score between image-text pairs has limited range, e.g., about (0.13, 0.35), and (ii) the distribution of the CLIP- score for relevant and irrelevant statements has considerable overlap which means that such similarity score struggles to adequately distinguish between relevant and irrelevant pieces of data. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 3, the RS score on the same evaluation dataset effectively shifts the distribution, creating a clearer separation between relevant and irrelevant samples. In particular, the RS score (i) exploits the full output range Fig. 2. CLIP-score histogram. Fig. 3. RS score histogram. of (0, 1) and (ii) in comparison to the similarity score based on the CLIP, the two distributions for relevant and irrelevant samples based on RS are well separated. As a simple measure of separation one can consider the distance between the mean of relevant and irrelevant samples for CLIP-score and RS that are calculated as 0.03 and 0.41 for the distribution given in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, respectively, while the maximum separation between the mean of such scores that are limited in interval [0,1] is at most 1. A more suitable measure of separation between two discrete distribution is Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) which is calculated as 0.32 and 0.58 for CLIP-score and RS, respectively, with the upper bound 0.83 for scores that are limited in interval [0,1]. The threshold may be used on the value obtained by CLIP- score in order to make a binary classification of the statements into relevant/irrelevant. In order to easily interpret the perfor- mance of CLIP-score based on the different thresholds we plot the cumulative density function (cdf) of the distribution of the irrelevant samples depicted in Fig. 2 and 1-cdf
