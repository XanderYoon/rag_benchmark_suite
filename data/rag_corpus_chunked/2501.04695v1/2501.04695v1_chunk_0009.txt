for initial retrieval, they often fall short in distinguishing between truly relevant and irrelevant entries. One may directly use RS score to enhance retrieval process. However, this would elongate the retrieval by a factor of ×35. To address this, we propose the following re-ranking mechanism. For selecting up-to- k entries, we first retrieve a larger candidate set of size l, l > k , using the computationally efficient CLIP-score. These l candidates are then re-ranked based on their RS scores, which incorporate the relevance of each candidate to the query more precisely. Finally, the up- to-k entries from the re-ranked list are selected as the final retrieved entries. Our proposed up-to-k algorithm works as follows. From the list of l candidates, we eliminate the entries with RS below threshold τlo and keep the entries with RS above τhi. Let τ be the median of the RS for the rest of the entries. We discard the entries below τ and keep the entries above τ. If the number of kept entries exceeds k, we select k entries with highest RS, otherwise we select only the kept entries. This adaptive re-ranking method not only improves the alignment of retrieved entries with the user query but also reduces the likelihood of irrelevant data that could cause hallucinations in downstream tasks. By combining the time efficiency of CLIP for fast initial retrieval with enhanced capability of RS in measuring the relevancy, our approach proposes a balance between computational complexity and retrieval quality. Our experimental results illustrates significant enhancement not only in retrieval but also in the accuracy of the final output generated by multi-modal RAG systems. V.
