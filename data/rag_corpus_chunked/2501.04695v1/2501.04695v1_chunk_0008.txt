[0,1]. The threshold may be used on the value obtained by CLIP- score in order to make a binary classification of the statements into relevant/irrelevant. In order to easily interpret the perfor- mance of CLIP-score based on the different thresholds we plot the cumulative density function (cdf) of the distribution of the irrelevant samples depicted in Fig. 2 and 1-cdf of the distribution of the relevant samples as illustrated in Fig. 4. By selecting a threshold value on the CLIP-score in the horizontal axis, one can easily see the probability of correct labeling of Fig. 4. CDF for relevant (irrelevant) samples in CS-score. Fig. 5. CDF for relevant (irrelevant) samples in RS score. positive and negative statements by reading the corresponding values of the plotted curves. The overall accuracy is also the average between these two curves denoted by the legend ‘accuracy’. It is observed that the maximum accuracy for the CLIP-score on the evaluated dataset is about 0.65 occurring at the threshold of about 0.2. Similarly, we plot the cdf and 1-cdf of the distributions of the irrelevant and relevant samples, respectively, for the RS in Fig. 5. By selecting an optimized threshold, RS achieves sig- nificantly higher accuracy of about 0.88 occurring at threshold 0.75. IV. R E-RANKING WITH RS S CORE In multi-modal RAG systems, the retrieval process plays a critical role in ensuring that selected data aligns with the user query. While CLIP-based methods are efficient for initial retrieval, they often fall short in distinguishing between truly relevant and irrelevant entries. One may directly use RS score to enhance retrieval process. However, this would elongate the retrieval by a factor of ×35. To address this, we propose the following re-ranking mechanism. For selecting up-to- k entries, we first retrieve a larger candidate set of size l,
