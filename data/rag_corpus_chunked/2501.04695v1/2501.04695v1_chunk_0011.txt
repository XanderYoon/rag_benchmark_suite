1.27 times slower retrieval process, respectively. Next, we compare the generated output performance of different RAG implementations, i.e., four RAG schemes with combinations of different VLMs and LLMs as well as a RAG scheme directly based on GPT-4o that processes multi-modal context, e.g., multiple images, and text query simultaneously. For each RAG implementation, we use 4 retrieval methods: top-k selection for k = 5 using CLIP-large, up-to- k selection directly using RS, and up-to- k selection using re-ranking with Fig. 6. RAG retrieval relevancy performance. Fig. 7. RAG generated output performance. l = 10 , 20. We use τlo = 0 .3 and τhi = 0 .75 for the up- to-k algorithm. The performance of the generated output is measured in terms of confidence score that is calculated as the geometric mean of CS and RS. The confidence score incorporates both the relevancy of the retrieved context and accuracy of the output in the view of the context in a single measure. It is important to note that a RAG may generate an output that is correct within the selected context, i.e., CS is high, but the retrieved context is not relevant, i.e., RS is low, hence, the output may not contain the answer to the user query. Fig. 7 indicates that applying RS directly or through re- ranking improves response quality across all evaluated RAG structures. VI. C ONCLUSION We presented a retrieval process for RAG comprising re- ranking and up-to- k selection method. Our proposed solution (i) reduces the hallucinations by selecting more relevant entries from the knowledge-base, and (ii) improves the relevancy of the output to the query. REFERENCES [1] P.
