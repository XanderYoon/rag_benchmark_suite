A Data Generation Details A.1 Implicit Query Dataset For our experiments, we created a synthetic dataset to simulate realistic interactions across various ap- plications commonly found with digital assistants. The dataset is structured to encompass a diverse range of contexts, representing different synthetic user activities and interactions. Data Points: A total of 791 unique personas were synthesized, covering seven key applications: Mail, Calendar, Google, Music, Reminders, Notes, and Phone Calls. The final dataset contained 4,338 train and 936 test data points. Generation Method: We utilized GPT-4 to gen- erate the data. We ensured high diversity in the dataset is met through manual inspection, this is essential to accurately reflect a wide range of syn- thetic user personalities and interaction patterns. Data Representation: Each data point in the dataset contains multiple contextual information fields, relevant to the specific application and syn- thetic user’s activity. An example of persona in JSON format is shown in Figure 3. Figure 3: Snippet of a persona Table 3 shows the distribution of context items per application in our dataset.
