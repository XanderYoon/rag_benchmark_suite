(AST) matching strategy to compute plan accuracy. A hallucination is defined as a plan generated using an imaginary tool. 4 Results 4.1 Context Retrieval Consistent with expectations, vector-based search surpasses text-based search, as shown in Table 1. Nevertheless, both approaches struggle to retrieve relevant context for under-specified queries. Fine- tuned semantic search and CoT augmentation with pre-trained semantic search both significantly en- hance retrieval performance. Notably, when fine- tuning is employed, CoT augmentation yields only marginal gains, suggesting that comparable im- Table 1: A comparison of various Context Retrieval methods using Recall@K and NDCG@K metrics. The context-seeking query is used as input to perform a federated search across different context stores, after which semantic search or ranking is applied.

Our proposed approach utilizing LambdaMART with RRF outperforms both fine-tuned semantic search and CoT augmentation. Additionally, we ob- serve that for fine-tuned methods, both Recall@K and NDCG@K increase with K, whereas for pre- trained methods, NDCG@K decreases with an in- crease in K and Recall@K. 4.2 Tool Retrieval Figure 2 illustrates the performance of tool retrieval using semantic search. Incorporating relevant con- text into tool retrieval consistently yields substan- tial gains across various K-values. 4.3 Planner To establish the planner’s lower bound, we remove the retrieval step, while the upper bound is set by directly utilizing context and/or
