—Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Hallucina- tion, Large Language Models, Open Domain Question Answering I. I NTRODUCTION Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a leading approach for implementing question-answering sys- tems that require intensive domain-specific knowledge [1]. This method allows for the utilization of customized datasets to generate answers, grounded in the information provided by those datasets. However, the effectiveness of the retrieval component within RAG pipelines is critical, as it directly influences the reliability and quality of the generated outputs [2], [3]. In efforts to enhance the quality of the retrieval component in RAG pipelines, research has demonstrated that transforming the user’s input query into varying levels of abstraction before conducting the document search can significantly improve the relevance of the retrieved data. Several methods have been proposed, including query expansion into multi-query searches, chain of verification [4], [5], pseudo-context search 1The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/heydaari/CAG [6] and query transformation [7], [8], [9], [10]. These ap- proaches contribute to more accurate and effective retrieval of information. Despite ongoing efforts to develop more reliable retrieval methods for extracting relevant data chunks, many question- answering systems do not solely rely on local or domain- specific datasets for answering user queries. In addition to domain-specific user queries, many input queries do not necessitate retrieval from local datasets, which reduces the scalability and reliability of question-answering systems [11]. To tackle this limitation, retrieval methods based on query classification and routing mechanisms have proven effective in enhancing retrieval accuracy by directing the search toward a set of documents closely related to the user’s query [10]. However, in our study, we demonstrate that even with semantic routing, the probability of retrieving irrelevant information remains non-negligible, particularly when dealing with a broad domain of potential queries.
