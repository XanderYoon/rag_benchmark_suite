in enhancing retrieval accuracy by directing the search toward a set of documents closely related to the user’s query [10]. However, in our study, we demonstrate that even with semantic routing, the probability of retrieving irrelevant information remains non-negligible, particularly when dealing with a broad domain of potential queries. Due to the inherently local search mechanism of Retrieval- Augmented Generation (RAG) systems [1], [12], even for queries that are largely irrelevant, the pipeline will still return a set number of passages. While existing research has made strides in addressing the challenge of imperfect data retrieval [11], [13], [14], the issue of broad-domain question answering in RAG systems has received relatively little attention. Many queries submitted to RAG-enhanced question- answering (QA) systems do not require data retrieval, such as daily conversations, general knowledge questions, or questions that large language models (LLMs) themselves can answer using their internal knowledge [10], [11], [15], [16]. Retrieving passages for all input queries, especially in these cases, can significantly diminish the retrieval precision [11], [16] and the context relevancy [17], often rendering them entirely irrelevant. To address this issue, we propose a novel context-aware gate architecture for RAG-enhanced systems which is highly scalable of dynamically routing the LLM input prompt to increase the quality of pipeline outputs. For better comprehension of our work, we highlight three main contributions in this study: • Context Awareness Gate (CAG) : We introduce a novel gate architecture that significantly broadens the domain arXiv:2411.16133v2 [cs.LG] 6 Jan 2025 accessibility of RAG systems. CAG leverages both query transformation and dynamic prompting to enhance the reliability of RAG pipelines in both open-domain and closed-domain question answering tasks. • Vector Candidates (VC) : We propose a statistical se- mantic analysis algorithm that improves semantic search and routing by utilizing the concept of pseudo-queries and
