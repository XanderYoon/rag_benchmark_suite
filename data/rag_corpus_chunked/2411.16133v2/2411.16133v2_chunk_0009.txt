in Table I. As demonstrated in Table I, over 95% of positive context- question pairs exhibit a cosine similarity greater than 0.55, while more than 95% of negative context-query pairs have a cosine similarity lower than 0.21. The median value for the positive set exceeds 0.71, whereas the median for the negative set is below 0.04. Although the maximum value of the negative set is higher than the minimum value of the positive set, the density of the positive distribution is greater than that of the negative distribution approximately 98.7% of the time. These statistics provide a comprehensive understanding that, by utilizing these metrics as a policy, we can develop TABLE I STATISTICAL ANALYSIS ON CRSB Policy Positive Negative Minimum 0.110 -0.193 5th Percentile 0.554 -0.052 1st Quartile 0.662 -0.000 Mean 0.705 0.047 Median 0.716 0.039 3rd Quartile 0.762 0.086 95th Percentile 0.836 0.219 Maximum 0.912 0.654 a statistical method that is highly effective in classifying user queries to establish dynamic prompts, as discussed in previous sections. Due to the algebraic nature of our method, we have in- tegrated advanced high-performance techniques for parallel computing and accelerated linear algebra through the JAX framework [24]. Leveraging JAX’s ability to handle automatic differentiation and just-in-time compilation (JIT) seamlessly, we are able to optimize the underlying computations for both CPU and GPU architectures. This not only allows for faster execution but also ensures scalability across large datasets and complex models. Our approach significantly improves the efficiency in computing the distributions of the dataset, offering a more streamlined and scalable solution for high- dimensional data analysis. V. R ESULTS To evaluate the capabilities and performance of the Context Awareness Gate (CAG), we applied this architecture to the SQuAD dataset [25] and our proposed benchmark, CRSB. We implemented an open-domain question-answering pipeline to assess the
