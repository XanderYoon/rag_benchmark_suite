to evaluate artist-related questions in text-only MQA tasks, addressing a gap in existing evaluations. 2. MUSIC QUESTION ANSWERING Question Answering (QA) refers to the task of providing an appropriate answer to a given question, which is one of the Information Retrieval (IR) tasks [6]. The task is typically framed as retrieving relevant information from a collection of documents or knowledge sources to answer fact-based questions. Open-domain QA involves answer- ing questions from a vast and varied set of topics using a large collection of general knowledge documents [7, 8]. In contrast, domain-specific QA targets specialized fields such as medicine [9], law [10], or music [11–14], where both the document set and the questions are confined to that domain. In this work, we define the MQA task as the problem of providing accurate and relevant answers to music-related questions by leveraging domain-specific musical knowledge. Several recent studies have introduced music-related benchmarks to evaluate LLM performance. MuChoMu- sic [11] features 1,187 audio-based multiple-choice ques- tions that assess both musical knowledge and reasoning capabilities. MusicTheoryBench [12] contains 372 expert- validated questions designed to evaluate advanced music knowledge and reasoning skills. TrustMus [13] comprises 400 questions across four domains— People, Instruments and Technology, Genres, F orms, and Theory, and Culture and History—all derived from The Grove Dictionary On- line [15]. ZIQI-Eval [14] presents a comprehensive evalu- ation framework consisting of 14,000 comprehension tasks that span 10 major topics and 56 subtopics, encompassing a broad spectrum of music-related knowledge. A significant shortcoming of existing benchmarks is their inadequate representation of rich metadata about tracks, artists, and albums—information crucial for every- day music listening contexts. Current text-only QA bench- marks inadequately address common music information needs, lacking comprehensive coverage of details that lis- teners frequently seek: complete discographies, artist col- laboration networks, creative evolution across albums,
