the small “fish- ing net”) andchunk_delete for context refinement and information overload prevention. 3.2.2 Multi-Turn Retrieval Process The iterative retrieval process operates within a configurable maximum turn limit (typically set to 5 turns) to balance thoroughness with efficiency. In each turn, the system performs the following steps: 1.Reasoning Phase: The model analyzes the current context, including the original query and all previously retrieved information, to determine if additional retrieval is necessary. 2.Query Formulation: If retrieval is deemed necessary, the model generates a focused search query designed to address specific information gaps identified during reasoning. 3.Retrieval Execution: The system exe- cutes the chunk_search function against the vector database to identify relevant document chunks. The function accepts the rewritten query and returns the top-k most relevant document chunks (k= 5 ) with metadata and text content. 4.Context Integration: Retrieved chunks are integrated into the system context, providing the model with additional information for subsequent reasoning. 5.Iteration Decision: The model determines whether to continue searching or provide a final answer based on the accumulated information. 3.2.3 Key Optimization Components Our complete iterative system incorporates several critical optimization mechanisms that address the inherent challenges of agentic retrieval: Fallback Search Mechanism: To mitigate the risk of query drift and ensure comprehensive cov- erage, the system implements a strategic fallback mechanism during the initial retrieval phase. When the model performs its first chunk_search oper- ation, the system automatically executes an addi- tional retrieval using the original user query in par- allel to the model’s reformulated query. This dual- retrieval approach is specifically applied only to the first turn to provide a strong foundation for sub- sequent iterations—ensuring the model starts with a good baseline of relevant information from the original query while still benefiting from its own query reformulation. Adaptive Context Management: The system incorporates the
