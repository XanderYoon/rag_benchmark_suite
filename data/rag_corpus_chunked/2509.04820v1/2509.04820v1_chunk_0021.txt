size, while the iterative strategy relies on focused, incremental information gathering with active con- text management. Combining these approaches requires more sophisticated mechanisms to balance context size, relevance filtering, and retrieval moti- vation—an area for future research. 5 Conclusion In this paper, we explored two strategies, namely “casting a bigger net” and “casting a small net mul- tiple times”, supported by our carefully designed retrieval and reasoning modules. Both strategies demonstrated significant improvements, achieving over+10%performance gains compared with basic RAG baselines when applied to complex govern- ment documents. Our findings highlight the impor- tance of adopting adaptive retrieval and iterative reasoning to better handle lengthy, heterogeneous government texts.
