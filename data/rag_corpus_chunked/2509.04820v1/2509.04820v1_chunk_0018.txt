The original DeepSeek results are mostly lower than Qwen3 due to dozens of questions being rejected, so we report the relative percentage of correct answers based on the questions DeepSeek can generate results for, noted as DeepSeek∗ in grey color. 4.3.2 Applications on Different LLMs As we can observe in Table 5, no matter based on Qwen3(Yang et al., 2025a) orDeepSeek-R1(Guo et al., 2025), our agentic iterative strategy can gen- erally achieve better results than basic RAG, and this may be highly due to the more frequent re- trieval: as we observe,Agentic (Qwen3)increases retrieval by +59%, andAgentic (DeepSeek)by +97%. Moreover, in the complex questions L3 and L4, we observe twice higher frequency of retrieval. However, due to the high-sensitivity filter- ing and security protocol of DeepSeek-R1, a lot of questions are being rejected, resulting worse performance than Qwen3(as shown inAgentic (DeepSeek)); We exclude those questions and re- 80828486889092 12k16k20k24k28k Score Token Budgets for Token-Constrained Top-Kmaxretriever Token-Constrained, No Chunk DeleteToken-Constrained + Chunk DeleteIterative StrategyOne-shot Strategy Figure 5: Performance comparison of combined strate- gies with different configurations. calculate the relative accuracy rate asAgentic (DeepSeek∗), we can see that among the questions DeepSeekis allowed to answer, the performance is very promising. Yet, this still supports our decision of deployment based onQwen3. 4.4 Combine both? “Cast A Big Net Multi-Times” Overviewing the two strategies in Table 1 and Table 4, we can see that “different paths lead to the same goal”, both strategies, either “cast a bigger net” or “cast a small net multi-times”, reach the similar accuracy of 90% - 91%.
