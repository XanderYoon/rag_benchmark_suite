during relevance evaluation. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the One-SHOT strat- egy across LLMs with different sizes and reasoning capabilities. They also highlight the trade-off be- tween reasoning complexity and latency, suggest- ing that careful system design is needed to balance performance gains and computational efficiency. 4.3 Results on Iterative Retrieval Strategy 4.3.1 Ablation studies We evaluated our iterative retrieval approach through a series of ablation studies, progressively building from a basic agentic system to our com- plete framework described in Section 3.2. Our experiments reveal several key insights about the challenges and opportunities in multi-turn retrieval systems. As shown in Table 4, theBasic Agen- tic (Multi-turn)can autonomously decide when and what to search across multiple turns, but it shows mixed results: while complex retrieval tasks (L3 and L4) benefit from the iterative approach, simpler questions (L1 and L2) experience slight performance degradation. This counterintuitive re- sult reveals a critical challenge in agentic retrieval: query drift, where the model’s autonomous query reformulation may deviate from the user’s original intent, particularly for straightforward questions where the initial query is already well-formed. For example, when given the original query "I left my previous company 3 years ago, can I still recover my housing fund contributions?", the model might reformulate it as "housing fund withdrawal time limit regulations" and then further drift to "housing fund withdrawal conditions for resigned employ- ees". This reformulation fundamentally changes the intent from recovering/reclaiming contributions to asking about withdrawal procedures, leading to irrelevant retrieval results. + Fallback Search benefits easy QAs more, i.e., L1 and L2 without retrival reasoning need, vul- nerable to query drift. Fallback search performs parallel retrieval using both the model’s reformu- lated query and the original user query during the Method L1 L2 L3 L4 Avg Basic RAG (Top-5) 89.5 88.5
