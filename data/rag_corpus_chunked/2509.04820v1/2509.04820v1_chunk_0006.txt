2024; Zhang et al.). Recent progress in RAG has moved beyond static, rule-based pipelines toward more dynamic, decision-driven systems broadly known asAgentic RAG. These systems embed retrieval decisions into the model’s reasoning flow, enabling LLMs to actively determine when and how to inter- act with external tools during generation. A growing body of work has demonstrated the effectiveness of prompting large models to au- tonomously invoke tools, reformulate queries, or break down complex questions. For instance, meth- ods like ReAct (Yao et al., 2023), Self-Ask (Press et al., 2023), and Search-o1 (Li et al., 2025a) allow models to interleave generation with retrieval by identifying knowledge gaps and issuing targeted queries. Built-in function calling APIs (Eleti et al., 2023) further support structured tool use in models like GPT and Gemini. Beyond prompting, other approaches train mod- els to improve their retrieval capabilities through learning signals. DeepRetrieval (Jiang et al., 2025), Search-R1 (Jin et al., 2025a), and ReZero (Dao and Le, 2025) integrate retrieval into the learning loop, optimizing search behaviors with reinforce- ment signals. More advanced systems like Deep- Researcher (Zheng et al., 2025) extend this idea to open-domain web environments, encouraging mod- els to reason, search, and synthesize in a tightly coupled loop. 3 Methodology This section will give the details on how we achieve the two strategies. 3.1 One-SHOT Strategy: “Casting A Bigger Net!” Our One-SHOT (all capital to infer the bigger net) retrieval strategy implements a token-constrained RAG framework designed to maximize recall RetrievingQuery Retain as many relevant chunks as possible.
