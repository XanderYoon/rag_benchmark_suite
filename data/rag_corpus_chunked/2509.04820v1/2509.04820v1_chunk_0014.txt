However, its effect is more moderate com- pared to the rule-basedChunk Filter, possibly due to the trade-off between precision and recall intro- duced by aggressive semantic cropping. Combin- ingChunk FilterandChunk Croppingyields mixed results, suggesting that their benefits are not strictly additive and require careful integration. Overall, these results demonstrate that optimiz- ing evidence selection through both token budget- ing and relevance refinement is crucial for enhanc- ing RAG performance in complex QA scenarios. 4.2.2 Chunk Retention Analysis To better understand how the One-SHOT pipeline refines evidence through multi-stage processing, we analyze thechunk retention ratioat each stage: after the initial retrieval (Token-Constrained Top- Kmax), after applying the rule-basedChunk Fil- ter, and finally after applying LLM-basedChunk Cropping. The results in Table 2 show that chunk retention varies across QA difficulty levels, with L2 consistently yielding the lowest retention. Both Chunk FilterandChunk Croppingreduce chunk volume, with the latter being slightly more aggres- sive across all levels. Interestingly, L1 and L4 retain more chunks after refinement, suggesting that simple factoid queries (L1) and domain-spe- cific regulatory queries (L4) allow clearer chunk-to- query alignment. When combined, the two meth- ods further reduce context size while maintaining high relevance, confirming that structured and se- mantic filtering are complementary in eliminating irrelevant or low-utility content, and that refinement sensitivity varies by question type.
