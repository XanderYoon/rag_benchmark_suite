Are large language models good statisticians?arXiv preprint arXiv:2406.07815. A Query Drift To illustrate the query drift phenomenon discussed in Section 4.3, we provide a concrete example here: Original User Query:"I have been away from my previous company for 3 years. Can I still re- cover my housing provident fund contributions?" Model-Reformulated Query:"Regulations on housing provident fund withdrawal time limits after resignation" Analysis:The original query seeks information about recovering or reclaiming housing provident fund contributions from a previous employer after a 3-year gap. However, the model’s autonomous reformulation shifts the focus to withdrawal regula- tions and time limits, fundamentally changing the intent from recovery/reclaim to
