Each row builds incrementally on the previous configuration. 4.2 Results on One-SHOT Strategy 4.2.1 Ablation studies We first conduct ablation studies on the One-SHOT retrieval strategy to evaluate the impact of each opti- mization component, as shown in Table 1. Starting from the baselineBasic RAG (Top-5), ourToken- Constrained Top-Kmax strategy brings a notable improvement by relaxing the fixed top-k constraint and retrieving more relevant content within a to- ken budget. This approach performs particularly well on L3 and L4 tasks, which demand deeper reasoning and broader evidence coverage. With the addition ofChunk Filter, we achieve the highest overall performance (91.0% average), amounting to a +10.0% gain over the baseline. This confirms the effectiveness of combining token-based recall expansion with relevance-aware filtering. Adding theChunk Filterbefore reaching the to- ken budgets further boosts performance, achieving the best overall result (91.0% average). The largest gains appear on L3 (+14.0%) and L4 (+19.0%), where filtering irrelevant chunks mitigates noise from large retrieval sets and allows the model to focus on high-value evidence. TheChunk Crop- pingfurther improves performance by removing noisy chunks through LLM-based semantic judg- ments. However, its effect is more moderate com- pared to the rule-basedChunk Filter, possibly due to the trade-off between precision and recall intro- duced by aggressive semantic cropping. Combin- ingChunk FilterandChunk Croppingyields mixed results, suggesting that their benefits are not strictly additive and require careful integration. Overall, these results demonstrate that optimiz- ing evidence selection through both token budget- ing and
