cor- pus of over 40,000 real-world government docu- ments. Specifically, the questions are categorized into four levels (ranging from Level 1 to Level 4) based on two key criteria: whether retrieval re- quires reasoning and whether answering requires reasoning. We ensure that all answers are retriev- able from the original document corpus. Figure 4 illustrates the difference between each level.

Basic RAG Setting. Our baseline system em- ploys traditional single-turn retrieval with a fixed Top-5 strategy. This basic RAG approach retrieves the top-5 most relevant document chunks based on vector similarity and provides them to the language model for answer generation without any iterative refinement or optimization mechanisms. All ex- periments are conducted using Qwen3-32B as the language model. Evaluation Setting. We employ an LLM-as- a-judge evaluation framework to assess answer quality across multiple dimensions including fac- tual accuracy, completeness, and relevance. We adopt SenseChat-5 to perform answer evaluation. The evaluation scores are normalized to a 0-100 scale for consistent comparison across different approaches.
