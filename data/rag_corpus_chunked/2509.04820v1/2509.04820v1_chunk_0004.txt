the ability to decompose the com- plex question (generation reasoning), and (2) the ability to retrieve multiple cues (retrieval reason- ing). To systematically evaluate the performance of traditional RAG systems and our two proposed strategies on government documents, we design a benchmark that categorizes questions into four levels based on whether generation reasoning and retrieval reasoning are required. This paper offers valuable insights (underlined) through extensive experiments on real-world gov- ernment documents, which we believe are highly beneficial for applications in legal and regulatory domains. The resulting RAG system has been con- tinuously deployed in practice and serving various clients for over two years. 2 Related Works 2.1 Basic RAG Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) was in- troduced to overcome the static knowledge limi- tations of LLMs by integrating external retrieval mechanisms during inference (Chen et al., 2024; Gao et al., 2023). Naive RAG methods represent the earliest implementations, typically using sparse retrieval techniques like BM25 (Robertson et al., 2009) to fetch documents based on keyword over- lap (Ma et al., 2023). While efficient for simple factoid queries, these approaches offered limited semantic understanding, thus often retrieving noisy or redundant content and failing to reason across multiple sources. The emergence of Advanced RAG and Modular RAG was aimed at addressing key limitations of the Naive RAG, particularly in terms of retrieval preci- sion, information integration, and system flexibil- ity (Gao et al., 2023). Advanced RAG improves re- trieval quality through techniques such as dense se- mantic matching, re-ranking, and multi-hop query- ing, while also introducing refined indexing strate- gies like fine-grained chunking and metadata-aware retrieval. Modular RAG rethinks the Naive RAG by breaking down the end-to-end process of indexing, retrieval, and generation into discrete, configurable modules. This design allows for greater architec- tural flexibility and enables system developers to incorporate diverse techniques into
