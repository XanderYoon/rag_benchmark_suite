to investigate the source of this improvement, we compared these meta-learners to baselines which used the same model weights for all queries, ﬁnding that our best-performing meta-learners also signiﬁcantly outperformed these “ﬁxed alpha” baselines. Finally, we consider a per-query oracle and ﬁnd that it sub- stantially improves over our meta-learning methods, demonstrating that there is room for improvement in future work. 6 Acknowledgements We gratefully acknowledge the support of NVIDIA Corporation with the dona- tion of a Titan X Pascal GPU used in this research. 7 KNRM+BM25, PACRR+KNRM, DeepTileBar+KNRM, PACRR+BM25, and Con- vKNRM+BM25 have alphas between 0.3-0.7 for more than 50% of queries 8 DTB+BM25 (favors DTB), PACRR+CoKNRM (favors CoKNRM), CoKNRM+KNRM (favors CoKNRM), PACRR+DTB (favors PACRR), and CoKNRM+DTB (favors DTB) Investigating Retrieval Method Selection 13 References 1.
