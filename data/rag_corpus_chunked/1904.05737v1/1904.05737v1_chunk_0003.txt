(2) an evaluation of the proposed approach against the base models themselves; and (3) an analysis of the weights given to the meta-learner’s features and the model weights predicted by the meta-learner. 2 Related Work Instance level meta learning, as deﬁned in [2], refers to the task of selecting the best algorithm or appropriately combining a pool of algorithms for every instance in a dataset. Recent work has considered instance level meta learning in the context of recommender systems. Collins et al. [2] trained a meta-learner to select the best recommendation algorithm from a pool for each instance by predicting the error for each model. At test time they perform recommendations by selecting the meta-learner with the lowest predicted error for a given instance. Their analysis showed that an oracle’s RMSE was over 25% higher than the best RMSE obtained by a single model, motivating us to explore meta learning for ad- hoc information retrieval. In the context of ad-hoc information retrieval, instance Investigating Retrieval Method Selection 3 level meta learning shares some similarities with query performance prediction, learning to rank, and federated search. Query Performance Prediction. Query performance prediction (QPP) is the task of predicting a model’s retrieval performance on a given query. [9] QPP has applications for tasks like choose performance sensitive parameters for early stage retrieval [17] and performing selective query expansion. [36] QPP tech- niques can be broadly categorized into two types: pre-retrieval and post retrieval approaches. Pre-retrieval approaches use linguistic features of the query as well as other features that can be computed without computing relevance scores for the collection. As a result, the pre-retrieval approaches are usually more eﬃcient. Mothe et al. [20] use linguistic features, such as part of speech tags and polysemy information obtained from Wordnet, to predict query diﬃculty. They found
