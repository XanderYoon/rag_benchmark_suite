We consider algorithm selection in the context of ad-hoc in- formation retrieval. Given a query and a pair of retrieval methods, we propose a meta-learner that predicts how to combine the methods’ rele- vance scores into an overall relevance score. Inspired by neural models’ diﬀerent properties with regard to IR axioms, these predictions are based on features that quantify axiom-related properties of the query and its top ranked documents. We conduct an evaluation on TREC Web Track data and ﬁnd that the meta-learner often signiﬁcantly improves over the individual methods. Finally, we conduct feature and query weight analyses to investigate the meta-learner’s behavior.

Work proposing IR axioms [6,31] has high- lighted behaviors that help to make a ranking method successful. The axioms describe properties that an ideal retrieval function should satisfy. We observe that diﬀerent queries often have diﬀerent retrieval needs and hence the impor- tance of a particular axiom can vary with the query. For example, for the query New York Tourism , capturing the proximity between the terms New and York is important. On the other hand, for the query Bidgely Data Science Company , the occurrence of Bidgely is most important, and documents talking about a diﬀerent Data Science Company are unlikely to be relevant. Thus, for the latter query, we would like a retrieval function to weight the occurrence of rare uni- grams higher
