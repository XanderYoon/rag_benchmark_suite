Signiﬁcance tests were conducted using a two-tailed paired Student’s t-test. Uppercase or low- ercase characters in brackets indicate statistical signiﬁcance with p < 0.05 or p < 0.10, respectively, over the BM25 (B/b), PACRR (P/p), KNRM (K/k), ConvKNRM (C/c), DeepTileBar (D/d) and corresponding ﬁxed alpha (F/f) baselines. Comparisons were made only between the ranking methods combined, the corresponding ﬁxed alpha baseline, and BM25. Investigating Retrieval Method Selection 9 outperform the neural IR baselines in terms of nDCG the majority of the time. The meta-learners that include ConvKNRM consistently perform best. While the performance of the meta-learners and the ﬁxed alpha baselines are often similar, the ConvKNRM+BM25 and ConvKNRM+KNRM meta-learners perform signiﬁcantly better than the corresponding ﬁxed alpha baselines across all metrics. This provides evidence that retrieval performance can be improved with per-query algorithm selection, and the oracle results indicate that all meta- learners could be further improved. The oracle’s performance is generally better when the two models being considered have diﬀerent characteristics. Combining unigram and n-gram models gives better performance than combining two n- gram models. For example, ConvKNRM+KNRM and ConvKNRM+BM25 per- form better than ConvKNRM+PACRR and ConvKNRM+DeepTileBar despite the fact that PACRR outperforms BM25. The ranking of the meta-learning methods is similar to the ranking of the oracles, suggesting that our meta- learner’s features are robust to the choice of models being combined.
