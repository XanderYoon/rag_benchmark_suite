2.3. Prompt engineering for similarity search case The usage of a generative model to retrieve similarity scores between pairs of sentences from the BIOSSES dataset requires a suitable prompt, i.e. a set of clear instructions enabling the model to perform the task as accurately as possible. Memmert et al., 2024 investigated the effects of six prompt engineering techniques to generate ideas for an exemplary scenario, highlighting the impact of the used prompting technique to retrieve the expected result. In the context of this study, the prompt is actually divided into two categories : thesystem prompt and the user prompt . The system prompt corresponds to the general instructions: it gives the context for the execution of the conversational chain build from the generative model. In the context of this research, the system prompt also includes training examples extracted from the train dataset to give the model a better understanding of how similarity scores are determined. Thegpt-3.5-turbo model has been used, but as mentioned by Salinas-Navarro et al., 2024, many other commercial (Bard, Claude, Jurassic, etc.) or open-source (Alpaca, BLOOM, Dolly, Llama 2, etc.) generative models are already available and could have been used for this study. 1 Comparing the result accuracy across these different generative models is not the purpose of this article but could be a subject of future researches. The system promptis defined as follows: You are a helpful assistant who helps retrieve similarity scores between two sentences. You will find below some examples to help you determine this similarity score with the best accuracy: ... The proposed method allows then to add directly after this prompt a set of examples extracted from the training dataset to be included in thesystem prompt. It is actually not always relevant to integrate the largest possible number of examples since the
