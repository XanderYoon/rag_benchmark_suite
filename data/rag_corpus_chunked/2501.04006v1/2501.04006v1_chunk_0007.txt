the generative model. Since the similarity score can be further processed only if the right formalism has been delivered, it is important to restrict the model’s freedom regarding the expected form of results. The words always,strictly, and only are precisely employed on that purpose. 2.4. Implementation of the conversational chain The conversational chain can easily be set up using a completion chat functiontaking as arguments thesystem prompt and the user prompt defined in the previous paragraph, and as well the generative model for which the temperature parameter must be set up. The impact of this temperature parameter on the result accuracy is analysed in detail in the paragraph 3.1. The answer provided by the generative model will then be processed using regular expression operators (regex) and converted to decimal format in order to be integrated as a decimal value inside a new column entitled model_score. The output dataset then contains the two original columnsSentence1 and Sentence2 from the test dataset, and as well as two similarity score columns, the first one corresponding to the reference similarity score and the second one being provided by the generative model. 2.5. Iterate on test dataset An iteration is then carried out on each sentence pairs from the test dataset, using the conversational chain described in the previous paragraph to determine a similarity score for each of them. A newconversational chain is therefore created at each iteration, the only J. Bertin, 2024 4 Adv ancing Similarity Search with GenAI difference at each iteration concerning the user prompt being updated with a new sentence pairs at each iteration. A formalism test is also implemented to ensure that all responses retrieved by the model corresponds to the expected output : the iteration will simply move on to the next sentence pairs if the formatting conditions of
