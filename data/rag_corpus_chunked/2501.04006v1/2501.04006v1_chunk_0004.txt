2 lines from the train BIOSSES dataset. In total, the BIOSSES dataset contains 100 lines, distributed as follows: 64 lines builds the train dataset, 16 lines the validation dataset and 20 lines the test dataset. 2.2. Calculation metric for similarity The accuracy of the similarity search method proposed in this article is evaluated by the Pearson correlation between the similarity scores from the test dataset (also labeled reference similarity score) and the similarity score provided by the generative model. In general terms, the Pearson correlationbetween two variablesX and Y can be calculated using the following formula: rXY = Pn i=1(Xi − ¯X)(Yi − ¯Y )qPn i=1(Xi − ¯X)2 Pn i=1(Yi − ¯Y )2 (1) where: • rXY is thePearson correlationbetween X and Y, • n is the number of observations, • Xi and Yi are the values of observationsi for X and Y respectively, • ¯X and ¯Y are the means ofX and Y respectively. J. Bertin, 2024 Adv ancing Similarity Search with GenAI 3 In this paper, the variablesX and Y used to calculate the Pearson correlation are represented by two series of decimal numbers with values being contained between 0.0 and 4.0. Logically, the Person correlation is equal to 1 when theses two series are strictly correlated, i.e. when the similarity scores retrieved by the model are proportional (or even equal in this research work, since the amplitudes are equal) to thereference similarity scoresfurnished on the test dataset. 2.3. Prompt engineering for similarity search case The usage of a generative model to retrieve similarity scores between pairs of sentences from the BIOSSES dataset requires a suitable prompt, i.e. a set of clear instructions enabling the model to perform the task as accurately as possible. Memmert et al., 2024 investigated the effects of six prompt engineering techniques to generate
