et al., 2010, the advanced semantic understanding of generative models could by used to address the nearest search case. The proposed method in this article could therefore draw inspiration to address the case of nearest neighbor search using a generative model instead of traditional methods such as K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm. In the context of the studied case, it would be necessary to convert the entirety of the second column (Sentence 2) into a vector database. Then, an iteration would be performed on each element of the first column (Sentence1), asking the model which of the elements stored in the vector database would have the closest meaning. In an iterative way, this method would therefore allow to find for each entity from the first table the closest related element of the second table. 5. CONCLUSION This article has introduced an innovative approach to address the similarity search case using a generative model. The Retrieval Augmented Generation method has been explored to construct a conversational chain, enabling an advanced understanding of sentences and consequently providing accurate similarity scores. An in-depth analysis was conducted to assess the model’s sensitivity to parameters such as temperature and the number of examples included in the system prompt. The results demonstrated that moderate temperature values and an optimal number of examples in the system prompt lead to high Pearson correlation scores, surpassing the performance of existing similarity search methods. However, some limitations were identified, particularly in terms of computational resources and the model’s sensitivity to the expected output. Improvement suggestions were proposed, including the optimization of the prompt used and the exploration of more advanced prompt engineering techniques. In conclusion, this research represents a significant advancement in the field of similarity search by leveraging the capabilities of generative models. The promising results offer potential development for future
