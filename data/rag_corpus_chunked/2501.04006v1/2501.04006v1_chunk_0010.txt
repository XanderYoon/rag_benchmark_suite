As showed by Marvin et al., 2024, the inclusion of examples within the prompt improves the response accuracy by helping the model to precisely J. Bertin, 2024 Adv ancing Similarity Search with GenAI 5 Figure 3. Evolution of similarity results with the number of examples given to the prompt understand the expected task. This consideration is related to the adversarial prompt research field which consist to provideadversarial examples to the model (i.e. slight modifications of correctly classified inputs) to avoid miss-classification when the response is given (Alzantot et al., 2018). 3.3. Cross-factor analysis In order to observe the model sensitivity related to the combined variation of the two factors under study (temperature and number of examples supplied in the system prompt), a table providing Pearson correlation values has been retrieved: temperature values are still incremented from 0 to 1 with a step of 0.1, while sample size of examples supplied to the prompt system is incremented from 0 to 60 with a step of 10. Figure 4. Pearson correlation as function of temperature and sample size AsshownonFigure4,thehighest Pearson correlationis equal to0.905 and is obtained for a temperature value of 0.5 and a sample size of 20 examples. This result appears to exceed the correlation value of 0.871 obtained by the supervised combination of several methodsproposed by Kathrin Blagec et al., 2019 and consequently, also surpasses the correlation results obtained earlier by Chen et al., 2018 and Sogancıoglu et al., 2017. 4. DISCUSSION 4.1. Limitations and constraints An apparent limitation of the proposed architecture concern the computational resources required to process the data for in an iterative way: each iteration requires indeed theconversational chainto be rebuilt on the basis of the adapteduser prompt. As a result, this solution is neither optimized in terms of computational resources, nor in terms of financial
