the most optimized and personalized distance metric suited to the use case under study. Using the appropriate phrasing, the proposed Retrieval Augmented Generation method enables consequently to spell out what distinguishes a small distance (i.e. the two phrases have very similar meanings) from a larger distance (i.e. the two sentences have more distant meanings). 2.1. Presentation of the BIOSSES dataset The research will be conducted on the BIOSSES (Biomedical Semantic Similarity Estimation System) dataset created by Sogancıoglu et al., 2017. This dataset contains 100 pairs of sentences associated with a similarity score range from 0 to 4 (based on the guidelines of SemEval 2012 Task 6 on STS proposed by Agirre et al., 2012) and evaluated by five different human expert. The sentences in the BIOSSES dataset are extracted from citationsofbiomedicalarticlesinsuchawaythateachpair of sentences either refers to the same or in the contrary to different articles : this design aims to cover a wide range of semantic similarities, from sentences closely related in meaning to sentences with more distant semantic connections. A short extract of two lines extracted from the BIOSSES dataset is presented below : Sentence 1 Sentence 2 Score The oncogenic activ- ity of mutant Kras appears dependent on functional Craf. Oncogenic KRAS mutations are com- mon in cancer. 2.2 The up-regulation of miR-146a was also detected in cervical cancer tissues. The expression of miR-146a has been found to be up- regulated in cervical cancer. 4 Table 1.Extract of 2 lines from the train BIOSSES dataset. In total, the BIOSSES dataset contains 100 lines, distributed as follows: 64 lines builds the train dataset, 16 lines the validation dataset and 20 lines the test dataset. 2.2. Calculation metric for similarity The accuracy of the similarity search method proposed in this article is evaluated by the Pearson correlation between the similarity
