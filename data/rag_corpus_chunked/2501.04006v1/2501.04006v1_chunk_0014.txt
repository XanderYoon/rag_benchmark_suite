of computational resources and the model’s sensitivity to the expected output. Improvement suggestions were proposed, including the optimization of the prompt used and the exploration of more advanced prompt engineering techniques. In conclusion, this research represents a significant advancement in the field of similarity search by leveraging the capabilities of generative models. The promising results offer potential development for future applications in any domain requiring a nuanced understanding of semantic similarities.
