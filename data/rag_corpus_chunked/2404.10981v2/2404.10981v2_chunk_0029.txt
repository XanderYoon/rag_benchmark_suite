By leveraging various strategies, including unsupervised tech- niques, supervised learning, and data augmentation, re-ranking aims to optimize the alignment between the retrieved content and the desired response, thereby improving the overall effectiveness of RAG systems [165]. Unsupervised Re-ranking. Unsupervised re-rankers do not rely on labeled data for training. They use strategies such as pointwise, listwise, or pairwise methods to rank documents based on LLM outputs without the need for supervised fine-tuning. For example, In-Context RALM [112] employs , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: August 2018. 16 Huang et al. a zero-shot approach where an off-the-shelf language model is used to re-rank the top-k documents retrieved by a BM25 retriever. This process involves selecting the document that maximizes the likelihood of the generated text, effectively using the
