Conditional Retrieval Strategy. Conditional retrieval strategies (Algorithm 3) are governed by specific conditions or rules, which may be predefined or dynamically determined during the process. This method ensures that retrieval aligns with specific constraints or criteria, enhancing relevance and specificity. It is particularly useful for compliance checking, rule-based recommendation systems, and context-sensitive information retrieval. PRCA [151] is a prime example, where retrieval strategies are adapted based on reward-driven adjustments, refining the context used by large language models to enhance precision and relevance. RARG [159] similarly emphasizes retrieval based on specific evidence conditions, ensuring that the retrieval process aligns with predefined requirements, which is critical for generating factual and polite responses.
