and diminish the importance of the less relevant ones. This step involves incorporating additional metrics and external knowledge sources to enhance precision. In this context, pre-trained models with superior accuracy but lower efficiency can be effectively employed due to the limited set of candidate documents available [54]. Filtering. Filtering aims to remove documents that fail to meet specified quality or relevance standards [56, 74]. This can be done through several approaches, such as establishing a minimum relevance score threshold to exclude documents below a certain relevance level. Furthermore, the use of feedback from users or prior relevance evaluations assists in adjusting the filtering process, guaranteeing that only the most relevant documents are retained for text generation. 2.2.4 Generation. The generation stage is a crucial component of the RAG process, responsi- ble for leveraging retrieved information to enhance the quality of the generated response. This stage encompasses several sub-steps aimed at producing content that is readable, engaging, and informative. Enhancing. At the heart of the generation phase is the enhancement step, where the objective is to merge the retrieved information with the user’s query to create a coherent and relevant response. This includes the process of elaboration, adding extra details to the retrieved content to enrich it. Efforts are focused on improving the output’s quality by increasing its clarity, coherence, and stylistic appeal through methods such as rephrasing and restructuring. Information from various sources is combined to offer a comprehensive perspective, and verification is conducted to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the content. Customization. Customization is user-centric. It encompasses tailoring content in two primary ways. First, it aligns the generated output with relevant information retrieved in earlier stages, ensuring consistency and accuracy by incorporating key knowledge. Second, it adapts the content to suit user-specific factors such as intended audience, situational
