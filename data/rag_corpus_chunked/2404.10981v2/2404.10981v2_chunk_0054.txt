query classification, retrieval, re-ranking, and generation—adds complexity and latency, which can hinder overall performance. Latency in Retrieval Processes. As document collections grow, retrieval and re-ranking processes increasingly become sources of latency. Lightweight search methods and hybrid retrieval approaches that combine sparse and dense techniques offer potential solutions by balancing speed and accuracy. For example, indexing, a traditionally resource-intensive process, has seen innovations through , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: August 2018. The Survey of Retrieval-Augmented Text Generation in Large Language Models 27 differentiable search indices such as DSI [128] and SEAL [7]. These methods integrate retrieval within Transformer models, enabling direct mapping of text queries to document identifiers and thereby improving both performance and retrieval efficiency. Computational Costs. The introduction of deep learning-based re-ranking models like monoT5 [102] and RankLLaMA [96] brings significant computational overhead, particularly in scenarios requiring iterative reasoning. Future research could focus on optimizing these models or developing retrieval pruning techniques that reduce the number of documents passed to the generation phase without sacrificing performance [145]. Modular Workflow Optimization. The complexity of RAG systems often stems from interde- pendencies between components like chunking strategies, embedding models, and re-ranking algorithms. Modular designs that enable independent optimization of each step while accounting for cross-component interactions are key to enhancing system throughput [39]. Advanced chunking methods and hybrid search strategies could offer trade-offs that maximize both retrieval precision and speed. An example is the Hybrid with HyDE [139] approach, which integrates both sparse and dense retrieval to capture relevant documents from both lexical and semantic perspectives. 9.3 Multimodal RAG The expansion of RAG systems to support multimodal data—encompassing text, images, and audio—presents new challenges. Integrating diverse modalities requires not only effective retrieval but also seamless alignment and generation across different data types. Cross-Modal Alignment. Aligning multimodal documents
