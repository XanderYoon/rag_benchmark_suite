leveraging external knowledge bases are commonly employed in query expansion. For example, the method described in FiD [ 58] expands the query by retrieving a wider range of passages using both sparse and dense retrieval techniques, enabling the model to aggregate evidence from multiple sources and thereby improving the accuracy and robustness of generated answers. A more advanced form of query expansion is demonstrated in Query2doc [137], where pseudo-documents generated by LLMs enhance the original query, effectively bridging the gap between the user’s input and the corpus information, which benefits both sparse and dense retrieval systems. Similarly, KnowledGPT [140] broadens the scope of information accessed during retrieval by leveraging external knowledge bases, further refining the retrieval process. The RARG [159] framework uses an evidence-driven query expansion approach, incorporating a wide array of supporting documents to generate informed and accurate counter-misinformation responses. Query Reformulation. Query reformulation involves rephrasing or restructuring the original query to enhance its effectiveness. This might include making the wording more specific, removing vague terms, or adjusting the syntax to better align with the retrieval system’s requirements. With LLMs, query reformulation can be dynamically driven by understanding the user’s intent and context, allowing for more precise modifications that lead to improved retrieval results. This reformulation process can also be informed by past queries or user interactions, adapting the query to better fit the specific retrieval task. For instance, the RQ-RAG [12] model represents an advanced form of query reformulation by rewriting, decomposing, and disambiguating queries, making it particularly effective in scenarios that demand complex query handling. This approach ensures that the refined query better matches the needed context, improving the relevance of retrieved information. Rewrite-Retrieve-Read framework [94] adjusts the original query to optimize the retrieval process, allowing the system to more effectively leverage retrieved data for generating accurate
