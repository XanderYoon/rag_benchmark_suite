trained to identify and re-rank relevant passages based on the output generated during the text generation process. GenRT [148] utilizes a combination of an encoder to capture global list-level features and a sequential decoder to reorder documents based on relevance. The model is trained to learn relevance scores through supervised learning, guided by labeled relevance data, ensuring that the most pertinent documents are prioritized in the final reranked list. Furthermore, ITER-RETGEN [121] proposes using a more capable re-ranker, which has access to model generations, to distill knowledge into a dense retriever. This knowledge distillation process optimizes the query encoder of the dense retriever, enabling it to better capture the semantic relevance of documents relative to the task input. Data Augmentation for Re-ranking. Data augmentation for re-rankers focuses on enhancing the training process by generating additional training data, such as pseudo-relevance labels, using LLMs. This data augmentation provides more varied training examples, which helps improve the performance of re-ranking models. For example, DKS-RAC [53] introduces methods like Dense Knowledge Similarity (DKS) and Retriever as Answer Classifier (RAC), which focus on improving the retrieval process by incorporating rich answer encodings. These methods involve generating additional training signals or utilizing enriched data representations to improve the retrieval and ranking of documents. Additionally, the PROMPTAGATOR [27] framework utilizes synthetic data generated through LLM-based query generation to enhance the training of the reranker. This data augmentation approach allows the re-ranker to refine candidate passages more effectively, using a cross-attention model trained on these additional examples to boost retrieval accuracy. 5.2 Filtering Filtering and re-ranking are distinct processes in the post-retrieval stage of RAG systems. Filtering focuses on eliminating irrelevant or low-quality documents from the retrieved set, thereby reducing the document set size and improving efficiency and effectiveness in subsequent processing. In contrast, re-ranking orders the
