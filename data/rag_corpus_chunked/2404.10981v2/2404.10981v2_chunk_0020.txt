varies, as it allows the system to fetch additional information to resolve uncertainties during the generation process. When addressing domain-specific retrieval challenges, SURGE [70] and PRCA [151] offer different solutions. SURGE uses a subgraph retriever to extract relevant subgraphs from knowledge graphs, , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: August 2018. The Survey of Retrieval-Augmented Text Generation in Large Language Models 11 integrating structured data into the retrieval process to improve the contextual understanding of generated responses. The relational structure of knowledge graphs allows for more accurate and informed retrieval. PRCA, in contrast, focuses on domain-specific abstractive summarization, using a reward-driven approach to refine the retrieved content. This strategy is designed to optimize content for the generator, particularly in scenarios where the generator functions as a black box, thereby enhancing alignment between retrieval and generation. MEMWALKER [13] presents a unique approach to handling long-context question answering by incorporating an internal search and ranking mechanism within a memory tree structure. This method navigates extensive memory stores, ensuring that the most relevant information is retrieved and used for complex queries. Unlike other methods, MEMWALKER emphasizes efficient processing of long texts through iterative navigation and summarization, rather than solely optimizing the initial retrieval phase. 4.2 Retrieval Strategy The retrieval strategies within RAG are vital for customizing the retrieval process to specific appli- cation needs, with each strategy offering distinct advantages and addressing particular challenges. In RAG, it is mostly the utilization of retrieval techniques rather than the exploration of retrieval algorithms that is involved, so it is the strategy of retrieval that is usually considered in searching and ranking. While basic RAGs are usually single-hop searches, i.e., they are retrieved only once as generated supplementary material, today’s RAGs are mostly multi-hop searches, i.e., they are searched several times through different search
