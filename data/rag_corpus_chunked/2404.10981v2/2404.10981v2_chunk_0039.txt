the generated content is not only aligned with retrieved knowledge but also personalized to the user’s particular values and requirements. This deep level of customization ensures that the output is both relevant and personally meaningful, enhancing user engagement. ROPG [118] proposes a dynamic pre- and post-generation retriever selection model, enhancing personalization by aligning the retrieval process with both the input context and the user’s pref- erences. The pre-generation model determines which retrieval strategy—such as recency-based, keyword matching, or semantic retrieval—is most appropriate before generation begins. By tailoring the retrieval process in this way, the model ensures that the documents retrieved from the user profile closely match the current input, thereby aligning the content with relevant user-specific knowledge. Following this, the post-generation model evaluates the outputs generated by different retrieval strategies and selects the most personalized result. This selection is guided by feedback from the generated content, which is then used to adjust future retrievals. By combining content alignment (through pre-generation retrieval) with contextual adaptation (through post-generation evaluation), this approach offers a comprehensive solution for customization within RAG. 7 Evaluation in RAG To assess how effectively language models can generate more accurate, relevant, and robust responses by leveraging external knowledge, the evaluation of RAG systems has emerged as a crucial research focus. Given the rising popularity of dialogue-based interactions, much recent work has concentrated on evaluating RAG models’ performance on such downstream tasks using established metrics like Exact Match (EM) and F1 scores. These metrics have been applied across a , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: August 2018. 20 Huang et al.
