SURGE [70] leverages this strategy through knowledge graphs, where relevant subgraphs are extracted to enhance contextual understanding. The relational structure of knowledge graphs facilitates navigating multiple layers of information, ensuring accurate and contextually relevant retrieval. MEMWALKER [13] similarly adopts a recursive approach, processing long texts by constructing a memory tree of summaries. The system navigates through this tree to retrieve relevant information, effectively breaking down complex queries into manageable segments, which is particularly useful for handling long-context question answering. IMRAG [ 150] introduces a multi-round retrieval mechanism, where each round of retrieval is based on the model’s internal monologues, progressively refining the search with each iteration. Selfmem [21] employs a self- memory module, enabling the system to store and retrieve information recursively, building upon previously retrieved knowledge in a hierarchical manner. This recursive strategy enhances the system’s ability to manage and integrate vast amounts of information across multiple retrieval iterations. Conditional Retrieval Strategy. Conditional retrieval strategies (Algorithm 3) are governed by specific conditions or rules, which may be predefined or dynamically determined during the process. This method ensures that retrieval aligns with specific constraints or criteria, enhancing relevance and specificity. It is particularly useful for compliance checking, rule-based recommendation systems, and context-sensitive information retrieval. PRCA [151] is a prime example,
