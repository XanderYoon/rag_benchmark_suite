13B), Vicuna-13B LRUS-CoverTree [93] 2024 k-MIPS Table 3. The summary of Retrievers and Generators. The retrieval models and pre-trained language models explicitly mentioned in these studies have been recorded. 8.2 Retriever and Generator In RAG, the retriever and generator are central components, each playing a distinct role in the system’s overall performance. Table 3 summarizes the retrievers and generators used across the studies discussed in this paper. The table reveals that while a wide range of advanced language models are employed as generators, many systems still rely on traditional retrievers like BM25, valued for their efficiency. This highlights the continued importance of optimizing retrieval methods while balancing computational demands. Interestingly, despite the availability of powerful models such as LLaMA2, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4, these are not widely adopted as generators. Instead, models like T5 remain prevalent, while more foundational retrieval approaches, such as those based on BERT, see limited use. The relative scarcity of IR-focused LLMs in retrievers suggests a promising avenue for future research and development in this domain. , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article .
