noted, indicating that iterative search rounds generally yield superior results. In other words, most methods employ dense retrieval to secure higher quality candidate documents. Compared to modifying datasets in the pre-retrieval stage, more studies focus on manipulating the query to improve retrieval performance. Additionally, there is a significant emphasis on optimizing the retrieval phase, highlighting its crucial role in the research. However, there seems to be a scarcity of studies concentrating on customization in the generation stage, pointing to this as a potential area for future exploration. Overall, while the goal of RAG is to enhance the response quality of LLMs, greater efforts have been directed towards improving retrieval aspects. , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article .
