reformulation by rewriting, decomposing, and disambiguating queries, making it particularly effective in scenarios that demand complex query handling. This approach ensures that the refined query better matches the needed context, improving the relevance of retrieved information. Rewrite-Retrieve-Read framework [94] adjusts the original query to optimize the retrieval process, allowing the system to more effectively leverage retrieved data for generating accurate responses. Additionally, FLARE [65] exemplifies query reformulation through its active retrieval-augmented generation approach, which iteratively refines the query based on a feedback loop between retrieval and generation, thereby enhancing the accuracy and relevance of the retrieved information. Prompt-based Rewriting. Prompt-based rewriting, particularly in the context of LLMs, represents an innovative approach where the original query is embedded within a larger prompt or context to guide the LLM’s response. This technique harnesses the model’s ability to understand and generate language within a specific context, effectively rewriting the query to align with the desired output. Prompt-based rewriting is especially powerful in scenarios where the retrieval process is integrated into a generative workflow, allowing the system to adapt the query to various stages of retrieval and generation. This approach may also involve dynamic prompts that evolve based on interaction, further refining the retrieval process. For example, Step-Back [163] refines the query context through carefully crafted prompts that guide the LLM’s reasoning process, ensuring that the outputs are more aligned with the user’s intent, particularly in complex reasoning tasks. The CoK [86] method focuses on dynamically adapting the knowledge source and using prompts to rewrite the context in which a query is interpreted. This approach leverages prompt-based rewriting to enable the LLM to effectively integrate and ground its responses based on various heterogeneous knowledge sources. Additionally, Promptagator [27] discusses using prompt-based techniques to adapt and rewrite the query to better align with the retrieval
