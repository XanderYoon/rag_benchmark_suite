research focuses and inconsistent terminology for similar methods, leading to confusion. This survey seeks to bridge this gap by offering a structured overview of RAG, categorizing various approaches, and providing an in-depth understanding of the current research landscape, with a focus on textual applications given their prominence in recent research. To provide clarity and structure, this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 outlines the overall RAG workflow, dividing the methodologies into pre-retrieval, retrieval, post-retrieval, and generation phases. Sections 3 through 6 explore the core techniques within each phase. Section 7 focuses on the evaluation methodologies for RAG. Section 8 summarizes the reviewed studies, detailing the retrievers and generators used, while Section 9 discusses challenges and future research directions, extending beyond text-based studies to include multimodal data applications. The paper concludes with Section 10. Other related surveys provide valuable insights into the evolving RAG landscape from different angles. Gao et al. [38] identified three key stages in RAG development: pre-training enhancement, inference, and fine-tuning. Zhao et al. [162] focused on the diverse applications of RAG, including text, code, image, and video generation, emphasizing augmented intelligence in generative tasks. Meanwhile, Hu et al. [48] explored Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs), examining how interactions between retrievers, language models, and augmentations influence model architectures and applications. In this paper, we aim to offer a comprehensive and unified framework for understanding RAG from an information retrieval (IR) perspective, identifying key challenges and areas for improvement. We delve into the core technologies that drive RAG, assessing their effectiveness in addressing retrieval and generation tasks. Additionally, this survey introduces the evaluation methods employed in RAG research, highlights current limitations, and proposes promising avenues for future exploration. , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article .
