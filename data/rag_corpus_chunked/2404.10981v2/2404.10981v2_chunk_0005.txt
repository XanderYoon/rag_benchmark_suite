the effectiveness of RAG. Over time, RAG has evolved from a means of providing supplementary information to enabling multiple interactions between the retrieval and generation components. This involves conducting several rounds of retrieval to refine the accuracy of the information retrieved and iteratively improve the quality of the generated output. Toolkits such as LangChain1 and LlamaIndex2 have modularized the RAG approach, enhancing its adaptability and expanding its range of applications. Despite these toolkits employing diverse methodologies to tackle different aspects of RAG—from multiple search iterations to iterative generation—they maintain adherence to the fundamental RAG workflow. This consistency is crucial for understanding their operation and pinpointing opportunities for further development. 2.1 Basic RAG Workflow Figure 2 represents the unified RAG core concepts with basic workflow. The workflow of RAG begins with the creation of an index comprising external sources. This index serves as the basis for retrieving relevant information through a retriever model based on a specific query. The final step 1https://www.langchain.com 2https://www.llamaindex.ai , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: August 2018. 4 Huang et al. involves a generator model, which combines the retrieved information with the query to produce the desired output. 2.1.1 Indexing. Efficient retrieval begins with comprehensive indexing, where data preparation is key. This stage involves text normalization processes such as tokenization, stemming, and the removal of stop words to enhance the text’s suitability for indexing [98]. Text segments are then organized into sentences or paragraphs to facilitate more focused searches, allowing for the pinpointing of segments containing pertinent keywords. The integration of deep learning has revolutionized indexing through the use of pretrained LMs for generating semantic vector representations of texts. These vectors are stored, enabling rapid and precise retrieval from extensive data collections, significantly enhancing retrieval efficiency. 2.1.2 Retrieval. While traditional retrieval methods, such as
