can help bridge this gap. By allowing retrieval systems to find more relevant documents even from suboptimal queries, HyDE improves retrieval accuracy, albeit with a trade-off in computational cost. Future research could focus on optimizing this process to balance improved retrieval accuracy with reduced latency. Information Integration. Complex queries often require synthesizing information from multi- ple documents, yet fragmented or conflicting information can result in incoherent or incomplete answers. Pre- and post-retrieval techniques play a critical role in addressing this challenge. Enhanc- ing retrieval granularity and incorporating techniques like entity-level retrieval and re-ranking can improve the cohesiveness of retrieved documents. However, many post-retrieval methods, as investigated by Zhu et al. [ 165], rely heavily on calling LLM APIs, which incurs significant costs. Exploring alternatives such as knowledge distillation to lightweight models could offer more scalable solutions, making advanced retrieval strategies more practical in online settings. Recent research highlights the development of generative models for search as a promising direction for improving retrieval quality. Models like GERE [15] and PARADE [84] enhance docu- ment re-ranking and fact verification by directly generating relevant document titles or evidence sentences. Fine-tuning pre-trained models like RankT5 [166] for ranking-specific tasks has also demonstrated potential in boosting out-of-domain performance, which is crucial for generalizing RAG systems across diverse contexts. 9.2 System Efficiency System efficiency remains a significant bottleneck, especially as RAG systems scale to handle large datasets and real-time applications. The multi-step nature of RAG workflows—including query classification, retrieval, re-ranking, and generation—adds complexity and latency, which can hinder overall performance. Latency in Retrieval Processes. As document collections grow, retrieval and re-ranking processes increasingly become sources of latency. Lightweight search methods and hybrid retrieval approaches that combine sparse and dense techniques offer potential solutions by balancing speed and accuracy. For example, indexing, a traditionally resource-intensive process, has
