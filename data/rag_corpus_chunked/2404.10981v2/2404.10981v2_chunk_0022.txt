benefit from detailed exploration. ITER-RETGEN [121] also employs iterative retrieval, refining the process based on generated responses, allowing for continuous improvement and closer alignment between retrieval and generation. RQ-RAG [12] advances this approach by using techniques like query rewriting, decomposition, and disambiguation, refining the retrieval step-by- step to enhance the final output. PlanRAG [81] also fits within this strategy, iteratively refining the retrieval process based on generated content and feedback, ensuring that each step is better informed than the last. Recursive Retrieval Strategy. Recursive retrieval (Algorithm 2) involves retrieval that can call itself, creating a hierarchy or tree of retrievals. This method effectively handles hierarchical or layered information by breaking down complex queries into simpler sub-queries. It is particularly useful for hierarchical data exploration, knowledge base construction, and detailed information , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: August 2018. 12 Huang et al. Algorithm 1 Iterative Retrieval Strategy in RAG Require: Query 𝑞, Documents 𝐷, Maximum Iterations 𝑁 , Retriever 𝑅, Generator 𝐺, Pre-retrieval Function 𝐹𝑝𝑟𝑒 , Post-retrieval Function 𝐹𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡 Ensure: Final Output 𝑦𝑓 𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙 1: Initialize 𝑖 ← 1 // Start iteration counter 2: while 𝑖 ≤ 𝑁 do 3: Pre-retrieval Phase 4: 𝑞′ ← 𝐹𝑝𝑟𝑒 (𝑞) // Indexing, Query Manipulation, Data Modification 5: Retrieval Phase 6: 𝐷𝑖 ← 𝑅(𝑞′, 𝐷) // Search and initial ranking of documents 7: Post-retrieval Phase 8: 𝐷 ′ 𝑖 ← 𝐹𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡 (𝑞′, 𝐷𝑖 ) // Re-ranking and filtering to refine documents 9: Generation Phase 10: 𝑦𝑖 ← 𝐺 (𝑞′, 𝐷′ 𝑖 ) // Generate output based on refined documents 11: if stopping condition met based on 𝑦𝑖 then 12: BREAK // Stop iterations if output is satisfactory 13: end if 14: Update 𝑞′ ← UpdateQuery(𝑞, 𝑦𝑖 ) // Refine query based on the generated output 15: 𝑖 ← 𝑖 + 1
