In this experiment, T5small (60M parameters) and T5-base (220M parameters) with FiD are used. The documents are retrieved using BM25. Fig. 5. Retriever and generator experiment results sourced from eRAG [119] and BERGEN [114]. from retrieval than larger models like LLaMA2-70B. In fact, LLaMA2-7B with retrieval outperforms LLaMA2-70B in a closed-book setting, suggesting that retrieval augmentation can make smaller models more competitive. Similarly, results from the eRAG experiments in Figure 5c indicate that varying LLM sizes (e.g., T5-small vs. T5-base) does not significantly affect the correlation between eRAG and downstream performance. These findings highlight that retrieval quality has a more substantial impact on RAG performance than the choice of generator, reinforcing the notion that investing in better retrieval strategies often yields more benefits than relying solely on larger LLMs. 9 Challenges and Future Directions The evolving landscape of RAG systems faces significant challenges that impact the quality of generated outputs, system efficiency, and the integration of multimodal data. As these systems become more prevalent across a range of applications, addressing these challenges is essential for improving their effectiveness and scalability. , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article .
