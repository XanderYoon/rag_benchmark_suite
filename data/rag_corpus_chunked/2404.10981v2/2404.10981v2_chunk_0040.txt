The Comparison of Different RAG Evaluation Frameworks. wide array of datasets, including TriviaQA [69], HotpotQA [153], FEVER [129], Natural Questions (NQ) [76], Wizard of Wikipedia (WoW) [30], and T-REX [32], which are often used to benchmark the effectiveness of retrieval and generation components in knowledge-intensive tasks. While downstream task evaluations provide valuable insights, they fail to address the multifaceted challenges that arise as RAG systems continue to evolve. To fill this gap, recent research has proposed various frameworks and benchmarks that aim to evaluate these systems from multiple perspectives, considering not only the quality of the generated text but also the relevance of retrieved documents and the system’s resilience to misinformation, as shown in Table 1. These evaluations include metrics that assess noise robustness, negative prompting, information integration, and counterfactual robustness,
