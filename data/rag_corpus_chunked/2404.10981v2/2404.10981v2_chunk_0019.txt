a two-stage retrieval pipeline that identifies and ranks relevant documents, which are then used to support and enhance the factual accuracy of generated responses. 4 Retrieval 4.1 Search & Ranking The search and ranking process within RAG is crucial for improving the relevance and accuracy of generated outputs. Several methodologies have been developed to refine this process, each contributing unique strategies for enhancing retrieval and ranking. For example, Atlas [59] and AAR [157] both aim to improve the relevance of retrieved documents, but they approach this challenge differently. Atlas focuses on optimizing the retriever’s ability to select contextually relevant documents, especially in new domains with limited data, by employing few-shot learning techniques such as Attention Distillation and Perplexity Distillation. AAR, on the other hand, adapts retrieval preferences to better align with the requirements of LLMs, enhancing retrieval generalization across tasks by training a smaller source model. , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article .

Additionally, IRCOT [131] and FLARE [65] introduce dynamic interactions within the retrieval process, albeit with distinct goals. IRCOT integrates retrieval with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, interleaving these processes to ensure that each retrieval step supports the ongoing reasoning task. FLARE, in contrast, adopts a confidence-based active retrieval mechanism, dynamically triggering retrieval when the model generates low-confidence tokens. This approach is particularly useful in scenarios where model confidence varies, as it allows the system to fetch additional information to resolve uncertainties during the generation process. When addressing domain-specific retrieval challenges, SURGE [70] and PRCA [151] offer different solutions. SURGE uses a subgraph retriever to extract relevant subgraphs from knowledge graphs, , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: August 2018. The Survey of Retrieval-Augmented Text Generation in
