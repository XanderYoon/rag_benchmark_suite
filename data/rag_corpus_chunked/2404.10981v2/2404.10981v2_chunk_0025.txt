Adaptive Retrieval Strategy. Adaptive retrieval (Algorithm 4) dynamically adjusts the retrieval strategy based on the context and nature of the query or the data retrieved so far. This highly flexible method tailors retrieval approaches on-the-fly to optimize for relevance and precision, making it ideal for personalized search engines, adaptive learning systems, and real-time decision support. AAR [157] exemplifies adaptive retrieval by adjusting its strategy based on the prefer- ences of LLMs, learning from a small source model and generalizing to unseen tasks. FLARE [65] takes a similar adaptive approach but focuses on dynamically fetching additional information when model confidence is low, thereby
