of retrieval techniques rather than the exploration of retrieval algorithms that is involved, so it is the strategy of retrieval that is usually considered in searching and ranking. While basic RAGs are usually single-hop searches, i.e., they are retrieved only once as generated supplementary material, today’s RAGs are mostly multi-hop searches, i.e., they are searched several times through different search strategies until they are satisfied. In terms of practical applications these strategies belong to the design on the engineering pipeline. Figure 4 shows a typical case of the RAG framework with iterative retrieval strategy. There are five main retrieval strategies in RAG: Basic Retrieval Strategy. Basic retrieval strategies typically follow a linear workflow, moving sequentially through pre-retrieval, retrieval, post-retrieval, and generation phases. The Atlas [94] framework exemplifies this straightforward approach, guiding the retrieval process efficiently from start to finish without iterations or complex conditional modifications. REPLUG [122] similarly follows this basic strategy, augmenting black-box language models with retrieval in a simple manner, where the retrieved information is directly used to enhance the generation process. Iterative Retrieval Strategy. For more complex scenarios, iterative retrieval strategies (Algorithm 1) are employed, where information is retrieved in multiple steps, each informed by previous results. IRCOT [131] exemplifies this by integrating retrieval with chain-of-thought reasoning, where the retrieval process is sequential and closely tied to reasoning steps. This method is particularly effective in scenarios requiring multi-step problem-solving, such as research assistance or complex queries that benefit from detailed exploration. ITER-RETGEN [121] also employs iterative retrieval, refining the process based on generated responses, allowing for continuous improvement and closer alignment between retrieval and generation. RQ-RAG [12] advances this approach by using techniques like query rewriting, decomposition, and disambiguation, refining the retrieval step-by- step to enhance the final output. PlanRAG [81] also fits within this strategy, iteratively
