effectiveness of graph-based approaches. Product Quantization. PQ is one of the most representative methods for handling large-scale data. It accelerates searches by segmenting vectors and then clustering each part for quantization. Unlike graph-based methods, which speed up searches by reducing the number of vectors for distance calculation, PQ achieves faster searches by reducing the time spent on calculating word distances. Several implementations of PQ have emerged in RAG, each improving its efficiency and scalability in different ways. PipeRAG [64] integrates PQ within a pipeline-parallelism framework to enhance retrieval-augmented generation by optimizing retrieval intervals. Chameleon system [63] leverages PQ in a disaggregated accelerator environment to balance memory usage and retrieval speed in RAG tasks. AiSAQ [126] introduces an all-in-storage ANNS method that offloads PQ vectors from DRAM to storage, drastically reducing memory usage while maintaining high recall. It demonstrates that even with billion-scale datasets, memory usage can be minimized to around 10 MB with only minor latency increases, making it a highly scalable solution for RAG systems. Locality-sensitive Hashing. The core idea of LSH is to place similar vectors into the same hash bucket with high probability. LSH uses hash functions that map similar vectors to the same or nearby hash values, making it easier to find approximate nearest neighbours. In LSH, when a query vector is hashed, the system quickly retrieves candidate vectors that share the same hash value. This method reduces the dimensionality of the problem and can be implemented efficiently, but it may introduce some inaccuracies due to the hashing process itself. While LSH is rarely used in RAG systems compared to graph-based and PQ methods, it still offers a useful approach in scenarios where speed is prioritized over the slight loss in accuracy. 3.2 Query Manipulation Query manipulation is pivotal in enhancing the effectiveness and accuracy of
