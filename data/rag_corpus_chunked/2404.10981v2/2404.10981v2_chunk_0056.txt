significance in enhancing the capabilities of LLMs. Through a structured overview of RAG, categorizing various methods, and an in-depth analysis of its core technologies and evaluation methods, this study illuminates the path for future research. It identifies crucial areas for improvement and outlines potential directions for advancing RAG applications, especially in textual contexts. This survey aims to elucidate the core concepts of the RAG field from a retrieval perspective, and it is intended to facilitate further exploration and innovation in the accurate retrieval and generation of information. , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article .
