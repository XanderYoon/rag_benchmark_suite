As these systems become more prevalent across a range of applications, addressing these challenges is essential for improving their effectiveness and scalability. , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article .

Current retrieval methods, however, frequently struggle with issues like noise, irrelevant documents, and fragmented information, all of which compromise the generation process. Noise Robustness. Irrelevant or misleading documents within the retrieved set can introduce noise, leading to hallucinations or unreliable answers. This challenge highlights the need for more sophisticated filtering and context-aware retrieval methods that can better differentiate relevant from irrelevant content. However, Cuconasu et al. [ 26] present an interesting perspective by showing that, under certain conditions, the inclusion of irrelevant documents can enhance overall accuracy. This finding challenges conventional retrieval strategies and suggests the potential for developing specialized approaches that strategically integrate noise within the retrieval process. Negative Rejection. When retrieval fails to return relevant results, models often attempt to generate responses regardless, increasing the risk of incorrect outputs. This issue is particularly problematic when queries are poorly expressed or lack sufficient context, making it difficult for retrieval models to surface relevant documents. Techniques like generating a pseudo-document that captures the query’s essence, as demonstrated by HyDE [36], can help bridge this gap. By allowing retrieval systems to find more relevant documents even from suboptimal queries, HyDE improves retrieval accuracy, albeit with a trade-off in computational cost. Future research could focus on optimizing this process to balance improved retrieval accuracy with reduced latency. Information Integration. Complex queries often require synthesizing information from multi- ple documents, yet fragmented or
