implemented efficiently, but it may introduce some inaccuracies due to the hashing process itself. While LSH is rarely used in RAG systems compared to graph-based and PQ methods, it still offers a useful approach in scenarios where speed is prioritized over the slight loss in accuracy. 3.2 Query Manipulation Query manipulation is pivotal in enhancing the effectiveness and accuracy of modern IR systems. By refining users’ original queries, it addresses challenges such as ambiguous phrasing and vocabulary mismatches between the query and target documents. This process involves more than merely replacing words with synonyms; it requires a deep understanding of user intent and the context of the query, particularly in complex tasks like RAG. Effective query manipulation significantly boosts retrieval performance, which in turn can greatly impact the quality of generated outputs. The three primary approaches to query manipulation are query expansion, query reformulation, and prompt-based rewriting. Query Expansion. Query expansion involves augmenting the original query with additional terms or phrases that are related to or synonymous with the query terms. In the context of LLMs, query expansion can be more sophisticated, utilizing the model’s extensive knowledge to generate contextually relevant expansions. This technique aims to improve recall by ensuring that the retrieval process captures a broader range of relevant documents, accommodating different 3https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/apis/bing-web-search-api , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article .

Techniques such as synonym expansion, semantic similarity, or leveraging external knowledge bases are commonly employed in query expansion. For example, the method described in FiD [ 58] expands the query by retrieving a wider range of passages using both sparse and dense retrieval techniques, enabling the model to aggregate evidence from multiple sources and thereby improving the accuracy and robustness of generated answers.
