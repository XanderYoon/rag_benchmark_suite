gap, recent research has proposed various frameworks and benchmarks that aim to evaluate these systems from multiple perspectives, considering not only the quality of the generated text but also the relevance of retrieved documents and the system’s resilience to misinformation, as shown in Table 1. These evaluations include metrics that assess noise robustness, negative prompting, information integration, and counterfactual robustness, all of which reflect the complex challenges RAG systems face in real- world applications. The ongoing development of comprehensive evaluation frameworks and metrics is essential for advancing the field, broadening the applicability of RAG systems, and ensuring that they meet the demands of an increasingly dynamic and complex information landscape [154]. 7.1 Retrieval-based Aspect In information retrieval, standard metrics such as Mean Average Precision (MAP), Precision, Recip- rocal Rank, and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) [103, 110, 115] have traditionally been used to evaluate the relevance of retrieved documents to a given query. These metrics are essential in assessing the effectiveness of traditional information retrieval systems, where the primary goal is to measure how well the retrieved documents match the user’s query. When applied to RAG systems, these retrieval-based metrics extend their focus to consider how the retrieved information contributes to the quality of the generated output. In this context, Accuracy becomes a crucial metric, assessing how precisely the retrieved documents provide correct information for answering queries. Additionally, Rejection Rate [14], which measures the system’s ability to decline answering when no relevant information is available, has emerged as a , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article .

Similarly, Error Detection Rate [14] evaluates the model’s capability to identify and filter out incorrect or misleading information, ensuring that the generation process
