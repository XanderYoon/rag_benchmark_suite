Survey of Retrieval-Augmented Text Generation in Large Language Models 5 the query to align more closely with the user’s intention; query expansion [51], which extends the query to capture more relevant results through synonyms or related terms; and query normalization, which resolves differences in spelling or terminology for consistent query matching. Data Modification. Data modification is also critical in enhancing retrieval efficiency. This step includes preprocessing techniques like removing irrelevant or redundant information to improve the quality of results and enriching the data with additional information such as metadata to boost the relevance and diversity of the retrieved content [6]. 2.2.2 Retrieval. Search & Ranking. The retrieval stage is the combination of search and ranking. It focuses on selecting and prioritizing documents from a dataset to enhance the quality of the generation model’s outputs. This stage employs search algorithms to navigate through the indexed data, finding documents that match a user’s query. After identifying relevant documents, the process of initially ranking these documents starts to sort them according to their relevance to the query. 2.2.3 Post-Retrieval. The post-retrieval phase serves to refine the initially retrieved documents to improve the quality of text generation. This phase consists of re-ranking and filtering, each aimed at optimizing the document selection for the final generation task. Re-Ranking. In the re-ranking step, the documents previously retrieved are reassessed, scored, and reorganized. The objective is to more accurately highlight the documents most relevant to the query and diminish the importance of the less relevant ones. This step involves incorporating additional metrics and external knowledge sources to enhance precision. In this context, pre-trained models with superior accuracy but lower efficiency can be effectively employed due to the limited set of candidate documents available [54]. Filtering. Filtering aims to remove documents that fail to meet specified quality or
