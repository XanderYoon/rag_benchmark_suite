intents. (iii) Potential improvements could include advanced hard negative mining to enhance relevance discrimination and multi-ob- jective optimization to balance relevance with efficiency, fairness, and diversity. (iv) A comprehensive comparison with scalableGenIR baselines such as RIPOR and PAG remains an avenue for future research to assess DDRO’s scalability and integration potential in large-scale retrieval scenarios.
