model, and reinforcement learning techniques incorporating pointwise, pairwise, and list- wise approaches to enhance ranking performance. While effective, this approach introduces considerable complexity, requiring the training of multiple models and sampling from the policy during training, which substantially increases computational costs.

Inspired by the work of Rafailov et al. [40], we propose direct doc- ument relevance optimization (DDRO), a streamlined approach de- signed to enhance the ranking capabilities ofGenIR models. DDRO directly optimizes GenIR models to learn document-level rank- ing without relying on explicit reward modeling or reinforcement learning. While our optimization is inspired by the DPO frame- work [40], its adaptation to GenIR is non-trivial. Unlike preference alignment for open-ended generation, our task involves optimizing structured docid generation under beam decoding constraints. Ad- ditionally, our method differs in both architecture (encoder-decoder vs. decoder-only) and objective (document ranking vs. preference alignment), requiring novel integration into GenIR pipelines. To the best of our knowledge, DDRO is the first method to apply preference-style optimization directly to generative document re- trieval by extending
