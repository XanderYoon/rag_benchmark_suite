5𝜃 (𝑞 𝑗 )), (2) where 𝐷 represents the document set, and 𝑄 denotes the query set. This loss function enables parameter updates during both indexing and fine-tuning, enhancing the model’s ability to generate the most relevant docid for a given query or document. The retrieval phase employs a (constrained) beam search algorithm to decode the most probable docid, with their generation probabilities determining the final ranking [33, 60, 64, 70, 71, 80]. 3.2 Learning to Rank (L2R) L2R aims at training models to rank documents based on their relevance to a given query [ 6, 9, 63]. L2R methods can be classi- fied into point-wise, pair-wise, and list-wise approaches based on their learning objectives. (i) Point-wise methods [19] frame ranking as a classification problem by scoring individual documents in- dependently: 𝐿point = Í 𝑖 L (ˆ𝑠 (𝑑𝑖, 𝑞), 𝑠(𝑑𝑖, 𝑞)), where ˆ𝑠 (𝑑𝑖, 𝑞) and 𝑠 (𝑑𝑖, 𝑞) denote the predicted relevance score and ground truth relevance score, respectively. In GenIR, generated probabilities serve as relevance scores, aligning with this approach [ 60]. And the retrieval term in Eq. 2 belongs to this type. (ii) Pair-wise ap- proaches [6, 9, 15, 63] compare document pairs to determine relative preferences: 𝐿pair = Í (𝑑𝑖,𝑑𝑗 ) log 1 + exp − ˆ𝑠 (𝑑𝑖, 𝑞) − ˆ𝑠 (𝑑 𝑗 , 𝑞) , where 𝑑𝑖 and 𝑑 𝑗 are used as pairs to compare. DDRO shares similari- ties with traditional pairwise L2R methods such as RankNet [5] and LambdaRank [7], in that it optimizes a margin between relevant and non-relevant documents. It differs in that the ranking signal is used to supervise the generation of structured docid sequences via a generative decoder. Unlike typical L2R approaches that score docu- ments retrieved by an external system, DDRO learns to produce do- cids directly, making
