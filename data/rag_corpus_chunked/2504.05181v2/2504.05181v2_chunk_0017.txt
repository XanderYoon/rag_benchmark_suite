while improving relevance-based rank- ing. The DDRO update guides the model toward producing outputs better aligned with relevance by utilizing pairwise comparisons, of- fering a simplified alternative to RL-based approaches. The gradient w.r.t. the model parameters𝜃 is defined as in Eq. 7, where ˆ𝑟𝜃 (𝑞, 𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑑 ) = 𝛽 log 𝜋𝜃 (𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑑 | 𝑞) 𝜋ref(𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑑 | 𝑞) (11) is the reward implicitly defined by the model 𝜋𝜃 and the reference model 𝜋ref. The examples are weighted according to how much the implicit reward model ˆ𝑟𝜃 overestimates the ranking of the non- relevant docid compared to the relevant docid. This weighting is scaled by 𝛽, reflecting the degree of misjudgment while considering the strength of the KL divergence constraint. The sigmoid function 𝜎 (·) ensures smooth optimization, and the model parameters 𝜃 are adjusted to increase the likelihood of the relevant docids over non-relevant ones. This reparameterization streamlines the train- ing process by eliminating the need for an explicit reward model and iterative fine-tuning, providing a more stable and efficient framework for aligning the retrieval model with document-level relevance objectives. 5 Experimental Settings 5.1 Datasets and Evaluation Metrics Datasets. We conduct our experiments using two widely recog- nized benchmarks: the MS MARCO Document Ranking dataset2 [3] and theNatural Questions (NQ)dataset3 [23]. The MS MARCO document ranking dataset is widely used for document ranking tasks and contains a large collection of queries and web pages. Fol- lowing prior work [65, 76, 78, 79], we use a subset with 320k docu- ments and 360k query-document pairs for training.
