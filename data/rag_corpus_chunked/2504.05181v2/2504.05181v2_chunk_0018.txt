Figure 3: Architecture of the DDRO model, which fine-tunes the retrieval model through direct learning-to-rank (L2R) optimization using relevance feedback. Unlike GenRRL [ 76], DDRO directly optimizes with relevance judgment data, avoiding reinforcement learning, explicit reward modeling, and extensive hyperparameter tuning. For clarity, the model 𝜋 ref 𝜃 from the SFT phase is referred to as 𝜋 ref , with its param- eters frozen during this phase. introduced by Google, is a widely used benchmark in question- answering research. In this study, we use the NQ320k version, which includes 320k query-document pairs sourced from Wikipedia, with queries formulated in natural language. To ensure reliable evalua- tion and improve performance [26], we deduplicate documents by title and utilize the predefined training and validation splits. Evaluation metrics. Following [65, 76–79], we assess model per- formance using standard document retrieval metrics: Recall (R@1/5/ 10) and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR@10). Statistical significance is determined using paired t-tests with a threshold of 𝑝 < 0.05. 5.2 Baselines We evaluate our approach against three types of baseline: term- based retrieval, dense retrieval, and generative retrieval. Term-based retrieval. (i) BM25 [45], a probabilistic retrieval model commonly used as a standard baseline, implemented us- ing Pyserini.4 (ii) DocT5Query [38], which generates synthetic queries from documents using the T5 model [41], appending them to the original document text. Dense retrieval. (i) DPR [22], which utilizes a BERT-based dual encoder to produce dense embeddings for queries and documents. PseudoQ [49] improves DPR by generating pseudo-queries using K-means clustering over document embeddings. (ii) ANCE [68], a RoBERTa-based dual encoder that incorporates hard negatives retrieved from an asynchronously updated approximate
