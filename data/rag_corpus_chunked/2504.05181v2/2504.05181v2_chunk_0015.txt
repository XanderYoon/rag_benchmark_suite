content, terms are prioritized by their 𝑡 𝑓 -𝑖𝑑 𝑓 scores [44], with a subset of high- scoring terms selected to form a compressed representation, which is then mapped to the document’s docid: terms : {𝑤 𝑎, 𝑤𝑏, 𝑤𝑐 } → 𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑑, (8) where 𝑤 𝑎, 𝑤𝑏, 𝑤𝑐 are key terms selected based on their 𝑡 𝑓 -𝑖𝑑 𝑓 scores. Retrieval task. During retrieval, a pre-trained language model is fine-tuned with supervised query-docid pairs to learn seman- tic mappings between queries and their corresponding docids. A key challenge in this process is the scarcity of labeled click data, which limits the ability to establish effective query-to-docid asso- ciations. To mitigate this, pseudo-queries are generated directly from the document corpus [ 64, 80]. Specifically, the docTTTTT- query [38] model is fine-tuned using supervised click data from the MS MARCO document and NQ datasets. For each document, an initial passage serves as input, and the model produces 𝑘 predicted queries using beam search, denoted as 𝑄 = {𝑞1, . . . , 𝑞𝑘 }. These diverse datasets, including passage-to-docid pairs, super- vised query-docid pairs (derived from real-world relevance judg- ments), and synthetic pseudo-queries, are collectively used to train the 𝝅ref 𝜃 model. Using these comprehensive and diverse training data, the SFT model acquires a robust understanding of query- to-document mappings and learns to generate relevant docids by optimizing token-level generation probabilities for a given query. Training objective. The model is trained with a sequence-to- sequence objective, aiming to maximize the likelihood of the target sequence through teacher forcing [66]. Given an input sequence 𝑠, which can be any of the document formats or queries described above, the objective is defined as: 𝐿𝜃 SFT = arg max 𝜃 log 𝑃 (𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑑 ∗ | 𝑠, 𝜋 ref 𝜃 (𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑑 )), (9) where 𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑑 ∗
