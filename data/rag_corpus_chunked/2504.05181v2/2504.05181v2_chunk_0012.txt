open-ended generation, our task involves optimizing structured docid generation under beam decoding constraints. Ad- ditionally, our method differs in both architecture (encoder-decoder vs. decoder-only) and objective (document ranking vs. preference alignment), requiring novel integration into GenIR pipelines. To the best of our knowledge, DDRO is the first method to apply preference-style optimization directly to generative document re- trieval by extending DPO-style training to constrained generative settings, leveraging pairwise query-docid relevance supervision and constrained decoding. 4 Method We provide a comprehensive explanation of the proposedDDRO method. As depicted in Figure (1), the method initiates with the gen- eration of two categories of docids, designed to encapsulate diverse semantic and contextual features of the documents (Section 4.1). Subsequently, the retrieval model is trained through a combination of self-supervised and supervised learning techniques (Section 4.2). Finally, direct learning-to-rank (L2R) optimization is applied, using relevance feedback to refine the model’s ranking quality and align its outputs with document-level relevance (Section 4.3). 4.1 Docid Construction The methodology for constructing docids in this work is grounded in established frameworks [ 70, 71, 76, 79]. This approach uses keyword-based identifiers to effectively encapsulate the seman- tic and contextual information of the documents. URL and Title (TU). Titles in web search results are typically crafted to be descriptive, closely aligning with user search intent, while URLs often contain structured tokens, such as keywords or domains, that are highly indicative of relevance for web-based queries [79]. The structure of the URL reverses to prioritize seman- tically meaningful segments. When a URL lacks descriptive content (e.g., uses numeric IDs or generic paths), we fall back to a combi- nation of the document’s title and domain name as an alternative identifier. Formally, this docid variant is defined as: 𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑑 TU = ( reverse(URL), if the URL is semantically rich, title +
