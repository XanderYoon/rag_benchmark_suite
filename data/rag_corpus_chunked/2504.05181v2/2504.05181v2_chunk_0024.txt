former uses dense vectors to capture richer semantic infor- mation, which is consistent with earlier findings [31, 32]. (ii) The best-performing dense retrieval baseline, ANCE, outperforms oth- ers such as SEAL, NCI, and DSI-QG. This could be due to the fact that these generative retrieval baselines rely solely on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to learn relevance, which may not fully capture the relevance patterns. However, ANCE lags behind mod- els like Ultron, ROGER, and LTGR, which employ more advanced optimization strategies. This highlights the need for fine-grained relevance modeling to enhance generative retrieval ranking perfor- mance. (iii) Our proposed DDRO (TU) outperforms these generative retrieval baselines, achieving 15.63% and 8.03% higher R@1 and MRR@10, respectively, compared to the best-performing baseline, ROGER-Ultron. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our document-level relevance optimization approach. While ROGER-Ul- tron achieves the highest R@10, DDRO (TU) delivers comparable performance within a more efficient and lightweight framework. 6.3 Ablation Study To address RQ3, an ablation study was conducted to assess the im- pact of pairwise ranking optimization onDDRO performance. From Table 4, we can find: (i) On the MS MARCO dataset, removing pair- wise ranking optimization significantly reduces intermediate and broader recall metrics (R@5 and R@10) for both DDRO variants, highlighting its critical role in improving retrieval performance. (ii) On the NQ dataset, excluding pairwise ranking optimization leads to consistent declines across all metrics, with a more pro- nounced impact on DDRO (PQ), particularly in early precision and broader recall. This underscores the importance of pairwise ranking in enhancing retrieval effectiveness at various ranking depths. These findings confirm that pairwise ranking optimization ef- fectively aligns model predictions with document relevance, con- tributing to improved performance across different ranking levels.
