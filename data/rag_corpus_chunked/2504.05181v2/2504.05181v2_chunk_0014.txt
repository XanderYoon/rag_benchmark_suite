to achieve alignment with the ground truth. Indexing task. To memorize the corpus, the indexing task learns associations between documents and docids, making the document input format a crucial factor. Inspired by the indexing strategy pro- posed in [79], we generate self-supervised learning signals directly from the document corpus.

Text segments are mapped to their corresponding docids, en- abling the model to link document passages with their broader context [8, 79]. Each document is divided into fixed-size passages, paired with the document’s docid to create passage-to-docid pairs. For a document containing 𝑁 terms, {𝑤 1, 𝑤2, . . . , 𝑤𝑁 }, multiple passage-to-docid pairs are generated as follows: passage : {𝑤𝑖, 𝑤𝑖+1, . . . , 𝑤𝑖+𝑚−1} → 𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑑, (7) where 𝑖 is the starting term of a passage, and 𝑚 is the fixed passage length. To emphasize a document’s core semantic content, terms are prioritized by their 𝑡 𝑓 -𝑖𝑑 𝑓 scores [44], with a subset of high- scoring terms selected to form a compressed representation, which is then mapped to the document’s docid: terms : {𝑤 𝑎, 𝑤𝑏, 𝑤𝑐 } → 𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑑, (8) where 𝑤 𝑎, 𝑤𝑏, 𝑤𝑐 are key terms selected based on their 𝑡 𝑓 -𝑖𝑑 𝑓 scores.
