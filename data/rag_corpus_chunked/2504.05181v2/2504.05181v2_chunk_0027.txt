4: Effect of KL constraint strength (𝛽) on DDRO perfor- mance. A moderate value ( 𝛽 = 0.4) yields the best MRR@10, while under- or over-regularization degrades performance. Table 4: Ablation study evaluating the impact of pairwise ranking optimization on DDRO performance across the MS300K and NQ320K datasets. Statistical significance is as- sessed using a paired t-test with a significance threshold of 𝑝 < 0.05. Statistically significant improvements ( 𝑝 < 0.05) are marked with a dagger symbol ( †), while non-significant improvements are underlined. Abbreviations: PQ – Product Quantization; TU – Title + URL.

(ii) Dense retrieval baselines, including DPR and ANCE, improve early ranking metrics over term-based methods. (iii) Generative retrieval baselines, such as ROGER-Ultron (TU) and LTRGR, perform well across all metrics. The proposed DDRO achieves the highest overall performance. Specifically, DDRO (PQ) surpasses the best-performing baseline, ROGER-Ultron (TU), by 36.27% in R@1 and 23.58% in MRR@10. Impact of Dataset Characteristics and Docid Selection. The docid design is a critical factor influencing performance in GenIR, we further analyze the differences in performance among various de- signs within our proposedDDRO. Our analysis underscores the crit- ical impact of docid design on retrieval performance across datasets. DDRO (TU) excels on MS MARCO, where shorter, keyword-driven queries align well with title and URL-based docids that capture Lightweight and Direct Document
