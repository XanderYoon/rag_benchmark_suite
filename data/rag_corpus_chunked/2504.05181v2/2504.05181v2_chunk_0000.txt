However, existing GenIR models suffer from token-level misalignment, where models trained to predict the next token often fail to capture document-level relevance effectively. While reinforcement learning-based methods, such as reinforcement learning from relevance feedback ( RLRF), aim to address this misalignment through reward modeling, they introduce significant complexity, requiring the optimization of an auxiliary reward function followed by reinforcement fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and often unstable. To ad- dress these challenges, we propose direct document relevance opti- mization (DDRO), which aligns token-level docid generation with document-level relevance estimation through direct optimization via pairwise ranking, eliminating the need for explicit reward model- ing and reinforcement learning. Experimental results on benchmark datasets, including MS MARCO document and Natural Questions, show that DDRO outperforms reinforcement learning-based meth- ods, achieving a 7.4% improvement in MRR@10 for MS MARCO and a 19.9% improvement for Natural Questions. These findings high- light DDRO’s potential to enhance retrieval effectiveness with a simplified optimization approach. By framing alignment as a direct optimization problem, DDRO simplifies the ranking optimization pipeline of GenIR models while offering a viable alternative to reinforcement learning-based methods.
