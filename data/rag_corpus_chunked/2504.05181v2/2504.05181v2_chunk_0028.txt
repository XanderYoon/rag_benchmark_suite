is a critical factor influencing performance in GenIR, we further analyze the differences in performance among various de- signs within our proposedDDRO. Our analysis underscores the crit- ical impact of docid design on retrieval performance across datasets. DDRO (TU) excels on MS MARCO, where shorter, keyword-driven queries align well with title and URL-based docids that capture Lightweight and Direct Document Relevance Optimization for Generative Information Retrieval SIGIR ’25, July 13–18, 2025, Padua, Italy Table 5: Comparison of retrieval model performance on the NQ320K dataset. The best-performing results are shown in bold. Statistical significance is determined using a paired t- test with a significance threshold of 𝑝 < 0.05, with a dagger symbol (†) indicating statistical significance. Results for cited models are drawn from their respective original publications. Abbreviations used: SI – Semantic ID; PQ – Product Quanti- zation; NG – N-grams; TU – Title + URL.

In contrast,DDRO (PQ) performs better on NQ, which features longer, complex queries requiring deeper semantic understanding. PQ-based docids effec- tively capture latent relationships, making them well-suited for NQ’s informational queries. These findings
