In contrast,DDRO (PQ) performs better on NQ, which features longer, complex queries requiring deeper semantic understanding. PQ-based docids effec- tively capture latent relationships, making them well-suited for NQ’s informational queries. These findings suggest that aligning docid strategies with dataset-specific characteristics enhances re- trieval effectiveness and model adaptability. 6.5 Analysis of Relevance Distribution The relevance distribution could, to some extent, reflect the re- trieval model’s ability to recognize relevance. Therefore, we analyze the retrieval performance of DDRO at different top positions in the generated docid list to address RQ5. We have the following observations: (i) Tables (3) and (5) demonstrate DDRO’s effective- ness across datasets, showcasing its adaptability. On MS MARCO, DDRO (TU) achieves the highest early precision, with statistically significant improvements in R@1 and MRR@10, and excels in inter- mediate ranking (R@5), outperforming models like ROGER-Ultron (TU) and LTRGR (SI). This highlights its ability to identify relevant documents early while maintaining strong intermediate perfor- mance. However, at broader recall levels (R@10), ROGER-Ultron (TU) shows a slight advantage over DDRO (TU). (ii) On NQ, DDRO (PQ) achieves the highest early precision (R@1, R@5), effectively ranking relevant documents for complex queries. The PQ-based docids capture deeper semantic relationships, leading to strong intermediate performance and competitive broader recall (R@10) against hybrid models such as ROGER-NCI (SI). Overall, DDRO consistently achieves strong performance with- out relying on auxiliary reward models, reinforcement learning, or dense retrieval signals. Instead, it employs SFT followed by pair- wise ranking optimization to refine early-stage precision while maintaining effectiveness across different ranking depths. 7 Conclusion We introduced DDRO, a novel approach for enhancing GenIR sys- tems by directly aligning docid generation with
