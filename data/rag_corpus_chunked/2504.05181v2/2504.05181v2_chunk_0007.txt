Direct Document Relevance Optimization for Generative Information Retrieval SIGIR ’25, July 13–18, 2025, Padua, Italy 3 Preliminaries and Motivations 3.1 Generative Information Retrieval (GenIR) GenIR models build on large pre-trained language models, such as T5 [41] and BART [27], and are designed to take a query string and generate a ranked list of document identifiers (docids) based on their generation probabilities, ordered in descending sequence. Each document 𝑑 is assigned a unique identifier docid = (docid1, docid2, . . . ,docid𝐿), where 𝐿 is the length of the identifier, and the model processes the query 𝑞 to autoregressively generate the corresponding docid using a scoring function defined as: 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 (docid | 𝑞) = 𝐿Ö 𝑖=1 𝑝𝜃 (docid𝑖 | docid1:𝑖 −1, 𝑞), (1) where 𝑝𝜃 denotes the generative retrieval model parameterized by 𝜃, and docid𝑖 is the 𝑖-th token of the docid for document 𝑑. The generation continues until a special end-of-sequence (EOS) token is decoded. Training is performed using a multi-task setup that combines indexing and fine-tuning, which yields better results than training these tasks separately [60]. During indexing, the model memorizes the document collection and maps each document’s text to its corresponding docid. Fine-tuning then refines this mapping by optimizing query-to-docid associations. The model is optimized via the following loss 𝐿𝜃 𝐷𝑆𝐼 with teacher forcing [66]: ∑︁ 𝑑𝑖 ∈𝐷 log 𝑃 (𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑑 𝑖 | 𝑇 5𝜃 (𝑑𝑖 )) + ∑︁ 𝑞 𝑗 ∈𝑄 log 𝑃 (𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑑 𝑖 | 𝑇 5𝜃 (𝑞 𝑗 )), (2) where 𝐷 represents the document set, and 𝑄 denotes the query set. This loss function enables parameter updates during both indexing and fine-tuning, enhancing the model’s ability to generate the most relevant docid for a given query or document. The retrieval phase employs a (constrained) beam search algorithm to decode the most probable docid, with
