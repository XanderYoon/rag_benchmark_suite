A new paradigm has re- cently been added to this palette, generative information retrieval (GenIR) [34, 60]. This approach uses pre-trained encoder-decoder models as differentiable search indexes (DSI). It has inspired the de- velopment of several models [4, 33, 43, 50, 52–55, 64, 70, 71, 79, 80] Generative information retrieval. GenIR models represent doc- uments as sequences of unique document identifiers (docids), gen- erated autoregressively, where each token is conditioned on the query encoding and previously generated tokens. The generation process is controlled through (constrained) beam search [ 33, 60, 64, 70, 71, 80]. Docids could be predefined and remain static dur- ing training, making their careful design crucial for optimal re- trieval performance [58]. We classify docids into two categories based on their generation methodology and abstraction level. The first category, referred to as content-derived
