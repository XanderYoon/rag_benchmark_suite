6: Model performance w.r.t. noise ratio on Beauty and Sports datasets. The bar represents HR@5 or NDCG@5, while the line represents the percentage of performance degrada- tion compared to the test user sequences without added noise. S, M, and L, while {S, L} denotes using parts of the memory bank, i.e., S and L, and so on. From the experimental results, we observe that different datasets show different preferences toward the com- binations of the partitions. Specifically, the beauty dataset prefers “All”; the sports dataset prefers{S, M}; the clothing dataset prefers {S, L}. We think the main reason is associated with #avg.length. As for the beauty dataset, its average length is longer than the other two datasets and it prefers the L partition. Specifically, the models with L partition largely outperform those without L parti- tion, as shown in Figure 5(a). As for the sports and clothing datasets, their average length is shorter than that of the beauty dataset, and they perform relatively worse when only provided with L partition, as shown in Figure 5(b) and 5(c). Besides, we observe that the model equipped with parts of the memory bank ( e.g., {S, M} is the best for the sports dataset and {S, L} is the best for the clothing dataset) even outperforms that with all parts of the memory bank. The above observations demonstrate that not all memories are beneficial and some ones are harmful to recommendation performance. This is also a challenging issue [ 6, 9, 51] in RAG that warrants further research. In a nutshell, we suggest trying different combinations or directly using all of the memories, because “All” usually leads to satisfactory performance. In this work, we use “All” by default. 4.7 Robustness against Noise Data (RQ6) In real-world scenarios, recommender systems usually suffer from the
