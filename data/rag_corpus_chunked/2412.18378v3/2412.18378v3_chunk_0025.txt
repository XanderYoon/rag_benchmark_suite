is also a challenging issue [ 6, 9, 51] in RAG that warrants further research. In a nutshell, we suggest trying different combinations or directly using all of the memories, because “All” usually leads to satisfactory performance. In this work, we use “All” by default. 4.7 Robustness against Noise Data (RQ6) In real-world scenarios, recommender systems usually suffer from the noisy interaction issue [11, 43], e.g., a user clicked an item by mistake. As such, it is necessary to verify RaSeRec’s robustness against noisy data. To simulate this scenario, we train models with full training data and randomly add a certain ratio (i.e., 10%, 20%, and 30%) of negative items into each test user sequence. The exper- imental results are shown in Figure 6, where models with retrieval augmentation mention “w/ aug” otherwise “w/o aug”. From the experimental results, we observe that adding noises significantly degrades the performance of models with or without retrieval aug- mentation. However, “w/ aug” consistently outperforms “w/o aug” under any noise ratio in terms of HR@5 and NDCG@5. Moreover, the blue line is always below the green line, as shown in Figure 6, demonstrating that “w/ aug” can endow the model backbone with more robustness against the noisy interactions during inference. For example, on the Beauty and Sports datasets, “w/ aug” with a 20% noise ratio outperforms “w/o aug” with a 10% noise ratio. Moreover, on the Sports dataset, “w/ aug” drops 14.7% of its original perfor- mance, while “w/o aug” drops 18.4%, in terms of NDCG@5, when both have a 10% noise ratio. This fully implies that with retrieval augmentation, RaSeRec can retrieve useful sequential patterns as references to alleviate the influence of noisy interactions and make a suitable recommendation. In a nutshell, we suggest performing retrieval augmentation to alleviate the negative influence of
