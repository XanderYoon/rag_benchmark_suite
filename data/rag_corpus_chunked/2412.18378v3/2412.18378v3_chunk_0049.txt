improvements of “w/ aug” over “w/o aug” are 10.96% and 18.67% in terms of HR@5 and NDCG@5, respectively. This demonstrates that even for high-frequency users, implicit memories may fall short of capturing user preferences accurately, while explicit memories can remedy this issue to a large extent. Secondly, we find the tendency of improvements w.r.t. different groups vary in datasets. For example, on the Beauty dataset, the improvement of high-frequency users is larger than that of low- frequency users. While on the sports dataset, different groups have similar performance improvements. We think the main reason is that the #avg.length of the sports dataset is shorter than that of the beauty dataset. As such, there are a lot of short- and medium-term memories in the memory bank of the sports dataset, as shown in Table 5. These memories can largely facilitate the performance of low- and medium-frequency users. Thirdly, we are surprised to find that there is no significant dif- ference in the performance of each group on the sports dataset. However, on the beauty dataset, high-frequency users perform bet- ter than low-frequency ones, which is in accordance with people’s intuition. We think the main reason is that the sports dataset is sparser than the beauty dataset. As such, there are not enough supervised signals for the model to learn high-quality user repre- sentation for long user sequences. This also explains why the model performs poorly when only the L partition is retained, as shown in Figure 5(b). In a nutshell, we suggest performing retrieval augmentation for both low- and high-frequency users.
