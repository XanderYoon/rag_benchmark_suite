Table 1 summarizes the space and time complexity of three SeRec paradigms, where we compare the com- plexity of RaSeRec with the Vanilla and SSL-Augmented SeRec to manifest the efficiency of RaSeRec. For space complexity, RaSeRec needs only 𝑂 (|𝜙 | + | 𝜃 |), where 𝜙 and 𝜃 represent the trainable pa- rameters of the RAM and sequence encoder, respectively. Generally, |𝜙 | is far below than |𝜃 |. As such, the analytical space complex- ity of RaSeRec is in the same magnitude as the Vanilla and SSL- Augmented one (𝑂 (|𝜃 |)). In practice, taking the Amazon Sports dataset as an example, the space occupation of RaSeRec is merely 0.05 times larger than theirs. As recommender systems mainly focus on the time cost of online serving, we analyze the time complexity during inference. The time complexity for encoding user representations is 𝑂 (𝐿(𝑇𝑑 2 + 𝑇 2𝑑)), where𝑇 is the maximum sequence length and𝑑 is the hidden size. In addition to encoding, RaSeRec also needs to retrieve memories and augment user representation. For retrieval, RaSeRec instantiates Faiss using Inverted File Indexing (IVF), whose retrieval complex- ity is 𝑂 (𝑘𝑑 + | V | 𝑘 𝑑),
