And the larger the GroupId, the more popular the target item. The results are shown in Figure 4. From the results, we observe that: (1) Compared with DuoRec, the performance improvements of RaSeRec mostly come from ac- curately recommending long-tailed and head items. This verifies that retrieval-augmented user representation well recalls both long- tailed and head patterns. (2) We observe that RaSeRec performs relatively worse in recommending general items, i.e., 5-th and 6-th RaSeRec: Retrieval-Augmented Sequential Recommendation Conference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY (a) Results on the Beauty dataset w.r.t.
