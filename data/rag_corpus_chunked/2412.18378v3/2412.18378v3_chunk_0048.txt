and manifests that setting a suitable number of retrieved memories can considerably enhance performance. The results on the three datasets follow similar trends, where the performance gradually improves as 𝐾 increases and then starts to degrade when further increasing 𝐾. This phenomenon is also observed in long-context RAG [19, 56], where the generative modeling performance initially increases and then declines when consistently increasing the num- ber of retrieved passages. The main reason is that increasing the number of retrieved memories will inevitably introduce irrelevant memories (i.e., “noise”) that can mislead the retrieval-augmented module. In conclusion, we suggest tuning 𝐾 in the range of 10 ∼ 30 for the Beauty and Sports datasets, and 30 ∼ 50 for the Clothing dataset. G Study on User Interaction Frequency (RQ8) To investigate the robustness of RaSeRec against low-frequency (short user sequence) and high-frequency users (long user sequence), we split the test user sequences into 8 groups based on their length and ensure the number of test user sequences within each group is the same. The larger the GroupID, the longer the test user se- quences. The experimental results are shown in Figure 8, where models with retrieval augmentation mention “w/ aug” otherwise “w/o aug”. From the results, we mainly have the following observa- tions: Firstly, it is surprising that augmenting user representations with retrieved memories is highly effective for high-frequency users. For example, on the 8-th group of the beauty dataset, the performance improvements of “w/ aug” over “w/o aug” are 10.96% and 18.67% in terms of HR@5 and NDCG@5, respectively. This demonstrates that even for high-frequency users, implicit memories may fall short of capturing user preferences accurately, while explicit memories can remedy this issue to a large extent. Secondly, we find the tendency of improvements w.r.t. different groups vary in datasets. For
