The main reason is different datasets have different preferences towards short-, medium-, and long-term memories, which also greatly affects performance (more details can be seen in §4.6). In a nutshell, the above observations verify that RaSeRec can alleviate preference drift effectively. 4.6 Study on Memory Bank (RQ5) To investigate the influence of different partitions of the memory bank on the model performance, we divide the memory bank M into three partitions according to the length of user sequences. The statistics of each partition are summarized in Table 5. For conve- nience, we use S, M, and L to represent the Short-term, Medium- term, and Long-term memory bank, respectively. For example, on the beauty dataset, we treat user sequences with length less than 3, those between 3 and 6, and those greater than 6 asS, M, and L mem- ory bank respectively, where the proportion of different partitions accounts for about 1/3. The experimental results are shown in Fig- ure 5. “All” denotes using all parts of the memory bank, including Conference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY Zhao et al.
