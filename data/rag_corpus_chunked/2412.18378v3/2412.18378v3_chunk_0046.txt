a too-big value (e.g., 1.0) or to a too-small value (e.g., 0.1) will significantly hurt the model performance. When alpha is high, implicit memories dominate the user representation, whereas if alpha is low, explicit memories dominate the user representation. The above observation indicates the user representation should not be dominated by one side, i.e., implicit memories or explicit memories. In a nutshell, we suggest tuning 𝛼 in the range of 0.3 ∼ 0.7. For example, setting 𝛼 as 0.5 will lead to satisfactory performance on the Beauty dataset. Besides, we observe that the performance volatility of RaSeRec generally increases as 𝛼 decreases. The main reason is that retrieved explicit memories are more diverse than implicit ones since the model backbone is frozen. In conclusion, we suggest setting 𝛼 at around RaSeRec: Retrieval-Augmented Sequential Recommendation Conference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY Figure 7: Parameter sensitivity w.r.t. the control coefficients 𝛼, 𝛽 and the number of retrieved memories 𝐾, where we plot the error bar with the mean ± 𝛾×standard deviation and 𝛾 is set as 500×the scale interval of the y-axis. 0.5 to achieve stable recommendation performance and relatively diverse results. Secondly, we can observe the results w.r.t. different values of 𝛽 on all three datasets following similar trends. As 𝛽 increases, the recommendation performance and the performance volatility gradually increase. Generally, 𝛽 = 0.9 or 𝛽 = 1.0 leads to the best performance. It demonstrates that augmenting user representation via modeling the relationship between user representation and the retrieved user representation (Equ. (9)) can produce more informa- tive and accurate user representation. We think the main reason is the model backbone learns to recommend items based on the user sequence instead of recommending users based on the target item. As such, users with similar behaviors lead to similar
