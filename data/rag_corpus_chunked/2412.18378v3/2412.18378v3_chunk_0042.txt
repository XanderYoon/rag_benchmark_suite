baseline models: (1) Non-sequential recommendation models (Non-SeRec): • PopRec is a non-personalized model based on the popularity of items to recommend. • BPR-MF [38] uses matrix factorization to model users and items with BPR loss. (2) Vanilla sequential recommendation models (Vanilla SeRec): • GRU4Rec [15] uses the Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU) to model user sequence. • Caser [42] applies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to model union-level sequential patterns for SeRec. • SASRec [21] models user sequences via self-attention mechanism. • BERT4Rec [41] applies the bi-directional self-attention mecha- nism with masked item training to model user sequence. • S3RecMIP [63] learns the correlation among items, attributes and etc. Here, we adopt the Mask Item Prediction (MIP) variant. (3) SSL-Augmented sequential recommendation models (SSL- Augmented SeRec): • CL4SRec [53] proposes item crop, mask, and reorder to construct different views of user sequences. • CoSeRec [29] propose two robust data augmentations (i.e., item substitute and insert), to create high-quality views for SSL. • ICLRec [4] first mines the latent users’ intents and creates SSL signals between sequences and intents. • DuoRec [34] proposes model-level augmentation with different sets of dropout masks on the model backbone. • MCLRec [33] designs learnable augmenters to generate views and applies meta-learning to guide the training of augmenters. D Metrics We rank the prediction results over the whole item set V and employ Hit Rate (HR) and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) to measure recommendation performance. Assuming the cut-off position is 𝑁 , HR@𝑁 and NDCG@𝑁 can be defined as: Conference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY Zhao et al. Table 8: Performance comparison (@10), where the best results are boldfaced and the second-best ones are underlined.
