space. AGAH [ 38] uses label information directly in its loss function, implementing a multi-labeling map. DADH [ 39] adopts a weighted cosine triplet-margin con- straint for ranking-based similarity preservation. 4 DCHUC [ 40] introduces a four-step iterative opti- misation process that allows simultaneous learn- ing of uniﬁed hash codes for database samples and modality-speciﬁc hashing functions for unseen queries. DCHMT [ 41] employs a dual transformer tower network and a diﬀerentiable hashing mod- ule, enabling location-aware image encoding and continuous, gradient descent-optimised modality representation. LDSAH [ 42] integrates label-wise semantic alignment with a dissimilarity-penalising strategy using a combination of Jensen–Shannon divergence loss and attention-driven sample re- weighting. Unsupervised cross-modal hashing. Unsupervised CMH methods use image-text pair coupling information to learn the modality hash functions, avoiding the reliance on category labelling information. This makes unsupervised CMH methods more analogous to typical FG methods, which also do not rely on labelling. Unsupervised UGACH [ 43] uses GANs to exploit the underlying manifold structure of cross- modal data with a max-margin ranking loss. UDCMH [ 44] constructs self-taught deep hash functions by minimising quantisation errors while preserving nearest and farthest neighbourhood relationships. DJSRH [ 45] uses a joint seman- tics aﬃnity matrix to combine neighbourhood relations from diﬀerent modalities for improved quantisation and batch-wise training eﬃciency. DSAH [ 46] employs a semantic-alignment loss function with auto-encoder-based hash code generation. JDSH [ 47] proposes a similarity decision and weighting approach which uses a threshold-based weighting scheme to increase the discrimination of hash codes. DGCPN [ 40] uses a graph-based framework with nodes representing related data and employs a conditional proba- bility model to evaluate the coherence between neighbouring nodes. ADV [ 48] adopts ﬁne-grained learning objectives for a two-step instance-level retrieval task where shorter hash code embeddings perform initial screening for subsequent reranking
