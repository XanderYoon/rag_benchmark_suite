Results are reported as Recall@k (k=1,5,10) fo r both (i → t) and (t → i) tasks. Models are grouped into three categories: Vision-Language Pre-t rained Fine-grained (VLP FG) models, non-pretrained Fine-Grained (FG) models, and Coarse-Grained (C G) models. BLIP-2 and X-VLM are additionally evaluated in a no-fusion (NF) conﬁguration. ADV was only evaluated on Flickr30K due to the required model-speciﬁc dataset preprocessing ﬁles for MS-CO CO being unavailable 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 R ecall 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 P r ecision BLIP -2 (NF) BEIT -3 X - VLM(NF) V iL T IMR AM VSRN SCAN AD V(2048bit) AD V(64bit) UCCH D ADH (a) MS-COCO Image → Text 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 R
