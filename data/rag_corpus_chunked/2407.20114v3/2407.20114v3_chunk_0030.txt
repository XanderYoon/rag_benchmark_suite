The experiments were con- ducted using the following four indexes: Indexes. IndexFlatIP is a continuous- embedding brute-force index that exhaustively searches the entire dataset via inner product and serves as our baseline for evaluating the performance of the other three indexes against it. IndexHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) is a graph-based index that organises vectors in a hierarchical structure and is the preferred index under F AISS guidelines for con- tinuous embedding ANNS, given enough memory. IndexBinaryFlat is the exhaustive search index for binary vectors which computes the Hamming distance between all query and retrieval hash codes. IndexBinaryIVF (Inverted File System) is a partitioning-based index that divides the dataset into multiple inverted lists and is the preferred binary embedding ANNS index. Dataset. The experiments were conducted using the SyntheticDataset class provided by F AISS. The choice of embedding sizes within these experiments aimed to exploit the strengths of diﬀerent granularity levels. For CG embeddings, a bit hash length of 64 was chosen to maxi- mize eﬃciency based on previous experiments. For FG embeddings, a 2048-dimensional embed- ding, similar to VSRN, was selected to maximize accuracy. From Table 7 and Figure 4, the following observations can be made: Index recall performance. The HNSW index demonstrates high recall performance, maintaining 98% of the recall relative to an exhaustive search in the 1M queries/5M retrieval candidates test case across all reported R@k scores 13 100K Queries/500K Candidates R@1 R@100 R@1000 Index Search FG Flat 2048D Baseline (100.0) 1.93s 57.17s FG HNSW
