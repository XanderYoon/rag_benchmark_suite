FG search uses continuous embeddings, aiming to ﬁnd the retrieval sample that speciﬁcally corresponds to the query sample. Under evaluation conditions, this involves ﬁndin g the retrieval sample with the same ID as the query sample. CG search employs bitwise hash codes t o ﬁnd retrieval samples that are more broadly relevant to the query instead of exact matches. Dur ing evaluation, this involves ﬁnding any retrieval sample with at least one matching category label relat ive to the query’s relevant category labels. The broader search criteria of CG search allows for more eﬃc ient computational costs, as seen in the comparison of encoding time and embedding storage costs of tw o representative FG and CG models (IMRAM [ 9] and UCCH [ 10]) feature representations from image-text pairs dur- ing training. Establishing the joint space enables retrieval across modalities, where the relative dis- tance of items in the shared space determines their relevance. While FG methods share the same fun- damental principles as CG ones, they diﬀer in the level of scrutiny with which the processed
