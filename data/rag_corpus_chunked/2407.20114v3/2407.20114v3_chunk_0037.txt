or identifying the most suitable CG architecture for real-world use cases. Additional experiments could examine the generalisability of our ﬁndings across diﬀer- ent data distributions, application domains, and model sensitivity to diﬀerent types of data. Fur- ther eﬃciency gains could be achieved through hardware optimisations and custom batching solu- tions. 7 Conclusion While the conceptual diﬀerences in performance between FG and CG image-text retrieval models are well-documented in the literature, empiri- cal data quantifying these diﬀerences has been sparse. This study introduced the library and toolkit FiCo-ITR, which provides a standardised toolkit for evaluating both FG and CG image-text retrieval models, which addresses this empirical gap. The results within this paper indicate that while FG methods excel in instance-level retrieval, CG approaches demonstrate competitive perfor- mance in category-level tasks where a large num- ber of relevant samples must be retrieved. Despite the potential for computational eﬃciency oﬀered by CG models, practical evaluations showed com- parable query latencies between FG continuous embeddings and CG bitwise hash code embed- dings, highlighting the practical impact of recent hardware optimisations. These results highlight that the notion of FG models oﬀering more robust retrieval performance while CG models are more eﬃcient is not straightforward; instead, these char- acteristics depend on the speciﬁc retrieval task and implementation. Future work will focus on two key areas: First, the development of a large- scale image-text retrieval benchmark to enable scalability experiments on real data. Second, the exploration of hybrid coarse-to-ﬁne approaches that leverage insights from this study to bal- ance retrieval performance and eﬃciency. These directions aim to further bridge the gap between FG and CG methodologies, potentially leading to more robust and scalable image-text retrieval systems. Declarations Code availability .
