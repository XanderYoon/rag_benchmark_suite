The HNSW index demonstrates high recall performance, maintaining 98% of the recall relative to an exhaustive search in the 1M queries/5M retrieval candidates test case across all reported R@k scores 13 100K Queries/500K Candidates R@1 R@100 R@1000 Index Search FG Flat 2048D Baseline (100.0) 1.93s 57.17s FG HNSW 2048D 99.2 99.2 99.2 32.44s 3.09s CG Flat 64-bit 10.7 60.6 93.6 <0.01s 8.84s CG IVF 64-bit 10.5 68.9 89.7 0.33s 0.70s 500K Queries/2.5M Candidates R@1 R@100 R@1000 Index Search FG Flat 2048D Baseline (100.0) 9.55s 1216.75s FG HNSW 2048D 98.3 98.3 98.3 154.29s 18.17s CG Flat 64-bit 8.2 62.6 89.3 <0.01s 181.83s CG IVF 64-bit 8.3 61.6 86.7 1.41s 11.13s 1M Queries/5M Candidates R@1 R@100 R@1000 Index Search FG Flat 2048D Baseline (100.0) 19.04s 4728.18s FG HNSW 2048D 98.0 98.0 98.0 300.65s 39.80s CG Flat 64-bit 6.9 56.1 84.3 0.02s 692.80s CG IVF 64-bit 6.9 55.3 82.3 2.82s 40.20s T able 7: Recall and search time performance of Fine-Grained (FG) and Coa rse-Grained (CG) F AISS indexes on the F AISS Synthetic Dataset. The FG exhaustive searc h (FG Flat) is the baseline ground truth to measure the scalability of other indexes relative to it. The time for ‘Index’ refers to the construction time of the index.
