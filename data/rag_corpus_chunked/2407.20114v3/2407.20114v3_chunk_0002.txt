approaches. Despite sharing the same overarching retrieval task, the subﬁelds of FG and CG ITR have evolved independently with limited integration, leading to the following three major challenges: 1) Because of methodological diﬀerences between the two subﬁelds, obtaining informative quanti- tative results which are directly comparable is a non-trivial task. 2) Researchers in one subﬁeld rarely benchmark against works from the other in a comprehensive manner. Although FG and CG methods have been comparatively surveyed within the literature [ 11], direct empirical comparative evaluations of recent representative models are lacking. 3) Traditional ITR benchmark datasets such as Flickr30K [ 12] (1K sample test set) and MS-COCO [ 13] (5K sample test set) are small compared to real-world applications. Therefore, these benchmark datasets do not oﬀer a com- prehensive understanding of model performance on large-scale data, potentially skewing perceived retrieval performance-eﬃciency trade-oﬀs. The lack of standardised evaluation method- ologies and empirical comparisons between FG and CG methods has hindered the ﬁeld’s under- standing of their relative strengths and limita- tions in real-world scenarios. This understanding is necessary for informing model selection deci- sions and identifying opportunities for hybrid approaches that could leverage the advantages of both methodologies. To address these critical gaps, this paper makes the following contribu- tions: 1. The implementation and distribution of the FiCo-ITR library and uniﬁed toolkit that bridges the methodological diﬀerences between the CG and FG ITR subﬁelds. This contribu- tion addresses the challenge of establishing fair comparisons by implementing carefully selected tasks, datasets, and metrics that accommo- date the distinct characteristics of each subﬁeld while maintaining evaluation consistency. The library is made available in the Python Package Index (PyPI) and GitHub, enabling researchers to conduct standardised evaluations across both subﬁelds, facilitating more informed com- parisons and potential cross-pollination of ideas between the two approaches. 2.
