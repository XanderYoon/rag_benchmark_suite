In contrast, binarising the embeddings to CG representations signiﬁcantly impacts per- formance: For the 1M/5M test case, the CG approach retains only 6.9% of R@1 performance compared to the exhaustive FG search. However, this retention improves at higher recall levels, reaching 84.3% for R@1000 (Figure 4). After the initial performance drop due to binarisation, fur- ther indexing these CG embeddings using an IVF index results in minimal additional recall degra- dation. For instance, in the 1M/5M test, the R@1 performance remains at 6.9% for both ﬂat and IVF indexes, while R@1000 shows a moderate decrease from 84.3% to 82.3%. Search scalability and hardware impact. As visualised in Figure 4, when not applying any ANNS indexes, the CG exhaustive search IndexBi- naryFlat is a more scalable search approach than the FG IndexFlatIP. However, once the two embedding types are indexed by their preferred ANNS method - HNSW for FG embeddings and IVF for CG embeddings - their search times become comparable (Table 7). For example, in the 1M/5M test, the search time for the FG HNSW (39.80s) is similar to the CG IVF (40.25s). Despite the potential for computational eﬃciency oﬀered by CG methods through lightweight bitwise oper- ations, Figure 4 illustrates a practical overlap in search time between FG and CG indexes across increasing data sizes. This convergence in search time can
