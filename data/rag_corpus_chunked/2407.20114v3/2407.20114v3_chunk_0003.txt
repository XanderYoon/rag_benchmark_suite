fair comparisons by implementing carefully selected tasks, datasets, and metrics that accommo- date the distinct characteristics of each subﬁeld while maintaining evaluation consistency. The library is made available in the Python Package Index (PyPI) and GitHub, enabling researchers to conduct standardised evaluations across both subﬁelds, facilitating more informed com- parisons and potential cross-pollination of ideas between the two approaches. 2. A systematic empirical evaluation that quan- tiﬁes the trade-oﬀs between CG and FG approaches across multiple aspects of perfor- mance: Recall, precision, encoding time, stor- age costs, query-time attention costs and simi- larity search time. This evaluation provides the ﬁrst comprehensive empirical basis for under- standing the relative strengths and limitations of representative approaches from both sub- ﬁelds, addressing the current lack of direct comparative analysis in the literature. 3. Scalability experiments that evaluate model performance using incrementally larger retrieval sets, quantifying the computational costs of large-scale ITR. These experiments reveal critical trade-oﬀs between retrieval per- formance and computational eﬃciency that only become apparent at scale, providing practical guidance for real-world deployment decisions. Section 2 provides an overview of FG and CG ITR, highlighting key trends and major works. Section 3 outlines the implementation of the proposed FiCo-ITR library. Section 4 details the experiment methodology for the conducted evaluations. Section 5 employs the library to jointly evaluate representative FG and CG mod- els. Section 6 discusses the key ﬁndings, providing recommendations for the use-cases of FG and CG ITR. Section 7 concludes the paper. 2 Related works 2.1 Fine-grained image-text retrieval FG methods aim to map visual and textual infor- mation to a joint space where relevant samples are aligned at the instance level.
