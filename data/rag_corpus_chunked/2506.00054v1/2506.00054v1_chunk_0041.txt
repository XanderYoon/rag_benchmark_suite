RAG systems under realistic, time-sensitive knowledge conditions. 7.5 Explainability, Personalization, and Trust Calibration As RAG systems are increasingly integrated into user-facing applications, demands for interpretability, personalization, and secure behavior intensify. Future architectures should expose transparent interfaces for explaining retrieval decisions and generation provenance, while supporting privacy-preserving personalization through user-clustered retrieval, memory-efficient modeling, or differential privacy mechanisms. Furthermore, integrating retrieval calibration signals—such as factual salience, source trustworthiness, or hallucination risk—can enhance user trust and system accountability.
