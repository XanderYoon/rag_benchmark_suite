Manuscript submitted to ACM Retrieval-Augmented Generation: A Survey 6 retrieved lists, retaining only the most contextually valuable candidates for generation. Complementing these designs, an information bottleneck-based filtering approach [89] selectively preserves evidence most informative for generation. Together, these strategies advance decoding efficiency and context quality, particularly for long-form and multi-hop RAG tasks. Retrieval-Guided Generation: A third strategy modulates generation based on retrieval metadata, task-specific cues, or agentic decision-making. AU-RAG (Agent-based Universal RAG) [28] exemplifies this by using an agent to decide dynamically between retrieved and parametric knowledge across diverse data environments. RAG-Ex [ 62] perturbs retrieval context to analyze how variability influences model behavior and reliance on external evidence.R2AG (Retrieval information into RAG) [82] extends this by recursively reranking candidates during generation, dynamically prioritizing evidence based on the evolving answer state. In high-stakes domains, Confidence-Calibrated RAG [48] shows that document ordering and prompt structure affect output certainty, highlighting the need for calibration alongside factual accuracy. These architectures are particularly suited to domains where factual correctness, reasoning transparency, or structured output formats are essential—such as biomedical QA, finance, and enterprise workflows. While they leave the retriever fixed, many of their techniques are complementary to retrieval-side enhancements and can be layered atop other RAG variants. Section 4.2 further explores compression, reranking, and decoding control strategies in these systems. 3.3 Hybrid RAG Systems Hybrid RAG systems tightly couple the retriever and generator, moving beyond modular architectures to treat retrieval and generation as co-adaptive reasoning agents. These systems emphasize iterative feedback, utility-aware coordination, and dynamic control over retrieval actions, particularly in open-domain, multi-hop, and evolving knowledge contexts. We identify three dominant architectural patterns: iterative or multi-round retrieval, utility-driven joint optimization, and retrieval-aware generation control. Iterative or Multi-Round Retrieval: These systems interleave retrieval and generation across multiple reasoning steps, allowing for evidence refinement and progressive
