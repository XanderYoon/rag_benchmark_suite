Survey 21 that adjust depth, modality, and source selection in response to task difficulty and contextual cues. This calls for co- optimized retriever–generator pipelines that leverage reinforcement signals, uncertainty estimates, or semantic control layers to align evidence retrieval with generative intent in real time. 7.2 Robustness under Noise and Adversarial Conditions Despite recent advances in noise filtering and adversarial training, RAG systems remain vulnerable to retrieval per- turbations, misleading content, and corpus-level poisoning attacks. Future work should move toward retrieval-aware adversarial defenses that incorporate noise-aware loss functions, retrieval-type-specific regularization, and semantic provenance filtering. This includes evaluation protocols that stress-test systems against contextually plausible yet misleading passages and group-triggered semantic attacks, as exemplified by recent backdoor threat models. 7.3 Multi-Hop Reasoning and Structured Compositionality Many knowledge-intensive tasks require aggregating evidence across multiple retrieval steps and reasoning over entity or schema-level structures. Current models exhibit limited capacity for compositional inference or procedural synthesis. Future RAG systems should support multi-turn retrieval–generation loops, structured subgoal decomposition, and graph-augmented reasoning pipelines that maintain discourse coherence and entity consistency across long-range dependencies. 7.4 Cross-Domain Generalization and Temporal Adaptivity RAG performance often degrades in the face of domain shifts, novel schema, or temporal drift. Addressing this will require pretraining retrieval modules on diverse proxy tasks, developing meta-retrievers capable of adapting to unseen query distributions, and incorporating recency-aware document scoring. Additionally, the design of temporally evolving benchmarks and evaluation suites will be necessary to assess the robustness of RAG systems under realistic, time-sensitive knowledge conditions. 7.5 Explainability, Personalization, and Trust Calibration As RAG systems are increasingly integrated into user-facing applications, demands for interpretability, personalization, and secure behavior intensify. Future architectures should expose transparent interfaces for explaining retrieval decisions and generation provenance, while supporting privacy-preserving personalization through user-clustered retrieval, memory-efficient modeling, or differential privacy mechanisms. Furthermore, integrating retrieval calibration
