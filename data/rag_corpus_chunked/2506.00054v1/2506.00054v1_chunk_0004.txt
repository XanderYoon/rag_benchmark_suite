from a retriever or reranker. • 𝑃 (𝑦 | 𝑥, 𝑑𝑖 ): the probability of generating output 𝑦 conditioned on 𝑥 and document 𝑑𝑖, modeled by the language model. Variants of RAG differ in how they estimate and combine these components. Some use a fixed retriever and let the generator handle noisy inputs, while others jointly optimize retrieval and generation to maximize downstream utility. 3 Taxonomy of RAG Architectures To contextualize recent advances in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we propose a taxonomy that categorizes existing systems based on their architectural focus—retriever-centric, generator-centric, hybrid, and robustness-oriented designs. This classification highlights key design patterns and illustrates how different frameworks tackle the core challenges of retrieval, grounding, and reliability. 3.1 Retriever-Based RAG Systems Retriever-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems delegate architectural responsibility primarily to the retriever, treating the generator as a passive decoder. These systems operate under the premise that the fidelity and relevance of the retrieved context are the most critical factors for generating accurate and grounded outputs. Innovations in this space typically fall into one of three design patterns: input-side query enhancement, retriever-side adaptation, and retrieval granularity optimization.

Figure 2: Taxonomy of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems.This taxonomy categorizes RAG frameworks based on their primary architectural orientation—retriever-based, generator-based, hybrid, and robustness-focused designs. Retriever- based models are further grouped into query-centric, retriever-centric, and granularity-aware approaches, while generator-based models include faithfulness-aware decoding, context compression, and retrieval-guided generation. Hybrid systems are organized by retrieval dynamics (e.g., multi-round, utility-driven), and robustness-oriented models address challenges such as noise, hallucination, and adversarial vulnerabilities. This structure highlights the diverse innovations shaping the RAG landscape. Query-Driven Retrieval: A prominent strategy focuses on refining and structuring user intent before retrieval to maximize alignment with relevant corpus segments. This includes decomposition, rewriting, generative
