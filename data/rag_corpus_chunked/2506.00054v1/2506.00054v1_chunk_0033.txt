Across the surveyed literature, these studies primarily target retrieval triggers, filtering layers, reranking strategies, compression modules, and corrective mechanisms, offering empirical insights into performance, efficiency, and robustness. Adaptive Retrieval and Query Reformulation. Frameworks such as TA-ARE, FLARE, and IM-RAG demonstrate that retrieval adaptivity is central to long-form and multi-hop reasoning. Ablating dynamic query triggers (e.g., forward- looking or self-reflective prompts) consistently results in degraded factual accuracy and increased hallucinations, confirming the value of retrieval-awareness throughout the generation process. Filtering, Reranking, and Evidence Quality. Systems like SEER, CRAG, and Re2G show that context filtering, reranking, and correction layers significantly influence downstream performance. Ablations reveal that removing context evaluators or decomposing mechanisms leads to verbosity and reduced grounding fidelity. Notably, reranking- truncation co-designs (e.g., in GenRT and ToolRerank) outperform static top- 𝑘 approaches by improving answer faithfulness and retrieval precision. Compression and Efficiency Trade-offs. FiD-Light and RAGCache demonstrate that passage compression and caching can substantially reduce latency without compromising accuracy. Ablating vector sparsity or caching mecha- nisms (e.g., speculative pipelining or prefix-aware replacement) increases inference time up to 4×, underscoring the operational significance of architectural optimization in production RAG systems. Robustness and Security. Studies like BadRAG and TrojanRAG emphasize that security-focused ablations reveal novel vulnerabilities. Even lightweight retrieval poisoning or trigger crafting can steer model outputs, while mitigation strategies (e.g., summarization, distance thresholds) offer partial resilience but require further study. Synthesis. Ablation studies consistently reinforce that high-performing RAG frameworks are modular, with com- plementary
