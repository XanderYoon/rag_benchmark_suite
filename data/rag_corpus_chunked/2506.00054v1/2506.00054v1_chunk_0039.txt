Future RAG development hinges not only on improving generation quality but also on designing principled, scalable, and interpretable evaluation strategies that reflect real-world usage and complexities. To advance the field meaningfully, the community must prioritize the creation of standardized, efficient, and adaptive evaluation protocols that can serve both research and production contexts. 7 Future Directions As Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems continue to evolve, a number of unresolved challenges remain that limit their deployment in dynamic, open-ended, and high-stakes applications. These challenges span retrieval efficiency, semantic misalignment, hallucination control, generalization, and trust. Based on the synthesis of contemporary research gaps, we outline five interrelated future directions that represent promising trajectories for advancing the field. 7.1 Retrieval Adaptivity and Semantic Alignment Current RAG architectures often rely on static retrieval policies and fixed embedding transformations, limiting their adaptability to complex or evolving user queries. Future systems must support dynamically calibrated retrieval strategies Manuscript submitted to ACM Retrieval-Augmented Generation: A Survey 21 that adjust depth, modality, and source selection in response to task difficulty and contextual cues. This calls for co- optimized retriever–generator pipelines that leverage reinforcement signals, uncertainty estimates, or semantic control layers to align evidence retrieval with generative intent in real time. 7.2 Robustness under Noise and Adversarial Conditions Despite recent advances in noise filtering and adversarial training,
