metrics. Top-𝑘 ratio (ranges from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating better retrieval performance) is defined as the number of queries for which the correct performance has a rank equal to or better than 𝑘 among all performances of the piece for which the query is made. We use 𝑘 = 1 and 𝑘 = 2. Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) is defined as the average of the reciprocal rank of the correct item retrieved over a set of queries: MRR = 1 |𝑀 | |𝑀 |∑︁ 𝑖=1 1 rank𝑖 (2) where |𝑀 | is the total number of queries, and rank𝑖 is the rank of the correct item in the result list for the 𝑖-th query. MRR ranges from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating better performance of the ranking algorithm. We also investigate the impact of augmenting the train set with additional data from the MusicCaps and Pitchfork datasets (see Table 2). Despite reasonable performance of traditional models on the general purpose task of music retrieval using text input, there re- mains much room for improvement for expressivity-aware music performance retrieval. We observe (see Table 1, second row) that for the MTR model the mean reciprocal rank for performance retrieval on the Con Espressione dataset is only 0.46, which means the aver- age rank of the correct performance is greater than 2 (on sets of, on average, 5 performances per piece); in effect, this is similar to what FIRE 2023, December 15–18, 2023, Panjim, India Chowdhury and Widmer 1.0 0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 Mid-level Feature Value (Predicted from T ext) 0.06 -0.15-0.25 -0.14-0.22 0.19 0.00 -0.08 retrieved = Gould true = Gieseking (rank = 6) "floating, brisk, romantic, rebellious, fast, mechanical, boring" 0.16 -0.35-0.30-0.21-0.24 0.20 -0.02 -0.17 retrieved = Richter true = Gould (rank = 2) "mechanical,
