performance. The Mid-level Perceptual Features Dataset [5] consists of 5k song snippets of 15 seconds each annotated according to seven mid-level descriptors: melodiousness, articulation, rhythm stability, rhythm complexity , dissonance, tonal stability , and modality (or ‘minorness’). The ratings for the seven mid-level perceptual features were collected through crowd-sourcing. We use a model trained on this dataset as our audio encoder, and we refer to this trained model as the “mid-level model", or “mid-level encoder" in the following paragraphs. We addonset density as an additional feature according to [11] (this gives the best results in our case). Additional Datasets: MusicCaps and Pitchfork Track Re- views. In order to effectively train a model, we require a substan- tial amount of audio-text paired data, and unfortunately, the Con Espressione dataset is insufficient in size for this particular task. To expand our dataset, we look towards two sources: the Music- Caps dataset, and a trusted and well-known music review website, Pitchfork (www.pitchfork.com). The MusicCaps dataset [ 2] consists of 5.5k music clips from diverse genres with paired text descriptions 4 APPROACH We define performance retrieval as the task of retrieving a par- ticular musical performance from a set of 𝐾 performances 𝑃 = {𝑝1, 𝑝2, . . . , 𝑝𝐾 } of a musical piece such that the returned perfor- mance best matches the query 𝑄 = {𝑤 1, 𝑤2, . . . , 𝑤𝑁 } comprised of 𝑁 words. In our case, the query is a description of the desired expressive character of a performance provided in the form of text. Expressivity-aware Music Performance Retrieval FIRE 2023, December 15–18, 2023, Panjim, India For each query, the piece is known, so the search space for the system is the set of performances of that piece. This is arguably a hard task; the retrieval
