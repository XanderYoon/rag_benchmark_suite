The performer imbues a composition with their own expression and style, and the listener perceives the emotion or mood being communicated through the music by the composer and the performer [19]. Thus the expressive quality of performed music becomes an important attribute through which a musical performance is characterised [4, 15]. The present paper pro- vides a step towards building music retrieval and recommendation systems that are sensitive to this expressive quality of music. We aim to develop a system for retrieving a desired performance of a musical piece from a set of different performances based on a description of its style, expressive character, or emotion. This is an important problem when dealing with certain genres of music Permission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.
