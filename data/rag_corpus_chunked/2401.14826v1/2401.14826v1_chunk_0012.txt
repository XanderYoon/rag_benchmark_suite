Text and feature values relate to the performance identified by "true = ... " Table 1: Retrieval results using different audio and text encoders. The values here are for a model trained with both Pitchfork and Mu- sicCaps augmentation and no PCA on text embeddings (see Table 2). For the random baseline, performances are chosen at random.
