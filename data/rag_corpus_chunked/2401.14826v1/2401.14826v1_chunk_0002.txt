in C Major" Text-based music retrieval system Renditions/Performances of Bach's Prelude in C Major Figure 1: A system for retrieving the best-matching performance of a musical piece based on a text description of its expressive character. such as Western classical music, where we typically have several renditions of compositions performed by different artists1, and pos- sibly very distinguishing listeners. These interpretations, while all representing the same musical content (piece), could vary subtly or vastly in their expressive character, and traditional recommen- dation and retrieval algorithms are not designed to be sensitive to such performance characteristics. In our work, we look at text-based music retrieval. Formally, given a set of 𝐾 performances 𝑃 = {𝑝1, 𝑝2, . . . , 𝑝𝐾 } of a musical piece and a query 𝑄 = {𝑤 1, 𝑤2, . . . , 𝑤𝑁 } comprised of 𝑁 “descrip- tive" words, we would like to retrieve the performance (say 𝑝3, as shown in Figure 1) that we believe a general audience might con- sider matches best with the description. This is a highly subjective task. We thus evaluate our models on the Con Espressione dataset [7], which is a dataset comprised of different piano performances, by famous pianists, of a number of classical piano pieces, and asso- ciated free-text descriptions provided by contributors through an online questionnaire (more details in Section 3). In this dataset, we have on an average of five performances per piece, which thereby constitute the search space for each query. The assumption here is that we already know the piece (and thus the search space for that piece) for each query, and we want to retrieve the closest matching performance in terms of its expressive character. Inferring the piece itself from the query, while a necessary component of an end-to-end retrieval system,
