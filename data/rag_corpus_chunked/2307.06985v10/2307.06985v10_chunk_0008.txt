size for all population sizes, it could be corrected for a specific population size as follows. 𝑆ᇱ= 𝑆 1 +𝑆 𝑁 (2) Where 𝑆’ is the corrected sample size according to the population size 𝑁. For the population size of 4,826,485, applying typical inputs such as 95% confidence and 5% error, the sample size turns out to be 385 that is quite small. Upon multiple trials, we observe a sample size of 4,141 for 99% confidence and 2% error. By proportionately sampling from each class with a minimum of one patent per class, the final sample includes 4,205 patents. To gather one paragraph from each document section of each patent in the sample, we use the Beautiful Soup library18 and scrape the web documents given in Google Patents19. From these paragraphs, we retain sentences within 100 words (approximately 200+ transformer-based tokens). The scraped text from the sample includes 51,232 sentences. To identify facts from the scraped text as illustrated in Table 1, we develop and utilise a web-based tagging interface3 that allows interactive recording of facts. Prior to identifying facts, in the interface, we discard the patent document sections20 that do not reflect artefact-specific knowledge, e.g., background, examples, drawing descriptions etc. We also discover undesirable lexical and syntactic characteristics, e.g., the occurrence of “.” in “FIG. 2”, “mg.”, and “%.” causing line breaks, and text within braces (.), [.], {.}, <.> that detection of noun-phrases and syntactic dependencies. As identifying facts requires a deep understanding of entities and relationships from an engineering design perspective, this task could not be outsourced to laypersons and was primarily carried out by an engineering design scholar, harnessing intermittent guidance from more experienced scholars in design theory, data-driven design, and NLP techniques. We provide over 120 examples of sentences (with facts) from the dataset externally21,
