Provide a technical description of the causes and solutions of airflow noise issue in fan systems based on the following context. airflow path :: configured to attenuate :: noise airflow :: is guided by :: noise reduction plate unique radial arrangement :: serves to reduce :: airflow noise outer end :: extends to reduce :: airflow noise sound absorbing material :: for absorbing :: airflow noise… Response: Airflow noise in fan systems primarily emerges from turbulence, blade tip interactions, and airflow separations. Serpentine airflow paths and noise reduction plates play pivotal roles in diminishing especially high-frequency noises by structuring the airflow to pass through carefully designed routes that attenuate sound. Integrating airflow silencing apparatuses, such as those using sound-absorbing materials or unique radial arrangements, effectively curtails noise production. Motor fan assemblies that feature improved airflow properties also reduce fan noise concurrently with cooling efficiency. Advanced methods like plasma airflow control and airflow recirculation are employed to manage and lower noise levels. Essentially, by reconfiguring airflow passages and introducing noise-reduction-focused components, these systems achieve quieter operation while maintaining desirable airflow characteristics. The solutions communicated in Scenario 3 could be traced to the patents through the interactive knowledge graph48 shown in Figure 6 that also uncovers other solutions like plasma airflow control49. To gather the 141 facts, we first obtain 164 facts that include the words “airflow” and “noise” in either of the entities. Using the sentence IDs of these facts, we retrieve 1,131 facts from all sentences and then converge to 141 facts that directly expand from the initial set. The availability of domain knowledge in the form of explicit facts allows us to employ these heuristics and thus enable RAG. The traceability of LLM responses to explicit facts and then to actual patents could ensure the trustworthiness of
