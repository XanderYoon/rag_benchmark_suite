that mention “airflow” and “noise”. Since the context is significantly long, the summary generated by LLM lacks traceability. In addition, the statements within the summary seem to infer noise reduction as an effect of other phenomena like airflow circulation and volume. - In Scenario 3, Table 6, when 141 selected facts are provided as reference, LLM generates a much clearer response, indicating direct and specific solutions like serpentine flow path44, noise reduction plate45, sound absorbing material46, and unique radial arrangement47. Table 6: Using LLMs for retrieving specific knowledge of issues. Scenario 1 Instructions: The output should be a single paragraph within 100 words. Provide a technical description of the causes and solutions of airflow noise issue in fan systems. Response: Airflow noise in fan systems primarily results from turbulence and obstruction interactions within the airflow path. When air moves past or through fan blades, disturbances such as vortices and flow separation can generate unwanted noise. Key contributors include impeller design, blade shape, and the surface roughness of components. Obstructions like grilles or poorly aligned ducts exacerbate turbulence, increasing noise levels. Solutions to mitigate this involve optimizing blade geometry using computational fluid dynamics to smooth airflow transitions, lining ducts with sound-dampening materials, and ensuring component alignment to minimize airflow disruptions. Additionally, the use of quieter, more efficient fans with variable speed controls can adapt to different airflow requirements while reducing noise output. Scenario 2 Instructions: The context includes a list of sentences. The output should be a single paragraph within 100 words. Provide a technical description of the causes and solutions of airflow noise issue in fan systems based on the following context. …the vortex generators 600 may reduce noise caused in the propeller fan… …the present invention to provide a motor fan assembly with improved airflow and noise reduction properties…
