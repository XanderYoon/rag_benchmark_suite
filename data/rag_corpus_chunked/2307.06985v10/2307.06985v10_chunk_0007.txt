knowledge from patent documents that provide standard artefact descriptions for over 8 million artefacts granted by USPTO as of 2024. In our earlier work, we attempted to identify facts from patent claims using a simple rule-based approach (Siddharth et al., 2021). In this paper, we report an advanced, data-driven approach to populate facts from entire descriptions (not just claims). 3. Method 3.1. Dataset. Patents have several classifications (refer to CPC scheme15) and explain artefacts at different levels in detail in each section (refer to example patent16). To create a dataset for extracting facts, we sample sentences from USPTO considering these two variations. First, we gather a sample of 4,205 patents stratified according to 3-digit classes (e.g., F17 - Storing or Distributing Gases or Liquids) in the CPC scheme. Second, we scrape one paragraph from each document section from each patent in the sample. To gather the sample of patents, we acquire metadata of 7.9 million patents from PatentsView17 (accessed on Jan 10, 2022). Upon filtering utility patents and integrating domain information, we obtain over 4.8 million patents from which we select an appropriate sample. We use Cochran’s (1977) formula for sample size calculation as follows. 𝑆=𝑍ଶ ∙𝑝(1 −𝑝) 𝐸ଶ (1) Where 𝑆 is the sample size, 𝑍 is the z-score that varies according to the desired confidence level, 𝑝 is the proportion of the population, and 𝐸 is the margin of error. As the above formula returns the same sample size for all population sizes, it could be corrected for a specific population size as follows. 𝑆ᇱ= 𝑆 1 +𝑆 𝑁 (2) Where 𝑆’ is the corrected sample size according to the population size 𝑁. For the population size of 4,826,485, applying typical inputs such as 95% confidence and 5% error, the sample size turns out to be 385 that
