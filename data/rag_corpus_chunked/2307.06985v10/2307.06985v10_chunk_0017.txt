Application 4.1. Overview. The motivation of this paper is to present a method to populate explicit engineering design facts from artefact descriptions so that these are utilised to guide LLMs to generate domain-specific responses during prompts. In this section, as depicted in Figure 4, we demonstrate three scenarios of GPT-4 Turbo41 usage while retrieving generalisable and contextualised knowledge of fan systems. While Scenario 1 involves direct prompts, Scenarios 2 and 3 include references to raw text and explicit facts respectively. For this application, we recurrently apply our method to populate a knowledge base (summarised in Table 4) of over 2.9 million facts from sentences in 4,870 fan system patents under the subclass - F04D (pumps for liquids). As mentioned earlier, we make the knowledge base accessible on Hugging Face8. Figure 4: Scenarios for usage of LLMs in the design process, including RAG. Table 4: Knowledge Base of Fan Systems Number of Patents 4,870 Number of Sentences 603,184 Number of Facts 2,927,529 Number of Unique Entities 261,351 Number of Unique Relationships 115,782 4.2. Generalisable Design Knowledge. Design process occasionally requires exploring or communicating generalisable knowledge about a product domain (Luo et al., 2021). In this application, we ask the LLM to generate a technical description of the domain of fan systems in three scenarios as depicted in Figure 4. - In Scenario 1, Table 5, when LLM is consulted directly for retrieving generalisable knowledge of fan systems, the response includes general use case, basic components, usual types, performance parameters etc. Since this response is more “Wikipedia like” and less useful for design environment, it
