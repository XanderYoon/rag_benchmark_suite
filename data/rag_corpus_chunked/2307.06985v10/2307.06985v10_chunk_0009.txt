facts requires a deep understanding of entities and relationships from an engineering design perspective, this task could not be outsourced to laypersons and was primarily carried out by an engineering design scholar, harnessing intermittent guidance from more experienced scholars in design theory, data-driven design, and NLP techniques. We provide over 120 examples of sentences (with facts) from the dataset externally21, in addition to the representative ones indicated in Table 1. Table 1: Representative examples of sentences and facts. The entities are chosen from noun phrases (identified by spaCy Transformers) and relationships are selected from the remaining tokens given a pair of entities.
