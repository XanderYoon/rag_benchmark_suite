The present invention :: is directed to :: pharmaceutical compositions, we create a positive training example as illustrated in Figure 1. When a sentence with entities marked as in Figure 1 is given as input, the proposed method is expected to return “is directed to”. For a negative example as in Figure 1, where a pair of entities do not have an explicit relationship in the sentence, the proposed method is expected to return NIL. We process the dataset in this manner to populate 375,084 training examples. To train models using the processed dataset, we undertake two broad approaches as detailed in Section 3.2. 1. Relation identification – For a sentence with entities marked as in Figure 1, we fine-tune language models for token classification, i.e., to predict token labels (or tags) such as “HEAD”, “REL”, “TAIL”, and “OTH” among which “REL” tokens shall be retrieved as the relationship. 2. Relation elicitation - For a sentence with entities marked as in Figure 1, we also fine-tune language models for Seq2Seq or Text2Text generation task, i.e., to directly output the actual relationship between the pair of entities. 1.3. Contributions. Based on the research, as reported in this paper, we make the following contributions to engineering design and knowledge engineering literature. o We offer a new perspective of knowledge extraction, specific to engineering design applications and radically different from conventional knowledge extraction algorithms (as reviewed in Section 2.1). o Visually demonstrated on YouTube3, we manually identify engineering design facts from over 50,000 sentences by adopting several heuristics tailored to patent documents that are standard artefact descriptions. o Upon processing the facts thus identified, we provide an open-source dataset of 375,084 training examples (187,200 positive, 187,884 negative) that is accessible on Hugging Face4. o For the dataset as above, we also provide the
