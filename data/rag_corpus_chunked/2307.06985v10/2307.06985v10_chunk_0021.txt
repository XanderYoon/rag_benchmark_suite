systems are often integrated directly adjacent to heat exchangers to efficiently manage air throughput and cooling functions, optimized by motor housing that can shield vital electrical and operational components. To retrieve the 177 facts as represented as a knowledge graph in Figure 5, we first remove the duplicate facts within patents resulting in 2 million facts from which we identify the 30 most frequent entities (without generic terms like “method”) Among 3,301 facts shared by these entities, we select the most frequent relation for each pair, resulting in 177. The availability of a knowledge base in the form of explicit facts enables us to strategically select the most representative facts of a domain and thus facilitate RAG.

In a design environment, certain tasks like fault propagation require knowledge that is specific to a subsystem or an issue (Chen et al., 2022). In this application, we ask the LLM to explain the causes and solutions of “airflow noise” that is recognised as a common issue by the United States Department of Energy43. - In Scenario 1, Table 6, consulting LLM directly to understand the airflow noise issue results in speculative causes and solutions without reference to solutions and thus implementation details. - In Scenario 2, Table 6, from 4,870 patents, we retrieve 559 sentences that mention “airflow” and “noise”. Since the context is significantly long, the summary generated by LLM lacks traceability. In addition, the statements within the summary seem to infer noise reduction as an effect of other phenomena like airflow circulation and volume. - In Scenario 3, Table 6, when 141 selected facts are provided as reference, LLM generates a much clearer
