domain of fan-systems. We demonstrated retrieval of generalisable and contextualised design knowledge and how such knowledge can guide LLMs to generate technical and cohesive responses. Such an approach and the associated infrastructure is our tertiary contribution. The method shall address various limitations and consider future research directions as well. We would build knowledge bases and interfaces to conduct experimental studies on how RAG aids knowledge-intensive tasks in the design process. Such experiments shall also include comparisons against well-matured retrieval approaches that include text embeddings, knowledge graph embeddings, graph-based retrieval, and other common methods such as BM25. In a design environment, we envisage that knowledge graphs as in Figures 5 and 6 are continuously navigated and explored as LLM simultaneously generates summaries of instantaneous graphs. The integration with LLM is not quantitively characterised in the current work in terms of how it benefits comprehension and creativity in the design process (Siddharth and Chakrabarti, 2018). As acknowledge earlier, repeated usage of the method for all pairs of entities in a sentence could be computationally expensive when the application is scaled for much larger set of documents. The method should therefore consider model pruning or surrogate modelling techniques for future upgrades. 5. References Chandrasekaran, B., 2005.
