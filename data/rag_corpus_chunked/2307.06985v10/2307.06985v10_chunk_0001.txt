case-based reasoning (Qin et al., 2018; Siddharth et al., 2020). These tasks are typically supported by designated or hand-built knowledge sources like handbooks, patents, technical reports etc., (Quintana-Amate et al., 2015; Siddharth et al., 2022b). For LLMs to generate responses within the context of such sources, it is necessary to devise a method to extract engineering design knowledge from these. In this paper, we propose a method to populate facts from artefact descriptions found in patent documents. 1.2. Methodology. A fact is represented as a triple - head entity :: relationship :: tail entity. As illustrated in Figure 1, the engineering design facts in a sentence1 could be identified using explicit relationships that associate a pair of entities (noun phrases). The entities are various constituents of an artefact, and the relationships are used to describe its underlying structures, behaviours, and purposes (Chandrasekaran, 2005; Siddharth et al., 2018). For a given pair of entities (as noun phrases), e.g., “processes” and “Progesterone Receptor” in Figure 1, the objective of our method is to return the explicit relationship - “mediated by”. To this end, as explained in Section 3.1, we create a large dataset of 44,227 sentences and corresponding facts from a stratified sample of 4,205 patents granted by the USPTO2.  Corresponding Author. siddharth_l@mymail.sutd.edu.sg, siddharthl.iitrpr.sutd@gmail.com. Figure 1: Illustrating our approach for relation extraction. Sentences in the dataset may include one or more facts as illustrated in Figure 1. For each fact, e.g., The present invention :: is directed to :: pharmaceutical compositions, we create a positive training example as illustrated in Figure 1. When a sentence with entities marked as in Figure 1 is given as input, the proposed method is expected to return “is directed to”. For a negative example as in Figure 1, where a pair of entities do not
