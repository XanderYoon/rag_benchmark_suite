description of the domain of fan systems in three scenarios as depicted in Figure 4. - In Scenario 1, Table 5, when LLM is consulted directly for retrieving generalisable knowledge of fan systems, the response includes general use case, basic components, usual types, performance parameters etc. Since this response is more “Wikipedia like” and less useful for design environment, it is necessary to guide LLM with domain knowledge. - In Scenario 2, Table 5, where textual reference is to be provided, it is not possible to input all 4,870 patents due to the token limits. We therefore provide the titles and abstracts of 10 randomly selected patents. In this scenario, the LLM locally summarises individual abstracts into short statements without offering a cohesive description of the domain. - In Scenario 3, Table 5, upon providing 177 recurring facts as a reference, the LLM’s response includes a cohesive description of a typical fan system, synthesising facts that represent generalisable attributes (“of”), hierarchy (“comprises”), behaviours (“rotatable about”), purposes (“to rotate”), and spatial arrangements (“are affixed to”). Table 5: Using LLMs for retrieving generalisable knowledge. Scenario 1 Instructions: The output should be a single paragraph within 150 words. Provide a technical description of the domain of fan systems. Response: The domain of fan systems encompasses the design, engineering, implementation, and maintenance of various mechanical devices used to induce or enhance airflow within a defined environment. These systems typically involve rotary blades powered by electric motors to move air or other gases, crucial for applications like ventilation, air conditioning, drying, and exhaust purposes. Fan systems can be differentiated by factors such to include axial, centrifugal, and cross-flow, each with unique aerodynamic properties suiting specific operational requirements. Efficiency in these systems is often optimized through careful selection of fan size, shape, motor type, and control
