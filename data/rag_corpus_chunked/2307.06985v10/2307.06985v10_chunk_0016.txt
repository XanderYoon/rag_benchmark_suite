0.009) and concatenate with one-hot encoding of parts of speech. The performances of these layers summarised in Table 3 suggest that GNNs offer poor performance despite capturing the whole sentence as a graph object. While MLP offers relatively better performance, its usage on external examples reveals that prepositions like ‘of’ and ‘at’ are always associated by RELREL and with other entities, resulting in various meaningless facts. Although link prediction incorporating syntactic dependencies is adopted in the literature (Jang et al., 2021; Sun and Grishman, 2022; Zuo et al., 2022), these appear less meaningful for populating engineering design facts. Moreover, this approach is tedious in terms of training and application, unlike the relation identification that offers a significantly higher performance while also facilitating scalable application as demonstrated in the following section.
