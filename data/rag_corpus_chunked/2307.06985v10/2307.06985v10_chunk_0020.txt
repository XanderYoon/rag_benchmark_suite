applications including ceiling fans, electrical cabinet ventilation, and vehicular mounts, emphasizing the versatility and continual evolution within fan technology domains. Scenario 3 Instructions: The context includes facts in the form – “entity :: relationship :: entity”. The output should be a single paragraph within 150 words. Provide a technical description of the domain of fan systems based on the following context. centrifugal fan :: comprises :: electric motor fan blades :: are affixed to :: upper surface air flow :: of :: axial fan fan blades :: extending in :: axial direction air flow :: generated by :: ceiling fan fan motor :: to rotate :: fan blade fan blades :: rotatable about :: central axis fan blades :: extending radially from :: outer periphery… Response: In the domain of fan systems, various types encompass several mechanical components and directional flows. Axial and centrifugal fans, powered by fan motors typically containing electric motors, encompass blades set in both radial and axial directions. The airflow is critical and may be directed longitudinally through different components and heat exchangers to facilitate air inlet and air outlet mechanisms. Central to the fan assembly, the fan blades—rotatable about a central axis—are crucial for directing air from the motor across the fan’s components. Trailing edges and leading edges of fan blades play significant roles in their aerodynamic efficiency, impacting the efficiency of devices like ceiling fans or cooling fans in gas turbine engines. These fan systems are often integrated directly adjacent to heat exchangers to efficiently manage air throughput and cooling functions, optimized by motor housing that can shield vital electrical and operational components. To retrieve the 177 facts as represented as a knowledge graph in Figure 5, we first remove the duplicate facts within patents resulting in 2 million facts from which we identify
