AR app we developed. The mobile headset weighs 566 grams and has a built- in battery. The see-through holographic lenses, SoC Qualcomm Snapdragon 850, are a second-generation custom-built holographic processing unit with 4 GB RAM memory and 64 GB storage. The users use the glasses freely without any connection to a power supply or external computing device. Built in eye-trackers allow us precise recording of users’ gaze trajectories. The app was developed with use of Unity3D 2020.3.20f1 and Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK). 4 U SER STUDY We designed and implemented a comprehensive comparative user study based on the between-subject with coupling within-subject factors. The independent variables were the tasks (within-subject) and the groups (between-subject). The study was comprised of two sub-studies (Study I and Study II) where the participants from Study II received the instant post-task feedback while those from Study I did not. Both studies I and II followed the same between-/within- subject design. Before starting the experiment, we conducted a pre-testing session where several people were invited to test the desired functionalities of the AR app. Some minor adjustments were then made to improve the visual and locational clarity, including the visual hint made into a more vision-friendly arrow, and our testing environment moved to a more spacious and bright function room. Figure 4: User study: The flowchart of the task procedure. The two phases show how the participants were engaged in the study. The first phase presents the prerequisite of the study while the second phase illustrates the formal searching tasks. 4.1 Participants We recruited 96 participants (different from the people involved in the pre-testing session), of whom most were from a local university. Their ages ranged from 19 to 57 (mean = 27.92, SD = 7.70); 54 vol- untarily self-reported male and 42 self-reported female. There
