undertaking the second task. This was used for identifying the exact role of the instant post-task feedback. The results were to address H2, as well as the usefulness of the instant post-task feedback module 2. Everyone was requested to search for different books in two different bookcases in the respective two tasks (Figure 3). 4.3 Task Procedure The duration time for the study of every participant lasted from 10 to 15 minutes. A short and concise pre-training session of book- searching was employed to get all the participants familiarised with the entire environment to maximally eliminate the potential accu- mulative learning effect among the tasks. The task completion time (TCT), which is defined as the duration from the participant initiates the searching until the book has been found, was measured regarding each task. The complete procedure for our study (including studies I and II), as seen in Figure 4, consisted of two phases: • The first phase started with the introduction of the study and calibration of the HMD. During the introduction, each participant was randomly allocated to one of the four groups followed by an explanatory overview of the experiment procedure by conductor of the study. If participants were not assigned to the control group, the roles of the audio or/and visual hint(s) were introduced and explained. Participants were then told to stand in front of the first test bookcase at a distance of one metre (a marker was stuck on the ground). Then they were instructed to put on and calibrate the HMD. Next, participants opened the designated AR app, and underwent the pre-training of a complete book-searching procedure without receiving any hints/feedback. They then used the floating virtual buttons for choosing their specified groups with a voice prompt: "xx groups is selected". • In the second phase,
