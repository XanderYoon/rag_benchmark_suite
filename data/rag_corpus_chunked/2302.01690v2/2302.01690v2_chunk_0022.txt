every task; in par- ticular, the members of the control group had a substantial lead in Mental Demand (mean = 72.67; SD = 7.99 for the first task; mean = 70.83; SD = 6.72 for the second task) and Effort (mean = 72.08; SD = 19.20 for the first task, mean = 74.17; SD = 16.81 for the second task). Since the NASA TLX values showed variance homogeneity, the 2*4 mixed ANOV A (p = 0.05) was performed to examine the TLX results. The study showed that all participants did not have a signifi- cantly different perceived workload (mean = 47.73; SD = 21.39) in the second task compared to the first (mean = 48.14; SD = 20.71), F(1, 44) = 0.052, p = 0.821. In contrast, there were significant main effects of the NASA TLX results among the four groups (F(3, 44) = 7.591, p < 0.001). No significant difference was found on the interaction between the tasks and the groups ( F(3, 44) = 0.182, p = 0.908). The post hoc test showed all three groups were signif- icantly different when compared to the control group in the both tasks. We conducted statistical analysis on the six indexes and Total Workload. However, we only report the results of Total Workload in the following parts of this paper since the significance found on the original six indexes can be referred to in Figures 6 to 9. The participants from the control group felt that there was significantly more perceived workload than those from the audio group (mean = 39.09; SD = 21.82; p = 0.002), the visual group (mean = 38.61; SD = 25.48; p < 0.001), and the combined group (mean = 48.19; SD = 25.58; p = 0.038). Similarly in the second task, the control group (mean
