incoming audio hint". ” 5.3.2 T ask Feedback Only the 48 participants in Study II experienced the instant post- task feedback. Most of them gave a positive appraisal of the gaze playback. For example, one participant commented: "The gaze playback was a good feedback since it displayed to me how I was searching for the book in the first task, which made me get better self-organized on how I tried to locate the book in the second task." Another participant told us: "the gaze playback was amazing since it told me do not look at other irrelevant places when searching the second book.". However, one participant also criticized: "the dot fluctuated so quickly that I could not follow and understand what it intended to tell me. It could be better if the gaze trajectory line was also visualized." Figure 8: First task in Study II: NASA TLX results of control (left) and three experimental groups.

Overall, both the visual/audio hints and instant post-task feed- back were regarded helpful by all participants. When checking the feedback given by them, we realized that the visual arrow and audio message were playing a dominant role in guiding the participants to the targets, which substantially shortened the task periods and decreased the workload. We also believe that after reviewing the gaze playback, the participants gained more awareness of how to perform and improve the book-searching task. 5.4 Findings By analyzing all the results from the two studies, we found that the TCT and task perceived workload reported gave identical results thus confirming our hypotheses. The visual/audio/combined groups all had a significant difference from
