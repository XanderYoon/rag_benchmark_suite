the prerequisite of the study while the second phase illustrates the formal searching tasks. 4.1 Participants We recruited 96 participants (different from the people involved in the pre-testing session), of whom most were from a local university. Their ages ranged from 19 to 57 (mean = 27.92, SD = 7.70); 54 vol- untarily self-reported male and 42 self-reported female. There were 48 participants in both Study I (24 males and 24 females, aged from 20 to 44 (mean = 26.28, SD = 4.64) and Study II (30 males and 18 females, aged from 19 to 57 (mean = 29.11, SD = 9.20) respectively. No participants decided to quit during the experiment, reported any forms of color blindness, or showed discomfort or rejection of the HMD used in this study. Each participant carried out the experi- ment independently and correctly. It is therefore reasonable to base our analysis and arguments on the data obtained. The whole study (including I and II) was executed in a bright and spacious function room without any external distractions other than the two bookcases used. There were no additional noises affecting the participants during the whole experimenting process. The acoustic conditions of the function were satisfactory to ensure everyone clearly receiving the audio hint. Each participant was given a small gift for helping with the study afterwards. All of the data collection corresponded to the Covid-19 and ethical rules of the authors’ home universities. 4.2 Experiment Design The participants (n=96) were randomly sorted into Study I and Study II (n=48 in each) and again randomly and evenly distributed in four groups in both studies: control, audio, visual, and the combined groups (n=12 in each). The only variation among the groups was the hint difference. We utilized identical settings in the two sub-studies; however, all the groups
