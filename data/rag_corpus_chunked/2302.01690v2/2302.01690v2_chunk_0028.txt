All the indexes including Total Workload in every group showed considerable decrease for the second task (H2). 5.3 Summary of Qualitative Analysis 5.3.1 Hints Most participants expressed compliments for both the visual and audio hints in the process of searching the books with the AR glasses mounted.

One participant from the audio group in Study I reported: "the auditory message was an excellent directive in leading me to the target shelf. It was a very
