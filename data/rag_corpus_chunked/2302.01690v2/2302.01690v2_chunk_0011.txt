features a "Visual/audio hints" component while "Eye-tracker" and "Gaze playback" components characterize another module. During the task period, the user’s eye motion is entirely captured by the eye tracker and simultaneously recorded. These recordings then act as the feedback for later self-reflection. After the completion of an assigned task, users can obtain data on the total time elapsed and then review the gaze playback to monitor their performance and make improvements for the next task. The central advantages of this system are the simultaneous visual/audio hints designed to enhance task performance, and the instant post-task feedback pathway which offers users the opportunity to make immediate improvements. 3.2 Book-searching Task The book-searching task was implemented with the aid of the pro- posed AR approach. The AR app encoded a number of book titles which were used as the stimulus in the study. The user with an HMD with a real-time built in eye-tracker would stand in front of the book- case, to find a specific but randomly determined book (Figure 1.a) after activating the app. In the beginning, users allocated in distinct sub-studies were assigned into particular groups. Depending on the settings, different types of hints with/without instant post-task feed- back were then provided. There were two identical book-searching tasks in this study and the gaze playback served as the feedback which was inserted between the two tasks. To precisely control the experimental variables while differentiating the task content, we adopted two congruent bookcases but with totally different books being cleared placed. (Figure 3). The books used for the two tasks are also distinct. The spatial layout of books remained unchanged and unmoved in both bookcases throughout the entire study. 3.3 Hints and Instant Post-task Feedback According to Arboleda et al. [3], visual hints can improve depth perception, which allows people
