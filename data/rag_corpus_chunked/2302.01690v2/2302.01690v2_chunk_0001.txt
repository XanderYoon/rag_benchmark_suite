mobile head-mounted display (HMD). The target case was a book- searching task, in which we aimed to explore the effect of the hints together with the task feedback with two hypotheses. H1: Since visual and audio hints can positively affect AR search tasks, the combination outperforms the individuals. H2: The gaze-assisted instant post-task feedback can positively affect AR search tasks. The proof-of-concept was demonstrated by an AR app in HMD and a comprehensive user study (n=96) consisting of two sub-studies, Study I (n=48) without task feedback and Study II (n=48) with task feedback. Following quantitative and qualitative analysis, our results partially verified H1 and completely verified H2, enabling us to conclude that the synthesis of visual and audio hints conditionally improves the AR visual search task efficiency when coupled with task feedback.

AR features the capacity to superimpose virtual context-related information onto the physical world in the form of graphics [35, 36, 61, 64]. This technology is endorsed and applied in numerous fields due to its capability of providing real-time interaction, as well as generating interactive interfaces of visualized digital content [17, 27, 62]. An emerging trend of AR is to deploy this technique to generate capability for conducting specific tasks. The visual search task in AR is a widespread research area which has received considerable attention, while the representations of it can be diverse, including visual element searching [14], real world object searching [10], or general searching [38, 45]. As a means to make the search process more
