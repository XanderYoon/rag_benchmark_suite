has investigated the combination of visual/audio hints and human gaze within visual search tasks within the same context. Another imperative aspect of AR is task feedback. At present, there is almost no in-depth research into involving gaze assistance for task feedback. It is crucial for domain users to obtain better task performance in many situations related to AR [9, 46]. According to Vieira et al. [51], task feedback has the potential to provide more specific information needed by the users in AR, which encouraged us to explore its potential influence in the same context. Here, we explore the effect of task feedback through gaze-assistance given that both of these have proven their efficacy in AR while there is an evident gap on the combination of them. Instead of real-time feedback [32], we adopted post feedback [43, 66] in our visual book searching context since it allows people to see their task reflection after a complete searching process [2]. The task feedback in our study is embodied as the playback of the human eye gaze recorded during the book-searching process, which is symbolized as an in- stant evaluation method. A vision-friendly colored dot smoothly following the path is used to display the eye trajectory (Figure 1. b). Specifically, the gaze playback component enabled by eye-tracking serves as the instant post-task feedback in our study design. It is noteworthy that no relevant research, to our knowledge, has studied the effect of associating visual/audio hints with instant post-task feedback in the same context of AR visual searching. By realizing these research gaps (combining visual and audio hints; task feedback and gaze assistance; visual/audio hints and task feedback), this paper proposes a complete AR approach for visual search tasks, examines the independent and the combined impact of visual and audio hints, and studies instant
