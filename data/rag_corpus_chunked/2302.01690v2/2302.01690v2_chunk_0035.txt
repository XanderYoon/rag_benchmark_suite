Other subjective ques- tionnaires could be utilized to incorporate more diverse subjective aspects, such as satisfaction and pleasure. Fifth, due to the perfor- mance sequence, the gaze review only influenced the second task in our study. However, in order to better understand the influence of gaze review on search tasks, there could be another design solution with a counterbalancing factor [5] where the gaze playback could be recorded from the second task then used for the first task. Finally, there is room for improvement in the AR app, especially for the design of the visual.audio hints. The arrow used in the current app was calibrated to the position of the HMD. Thus, the relative heights of arrows and the bookcases differed due to the different heights of the participants. As a result, an arrow pointing to a shelf might go slightly up or down. Participants in the visual group might perceive higher workload and spend more time aligning the arrow with a specific shelf due to inaccurate calibration. To address this, future work should calibrate the arrow positions with the bookcases rather than the HMD itself. In addition, the visual arrow used in our study led to advisable results but it might be too monotonous. Different design principles of the visual hints should be considered, e.g., not only the arrows but also other types of graphic representations which can visually guide participants. Furthermore, more options of the color rendering, the size, and the positioning of the visual hints should be discussed and compared to make the proof-of-concept more robust. 7 C ONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this paper, we have described an AR approach for visual search tasks with supported visual/audio hints and gaze-assisted instant post-task feedback based on mobile HMD. Previous research had given us an incentive to investigate
