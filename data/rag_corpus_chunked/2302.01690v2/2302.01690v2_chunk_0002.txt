is to deploy this technique to generate capability for conducting specific tasks. The visual search task in AR is a widespread research area which has received considerable attention, while the representations of it can be diverse, including visual element searching [14], real world object searching [10], or general searching [38, 45]. As a means to make the search process more accessible, it is even possible that HMD devices with the most advanced AR technology could soon become as ubiquitous as smartphones [40] to empower the search process to become more accessible. We investigated the specialized case study of a book-searching task in AR, which includes all the essential components of a visual search procedure: visual environment, a particular object (the target book), and distractors (irrelevant books) [48], and is easy to realize. When performing particular tasks in the context of AR, hints can improve the ultimate task performance. The type of hint, acting as a central and core tool, can vary. A widely-used tool is the visual hint [52], which is a mixture of graphical representations in AR with user interface (UI) actions associated with the physical world [54]. This effectively provides spatial and temporal guidance in AR. Another well-adopted hint is the audio hint, which presented as voice commands or directives can swiftly and clearly aid the user. A number of researchers have exploited audio hints for the purpose of informing, guiding, and directing within their designs [22, 42]. arXiv:2302.01690v2 [cs.HC] 14 Nov 2023 However, even though there is a substantial body of research into how visual and audio hints work in AR tasks, little has focused on search tasks other than exploring the combination of visual and audio hints in one AR framework. In our study, we observe both the separate effect of these two types of hints
