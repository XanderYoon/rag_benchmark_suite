Design The participants (n=96) were randomly sorted into Study I and Study II (n=48 in each) and again randomly and evenly distributed in four groups in both studies: control, audio, visual, and the combined groups (n=12 in each). The only variation among the groups was the hint difference. We utilized identical settings in the two sub-studies; however, all the groups from Study II received the instant post-task feedback while those from Study I received no such feedback. All participants (n=96) executed two book-searching tasks. For the control group, we did not offer any hints. The visual and audio groups received visual (the directive bright-purple arrow pointing out a specific bookcase shelf) or audio (the instructive and articulate voice message ("Please look at the Xth shelf of the bookcase from the top")) hints respectively. Finally, the combined group was given both sets of hints when performing the book-searching. The AR app was developed by incorporating the precise calculation of the inherent parameters of the bookcase (for example, the height of each shelf). The height of the participants did not affect the results since the visual arrows were continuously pointing out the correct shelf. The group allocation was employed for controlling the variables to verify H1 and the hints module in the block diagram (Figure 2). Each group in Study II underwent the feedback phase, where all participants were requested to watch their own gaze recordings from their first book-searching task before undertaking the second task. This was used for identifying the exact role of the instant post-task feedback. The results were to address H2, as well as the usefulness of the instant post-task feedback module 2. Everyone was requested to search for different books in two different bookcases in the respective two tasks (Figure 3). 4.3 Task Procedure The duration time
