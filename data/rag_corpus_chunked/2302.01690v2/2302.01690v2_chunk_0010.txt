et. al designed a system called YouMove which used itnteractive At mirrors to train users to record and learn physical movement sequences, where they employed post-stage feedback in their user study. Nonetheless, research regarding post feedback in AR is still scarce. Even though some researchers have identified the effects of instant post-task feedback in gaze-interaction embodied virtual reality (VR) [39], the gap of linking it with gaze assistance in AR is still obvious, as is the gap of combining it with visual/audio hints. Our study intended to fill the aforementioned gaps and open up future research directions regarding AR visual search tasks. 3 S YSTEM DESIGN 3.1 Outline of the Proposed AR Approach The proposed system, featuring an AR app, is an interactive tool for users carrying out a book-searching task. The equipment kit consists of a mobile HMD with built-in eye tracker which is responsible for recording the user’s gaze during the task being conducted. An overall block diagram of our proposed system is shown in Figure 2. There are two inter-correlated modules: the hints module and the instant post-task feedback module. The first module was designed to address H1, while the second targeted H2. The components "User", "The AR app", and "Task completion" are commonly owned by the two modules. The AR app is the core of the system which bears the necessary information needed for the book-searching task including hints and instant post-task feedback. The hints module features a "Visual/audio hints" component while "Eye-tracker" and "Gaze playback" components characterize another module. During the task period, the user’s eye motion is entirely captured by the eye tracker and simultaneously recorded. These recordings then act as the feedback for later self-reflection. After the completion of an assigned task, users can obtain data on the total time elapsed and then
