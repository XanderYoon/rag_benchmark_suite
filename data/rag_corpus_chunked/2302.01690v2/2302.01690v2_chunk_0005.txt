visual/audio hints with instant post-task feedback in the same context of AR visual searching. By realizing these research gaps (combining visual and audio hints; task feedback and gaze assistance; visual/audio hints and task feedback), this paper proposes a complete AR approach for visual search tasks, examines the independent and the combined impact of visual and audio hints, and studies instant post-task feedback through gaze assistance. Under the premises that visual/audio hints yield beneficial effects [3, 8, 23], so as task feedback [9, 58], through the AR book-searching task, we intend to test the hypotheses: • H1: Since visual and audio hints have a positive effect in facilitating AR visual searching performance and decreasing perceived workload in AR, the combination of these two hints has a greater effect than either does individually. • H2: The gaze-assisted instant post-task feedback has a positive effect for task performance and perceived workload reduction in AR visual search tasks. To examine H1 and H2, we designed a comprehensive between- subject [57] user study with a within-subject factor [7] followed by statistical analyses with the aid of a specialized-for-searching bookcase. The paper contributes: • Proposing an AR approach supporting visual and audio hints, as well as gaze-assisted instant post-task feedback for visual search tasks based on mobile HMD; • Exploring the effect of combining visual and audio hints in contextual AR visual searching; • Exploring the effect of instant post-task feedback through gaze assistance in the same context. • Exploring the effect of combining hints and instant post-task feedback in a same AR context. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes related work of AR with gaze assistance, visual/audio hints, and task feed- back. In Section 3, we introduce the details of our proposed AR approach. We also incorporate the particular use case of
