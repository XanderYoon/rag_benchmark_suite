two congruent bookcases but with totally different books being cleared placed. (Figure 3). The books used for the two tasks are also distinct. The spatial layout of books remained unchanged and unmoved in both bookcases throughout the entire study. 3.3 Hints and Instant Post-task Feedback According to Arboleda et al. [3], visual hints can improve depth perception, which allows people to cognitively better understand their spatial environment. In Wolf et al.’s work [55], animated arrows produced by an AR HMD were used as visual hints to assist dementia patients with navigation. We also chose arrows as the indicators, but showed them in an easily-recognizable color and in a static state. Since all virtual artifacts are displayed in the world space, users’ movements do not affect an object’s position. As shown in Figure 1.c, the bright-purple arrow floating in the middle of a shelf visually helps the user to locate the target book. This visual arrow is designed to appear within the users’ field of view, easily observed by users wearing the HMD. The arrow for the first searching task was positioned on the left side while it appeared on the right side, since the first task started from the left bookcase. Furthermore, the audio hint also plays a decisive role in guiding users during the searching process. Marquardt et al. [23] demonstrated that AR users can be guided with higher accuracy and within a shorter searching time by incorporating auditory hints. In our developed app, users receive an audio instruction about the approximate location of the targeted book. The auditory information is presented as a clear and simple instructive voice message, allowing the users to finish the task with higher efficiency. This message was merely given once at the beginning of the task to serve as the means of guiding,
