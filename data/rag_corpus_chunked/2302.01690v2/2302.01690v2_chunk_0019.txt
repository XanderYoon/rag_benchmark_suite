and "Stop task" to start and complete the second task using the same process. The sign of the book found in each task is when the user successfully visually locate the book by seeing its title, and then stop the timer orally. All of the voice commands given by participants to the device were recognized at first try during the formal study because of the quiet environment and they knew how to stop the timer by speech from the pre-training sessions. Finally, they were given a second NASA TLX questionnaire to fill out. All participants were told to unrestrictedly express their feedback after completing the study. 5 R ESULTS AND ANALYSES Below we present the results from studies I and II. All participants (n=96) completed the study successfully in finding the correct books at first try in each task with different durations. Thus, no tasking ac- curacy but the tasking time was harnessed. The dependent variables employed for assessing the tasks were TCT and NASA TLX. Figure 5: Study I (a: without instant post-task feedback) and Study II (b: with instant post-task feedback): The mean TCT (s) used per task by the four groups. Error bars show mean ± standard error (SE). 5.1 Study I: Without Instant Post-task Feedback 5.1.1 T ask Completion Time We first present the results according to the measured TCT of the two book-searching tasks conducted on task performance. As shown in Figure 5. a, the descriptive statistics show that in the first task the mean TCT for the control group (mean = 89.31; SD = 29.80) was much longer than for the other three experimental groups: audio group (mean = 24.83; SD = 8.37), visual group (mean = 41.76; SD = 17.10), combined group (mean = 46.51; SD = 17.04). Similarly in the second task,
