= 0.671. But there were significant main effects of the four groups on the TCT measured (F(3, 44) = 21.042, p < 0.001). No significant interaction was found between the tasks and the groups (F(3, 44) = 0.137, p = 0.937). The Bonferroni post hoc tests showed statistical significance between every pairwise comparison of the control group with all the other groups in both tasks. For interpreta- tion, the control group had significantly the most TCTs compared to the audio group (p < 0.001), the visual group (p < 0.001), and the combined group (p < 0.001). No significance was found among the pairs between the audio, visual, and combined groups. 5.1.2 NASA TLX Here, we report NASA TLX answers gathered from the 48 partici- pants from Study I on perceived workload. The descriptive statistics and visualizations of the collective data are shown in Figures 6 and 7, where the mean values with standard errors (SE) are reported. By observing the Total Workload (average value calculated from the six indexes included: Mental Demand, Physical Demand, Temporal Demand, Performance, Effort, and Frustration), we found that the values of this metric from the control group (Total Workload: mean = 66.67; SD = 17.42 in the first task; mean = 67.5; SD = 15.66 in the second task) were greater than the other three groups for both tasks. Furthermore, participants in the control group yielded the most perceived workload in every index upon every task; in par- ticular, the members of the control group had a substantial lead in Mental Demand (mean = 72.67; SD = 7.99 for the first task; mean = 70.83; SD = 6.72 for the second task) and Effort (mean = 72.08; SD = 19.20 for the first task, mean = 74.17; SD = 16.81 for the second task).
