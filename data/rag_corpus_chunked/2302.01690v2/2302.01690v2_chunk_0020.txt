descriptive statistics show that in the first task the mean TCT for the control group (mean = 89.31; SD = 29.80) was much longer than for the other three experimental groups: audio group (mean = 24.83; SD = 8.37), visual group (mean = 41.76; SD = 17.10), combined group (mean = 46.51; SD = 17.04). Similarly in the second task, the mean TCT of the control group (mean = 87.26; SD = 23.61) was still considerably higher than the other groups. Notably, the audio group (mean = 25.00; SD = 11.70) still had the shortest TCT in comparison with the visual group (mean = 42.72; SD = 25.36) and the combined group (mean = 44.26; SD = 18.71). Also notably, the combined group did not have an obvious TCT decrease compared to the other three groups in Study I. To identify the significant differences of the results, a 2 (task) * 4 (group) mixed analysis of variance (ANOV A) (p = 0.05) was performed given that the normality of the data was affirmed. This analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics, as were the fol- lowing statistical measurements. Bonferroni-corrected post hoc tests were employed to determine if the pairwise groups were significantly different. We found that all participants did not have statistically significant shorter TCT (mean = 49.81; SD = 30.51) in the second task compared to the first (mean = 50.60; SD = 30.61), F(1, 44) = 0.183, p = 0.671. But there were significant main effects of the four groups on the TCT measured (F(3, 44) = 21.042, p < 0.001). No significant interaction was found between the tasks and the groups (F(3, 44) = 0.137, p = 0.937). The Bonferroni post hoc tests showed statistical significance between every pairwise comparison of the control group with all the
