SD = 13.89), F(1, 44) = 45.344, p < 0.001. There were significant main effects of the NASA TLX results among the four groups (F(3, 44) = 6.049, p = 0.002), but no significant difference was found on the interaction between the tasks and the groups ( F(3, 44) = 2.387, p = 0.082). For pairwise comparison, the post hoc test showed no significant differences between every pairwise comparison of audio, visual, and combined groups in the first task. However, all the other three groups were significantly different when compared to the control group. That is, the participants from the control group felt that there was significantly more perceived workload than those from the audio group (mean = ; SD = 5.71 p = 0.003), the visual group (mean = 36.50; SD = 10.82; p = 0.001), and the combined group (mean = 45.83; SD = 6.97; p = 0.021). In the second task, the participants from the control group still possessed significantly more perceived workload compared to members of the audio group (mean = 32.00; SD = 6.69; p = 0.003), the visual group ( mean = 24.33; SD = 7.31; p = 0.02), and the combined group (mean = 21.83; SD = 7.36; p = 0.009). Nonetheless, the pairs of the audio-combined (p = 0.027) and the visual-combined ( p = 0.006) also revealed significant differences. That is, The results from the combined group are statistically different from the other groups in the second task. The result means the synthesis of the two modalities of the hints we tested worked better than when there was only one modal hint in the second task, where the gaze playback was provided as the instant post-task feedback in the same context. It is noted that the non-control groups had an obvious
