II are then presented. The descriptive statistics and visualizations of the collective data are shown in Figures 8 and 9. By observing the Total Workload, we found that the values of this metric from the control group (Total Workload: mean = 65.33, SD = 9.46 in the first task; mean = 46.83, SD = 7.03 in the second task) were greater than the other three groups for both tasks. Furthermore, participants in the control group yielded the most perceived workload in every index upon every task; in particular, the members of the control group had an evident lead in Mental Demand ( mean = 69.17, SD = 17.06), Effort ( mean = 77.08, SD = 12.98), and Frustration ( mean = 67.50, SD = 16.39) in the first task. For the second task, the differences were not as remarkable; Mental Demand for the control group (mean = 50.00, SD = 24.83) retained the high values. We noticed that for the second task almost all of the workload indexes, including total workload in the combined group were lower than the other three groups; the exception was Physical Demand. The variance homogeneity was once again revealed in the TLX values. Therefore, the result of the 2*4 mixed ANOV A (p = 0.05) showed that all participants had a statistically significantly lesser perceived workload ( mean = 31.25; SD = 11.96) in the second task compared to the first ( mean = 46.87; SD = 13.89), F(1, 44) = 45.344, p < 0.001. There were significant main effects of the NASA TLX results among the four groups (F(3, 44) = 6.049, p = 0.002), but no significant difference was found on the interaction between the tasks and the groups ( F(3, 44) = 2.387, p = 0.082). For pairwise comparison, the post hoc
