hints. In our developed app, users receive an audio instruction about the approximate location of the targeted book. The auditory information is presented as a clear and simple instructive voice message, allowing the users to finish the task with higher efficiency. This message was merely given once at the beginning of the task to serve as the means of guiding, and not repeated during the latter searching process to avoid being as the external noise disturbance. Figure 3: User study: An example scene of one participant searching for a book. a): During searching; b): Book found. The two congruent bookcases are used for the two searching tasks. The functionality and advantages of task feedback have been described in Cao et al.’s findings [6], that furnishing feedback in AR environments offers users more awareness of surrounding infor- mation, which ensures task efficiency and correctness. Appropriate feedback in a visually distinguishable form can alleviate their work- load and result in positive improvements in task performance [29]. In our study, the instant post-task feedback was provided as a visible playback of gaze recording. As shown in Figure 1. b, the user’s gaze was denoted as a brightly colored dot following the trajectory. During the book-searching phase, gaze trajectories were marked and recorded. After one search task, users then watched the playback of their trajectories, after which they proceeded to the next task. 3.4 Apparatus We used Microsoft HoloLens 2 glasses and the dedicated AR app we developed. The mobile headset weighs 566 grams and has a built- in battery. The see-through holographic lenses, SoC Qualcomm Snapdragon 850, are a second-generation custom-built holographic processing unit with 4 GB RAM memory and 64 GB storage. The users use the glasses freely without any connection to a power supply or external computing device. Built in eye-trackers
