56.98; SD = 31.59) was still considerably higher than the other groups. However, the combined group (mean = 17.95; SD = 6.36) had the shortest TCT in comparison with the audio group (mean = 22.91; SD = 20.89) and the visual group (mean = 26.49; SD = 12.51). This result differed from that of the first book-searching task. Likewise, after the normality of the TCT data was determined, the 2*4 mixed ANOV A (p = 0.05) revealed that all participants had significantly shorter TCTs (mean = 31.99; SD = 25.33) in the second task compared to the first (mean = 52.23; SD = 40.49), F(1, 44) = 13.421, p < 0.001. The results also showed significant main effects of the four groups on the measured TCT ( F(3, 44) = 14.390, p < 0.001). In addition, there was a significant interaction between the tasks and the groups (F(3, 44) = 2.844, p = 0.048). The Bonferroni post hoc tests showed significant differences between every pairwise comparison of the control group with all the other groups in the first task. For interpretation, the control group had the longest TCT compared to the audio group ( p < 0.001), the visual group ( p < 0.001), and the combined group (p = 0.001). No significance was found among the pairs between the audio, visual, and combined groups. Likewise, the second task also showed significant differ- ences between the control group and the other three groups ( p = 0.006 for the audio and visual groups, p < 0.001 for the combined group). However, we found that the pairs of the audio-combined (p = 0.001) and the visual-combined ( p = 0.001) had significance as well. The TCT of the combined group was statistically different from the other three groups in the second
