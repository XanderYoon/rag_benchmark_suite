other three groups ( p = 0.006 for the audio and visual groups, p < 0.001 for the combined group). However, we found that the pairs of the audio-combined (p = 0.001) and the visual-combined ( p = 0.001) had significance as well. The TCT of the combined group was statistically different from the other three groups in the second task. By observing the time outcomes from both tasks, we found that part of our H1 – individual equipment of visual and audio hints Figure 6: First task in Study I: NASA TLX results of control (left) and three experimental groups. Error bars show mean ± standard error. Figure 7: Second task in Study I: NASA TLX results of control (left) and three experimental groups. Error bars show mean ± standard error. have a positive effect in facilitating visual search task performance in AR – conformed to the obtained results. But another part of H1 – the combination of visual and audio hints has greater effect than either does individually in AR searching – was only valid in the second task. Furthermore, the time used in the first task (without instant post-task feedback) exceeded that in the second task (with instant post-task feedback) in every group. Hence, our H2 – Instant post-task feedback contributes to better performance in AR search tasks – was also reflected according to the TCT results. 5.2.2 NASA TLX The NASA TLX answers gathered from study II are then presented. The descriptive statistics and visualizations of the collective data are shown in Figures 8 and 9. By observing the Total Workload, we found that the values of this metric from the control group (Total Workload: mean = 65.33, SD = 9.46 in the first task; mean = 46.83, SD = 7.03 in the second task) were
