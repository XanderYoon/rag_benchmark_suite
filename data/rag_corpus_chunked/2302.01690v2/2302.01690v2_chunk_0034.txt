books themselves can serve as the variable elements. The thickness and order of the books might alter the participants’ search speeds and workload. The books we chose were generally thick ones, and the participants’ searches might have been sped up to some extent because the title displayed on the spine would be larger. Also, the books’ positioning may affect participants’ searching times since individuals can have varied viewing habits. A book put in the middle, for example, might be more easily noticed by people who are used to searching from the middle; a person who was used to searching from left to right might find a book on the left faster in the first task, while taking longer to find a book located on the right in the second task. Additionally, some books having similar titles might disturb and confuse participants which may lead to a longer or incorrect searching process. Nonetheless, there could potentially exist ambient visual or auditory disruptions (such as the objects except books on the bookcases and unforeseen background noises) that might have a slight impact on the participants. Third, the inclusion of participants of our study might not be sufficient. A more diverse group of samples could be considered in the future to strengthen the reliability of the research conclusions. For example, we did not yet consider incorporating non-binary or LGBTQ+ participants [53]. Fourth, we employed solely the NASA TLX as the subjective evaluation measure. Other subjective ques- tionnaires could be utilized to incorporate more diverse subjective aspects, such as satisfaction and pleasure. Fifth, due to the perfor- mance sequence, the gaze review only influenced the second task in our study. However, in order to better understand the influence of gaze review on search tasks, there could be another design solution with a counterbalancing factor
