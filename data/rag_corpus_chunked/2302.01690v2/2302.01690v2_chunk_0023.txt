the control group felt that there was significantly more perceived workload than those from the audio group (mean = 39.09; SD = 21.82; p = 0.002), the visual group (mean = 38.61; SD = 25.48; p < 0.001), and the combined group (mean = 48.19; SD = 25.58; p = 0.038). Similarly in the second task, the control group (mean = 67.50; SD = 9.25) had statistical significance between the audio (mean = 40.14; SD = 19.17; p = 0.002), the visual (mean = 36.81; SD = 19.81; p < 0.001), and the combined groups ( mean = 46.46; SD = 22.08; p = 0.02). Again, no significant differences between every pairwise comparison of audio, visual, and combined groups were found in both tasks in Study I. 5.2 Study II: With Instant Post-task Feedback 5.2.1 T ask Completion Time As with Study I, we first considered the results by TCT for the two book-searching tasks performed with the instant post-task feedback in between. As shown in Figure 5.b, the descriptive statistics also show that in the first task the mean TCT for the control group (mean = 96.14; SD = 49.43) was much longer than for the other three experimental groups: audio group ( mean = 27.50; SD = 13.87), visual group (mean = 41.23; SD = 19.65), combined group (mean = 44.03; SD = 25.89). Similarly in the second task, the mean TCT of the control group (mean = 56.98; SD = 31.59) was still considerably higher than the other groups. However, the combined group (mean = 17.95; SD = 6.36) had the shortest TCT in comparison with the audio group (mean = 22.91; SD = 20.89) and the visual group (mean = 26.49; SD = 12.51). This result differed from that of the first book-searching task. Likewise, after
