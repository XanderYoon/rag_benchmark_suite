We also believe that after reviewing the gaze playback, the participants gained more awareness of how to perform and improve the book-searching task. 5.4 Findings By analyzing all the results from the two studies, we found that the TCT and task perceived workload reported gave identical results thus confirming our hypotheses. The visual/audio/combined groups all had a significant difference from the control group in both TCT and NASA TLX, while the two tasks were significantly different when coupling with the instant post-task feedback. In addition, the combined group had significant differences with both visual and au- dio groups in Study II where the feedback was supplied. We believe the results obtained are representative and can be harnessed to verify our hypotheses. Thus, we rephrase our findings as follows since H1 was partially verified while H2 and was completely affirmed. • Even though visual and audio hints both have a positive effect in facilitating task performance and reducing perceived work- load in AR visual search tasks, the combination of these two hints has a greater effect than either does individually under the condition that there is instant post-task feedback. • Instant post-task feedback through gaze assistance has the capacity to stimulate better performance and reduce perceived workload in the same context. 6 D ISCUSSION AND LIMITATIONS 6.1 Insights What did we do and achieve in our experiments? We started from two core hypotheses, H1 and H2, with the purpose of discovering the effects of visual/audio hints in either single or combined se- tups for AR search tasks. We also studied the influence of instant post-task feedback in the same context. To resolve the assump- tions, we developed an AR approach engaging two modules of the hints and gaze-assisted instant post-task feedback separately. We designed a case study for a visual book-searching
