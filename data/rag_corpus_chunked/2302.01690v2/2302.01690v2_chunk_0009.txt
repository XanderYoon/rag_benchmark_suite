was satisfyingly performed from a low-level optical configuration. Three years later, Park et al. [30] pioneered a system which includes a Wearable Augmented Reality System (WARS) to examine their proposition on an experiment in which they selected desirable items in an AR gallery with content mobility. Rivu et al. [40] successfully demonstrated the superiority of eye-tracking, showing that users are more positive in concentrating on their ongoing conversations when there is more gaze interactivity under AR environment. All the relevant research proved that the gaze assistance in AR activates improved perception of people. 2.4 Task Feedback in AR Task feedback evaluation in AR has received compelling attention in the past years. A recent study carried out by Liu et al. [19] evaluated the influence of real-time task feedback in mobile handheld AR, which suggested that significant benefits will emerge if task feedback is engaged during the AR task. Zahiri et al. [58] studied the feedback in AR for supporting a surgical training, finding that most of the users preferred receiving the feedback while the task was being performed. Murakami et al. [25] found that haptic feedback as task evaluation can help users perform more effectively in a wearable AR system for virtual assembly tasks. Clemente et al. [9] demonstrated that continuous visual AR feedback can deliver effective information for the users in their sensorimotor control with a robotic hand, which has implications for amputee assistance in a clinical scenario. Anderson et. al designed a system called YouMove which used itnteractive At mirrors to train users to record and learn physical movement sequences, where they employed post-stage feedback in their user study. Nonetheless, research regarding post feedback in AR is still scarce. Even though some researchers have identified the effects of instant post-task feedback in gaze-interaction embodied virtual reality (VR) [39],
