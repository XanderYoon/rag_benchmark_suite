the trade-off between performance, cost, and latency. Furthermore, all interactions with LLM agents are managed through astructured prompt engi- neering methodologydesigned to ensure reliabil- ity and predictability [see Appendix B for details]. Our prompts are consistently engineered to include several key components that guide the model’s be- havior: • Role and Context Definition:Each prompt begins by establishing a clear role for the agent and the context of its task (e.g.,“You are a Strategic Intelligence Analyst. . . ”). • Task Specification:The primary goal or in- tent of the task is explicitly stated (e.g.,“Your mission is to determine if the provided evi- dence is sufficient. . . ”). • Guided Reasoning (Scaffolding):We pro- vide clear, step-by-step instructions, analytical guidelines, or few-shot examples to structure the model’s reasoning process and ensure con- sistency. • Behavioral Constraints:Explicit rules are laid out that the model must follow, govern- ing its process and output (e.g.,“You MUST follow this thinking process and output format exactly”). • Output Formatting:The exact format for the response is strictly defined to ensure a machine-parseable and predictable output (e.g.,“A single word: ‘Yes’ or ‘No”’). This robust, component-based prompting strat- egy ensures that the LLM agents perform their des- ignated roles reliably, contributing to the overall stability and performance of the framework (Liu et al., 2021). 4 Experimental Setup To rigorously evaluate the performance of FAIR- RAG, we conduct a series of experiments on chal- lenging question-answering benchmarks. Our ex- perimental protocol is built upon the standardized and open-sourceFlashRAGtoolkit, ensuring a fair and reproducible comparison against existing meth- ods. 4.1 Datasets We selected a carefully curated suite of four bench- mark datasets to assess the various capabilities of our framework, with a particular focus on complex, multi-hop reasoning where standard RAG systems often underperform. • Multi-hop QA:We useHotpotQA,2Wiki- MultihopQA, andMusiQue.
