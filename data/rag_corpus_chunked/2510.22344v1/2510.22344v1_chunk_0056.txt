methodology to decompose the following query. **User Query:** "{user_query}" **Constraints:** - The output must be a list of meaningful search phrases. - Each phrase must be on a new line, prefixed with a hyphen (-). - Queries must be in English. - Generate an optimized list of 1 to 4 sub-queries. Create ONLY as many as are **truly necessary** to cover all aspects of the original question. **Output:** (just write Optimized Queries and do not explain any more and do not say "Here are the optimized queries:" or something like that.) Optimized Queries: (A list of optimized queries) """ B.3 Evidence Filtering This prompt guides the filtering agent to assess the relevance and quality of the retrieved evidence chunks against a given (sub-)query, discarding ir- relevant, redundant, or low-quality information. PROMPT = """ You are filtering retrieved documents for a question-answering system. Your goal is to KEEP all documents that could contribute to answering the query. **IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES:** 1. BE INCLUSIVE: When in doubt, KEEP the document. 2. A document is useful if it contains factual information about the entities/topics in the query. 3. Even partial information is valuable (e.g., a document about Terry Richardson without birthdate is still useful for a query about his age). 4. Documents are only "Not Useful" if they are about COMPLETELY DIFFERENT entities or topics. **Original User Query:** "{original_query}" **Retrieved Documents (Batch {batch_number}):** {numbered_candidates_text_for_prompt} **TASK:** Identify ONLY documents that are completely irrelevant. A document is irrelevant ONLY if: - It's about a different person/entity with a similar name (e.g., Tony Richardson vs Terry Richardson). - It's about a completely unrelated topic. - It contains no information about any entity mentioned in the query. **OUTPUT FORMAT:** - List ONLY the document IDs that should be removed - If all documents are potentially useful, output: None
