significantly on complex benchmarks like HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018), which require multi- step reasoning or evidence aggregation from dis- parate sources. 2.2 Iterative and Multi-Step RAG To address the shortcomings of standard RAG, a significant body of research has focused on iterative and multi-step approaches. These methods trans- form the single-shot process into a dynamic, multi- turn interaction. One prominent strategy involves decomposing a complex question into simpler sub- queries. While frameworks likeSelf-Ask(Press et al., 2023) andSuRe(Kim et al., 2024) pioneer this decompositional approach, their strategies dif- fer fundamentally from ours.SuRegenerates a complete reasoning skeletonupfront—a static plan that cannot adapt to the evidence retrieved in inter- mediate steps.Self-Askgenerates sub-queries se- quentially, but each new query is largely informed by theintermediate answerto the previous one.In contrast, FAIR-RAG’s decomposition is neither static nor solely dependent on prior answers; it is a dynamic and context-aware process.After each iteration, our framework uses the Structured Evidence Assessment (SEA) module to perform a holistic analysis of theentirety of the retrieved evidence corpus. New sub-queries are then gener- ated specifically to target theexplicitly identified informational gaps. This gap-driven approach al- lows FAIR-RAG to adapt its evidence-gathering strategy in response to what has been found (and what is still missing), leading to a more robust and focused multi-step reasoning process than methods reliant on static plans or sequential, answer-driven prompting. Another popular approach interleaves reasoning steps with retrieval actions. This paradigm is ex- emplified by methods like ReAct (Yao et al., 2022) and IRCoT (Trivedi et al., 2023), which guide an LLM to generate explicit reasoning traces (e.g., Chain-of-Thought (Wei et al., 2022)), where each step can trigger a retrieval action to gather neces- sary information. The key distinction lies in the scope and triggerfor retrieval. In methods like ReAct and IRCoT, retrieval is typically alocal, step-wise
