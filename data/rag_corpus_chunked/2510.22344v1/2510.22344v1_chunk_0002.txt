complex and cannot be answered through a single-shot retrieval step. For instance, a query such as“Which movie, directed by the same per- son who directed Inception, won an Oscar for arXiv:2510.22344v1 [cs.CL] 25 Oct 2025 Best Cinematography?”requires multi-hop rea- soning (Yang et al., 2018): first identifying the director ofInception(Christopher Nolan) and then searching for his movies that have won the spec- ified award. Standard RAG frameworks struggle with such multi-hop queries, as well as comparative or analytical questions that require synthesizing in- formation from multiple sources. Moreover, they are not robust to suboptimal user query formula- tions and often fail to enforce that the generated answer remains strictly faithful to the retrieved evi- dence, thus perpetuating the risk of hallucination. To address these limitations, several advanced RAG methodologies have been proposed.Itera- tive approaches, such as ITER-RETGEN (Shao et al., 2023), refine the retrieved information over multiple cycles by using the previously generated output as context for the next retrieval step.Adap- tive approaches, like Adaptive-RAG (Jeong et al., 2024), aim for efficiency by dynamically selecting the retrieval strategy (e.g., no retrieval, single-step, or multi-step) based on an initial assessment of the query’s complexity. Other frameworks like SELF- RAG (Asai et al., 2023) introduce self-reflection mechanisms, training the LLM to generate special tokens that control the retrieval and critique pro- cess on the fly. Nonetheless, a gap remains for a framework that synergistically combines iterative evidence refinement with adaptive query genera- tion and an explicit, modular faithfulness check. Existing iterative methods can propagate noise by using entire generations as queries, while adaptive methods may not sufficiently refine the evidence needed for complex queries after the initial routing. In this paper, we introduceFAIR-RAG, a novel framework forFaithful,Adaptive,Iterative Refinement inRetrieval-AugmentedGeneration. FAIR-RAG is designed to robustly handle complex queries by orchestrating a dynamic, multi-stage workflow.
