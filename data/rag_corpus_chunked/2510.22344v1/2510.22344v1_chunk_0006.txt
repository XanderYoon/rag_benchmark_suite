framework consistently achieves the highest scores on the semantic metricACC LLM (e.g.,0.847on TriviaQA), confirming that its improvements reflect a deeper contextual understanding, not just lexical overlap. This robust performance validates the ef- fectiveness of our iterative, evidence-driven frame- work in enhancing both the accuracy and faithful- ness of LLM-based QA systems. 2 Related Work The paradigm of Retrieval-Augmented Genera- tion (RAG) has rapidly evolved from a straight- forward retrieve-then-read pipeline to more sophis- ticated, dynamic frameworks. Our work, FAIR- RAG, builds upon and extends several key research threads in this domain. 2.1 Standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation The foundational concept of RAG is to enhance the capabilities of LLMs by grounding them in external, non-parametric knowledge bases (Lewis et al., 2020). Early and influential RAG models typically employ a two-stage process: a retriever first fetches a set of relevant documents from a cor- pus based on the input query, and then a reader (or generator), which is often an LLM, synthe- sizes the final response conditioned on both the original query and the retrieved documents. This approach has proven effective in mitigating fac- tual inconsistencies (hallucinations) and providing answers based on up-to-date information, thereby overcoming the static knowledge limitations of LLMs (Huang et al., 2025; Guu et al., 2020). How- ever, this single-shot retrieval mechanism is primar- ily designed for single-hop queries where the an- swer can be found within a small set of initially re- trieved documents. Consequently, its performance degrades significantly on complex benchmarks like HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018), which require multi- step reasoning or evidence aggregation from dis- parate sources. 2.2 Iterative and Multi-Step RAG To address the shortcomings of standard RAG, a significant body of research has focused on iterative and multi-step approaches. These methods trans- form the single-shot process into a dynamic, multi- turn interaction. One
