Your task is to evaluate the answer's faithfulness to the provided evidence with nuance. - A faithful answer must be fully grounded in the provided context. However, this does not mean it must be a simple copy-paste of the text. **Valid synthesis, summarization, and logical inference based *only* on the provided information are considered faithful and desirable.** - A statement is only considered **"Unfaithful"** if it introduces new, verifiable information that is **absent** from the context or if it **contradicts** the context. [User Question (for context)]: "{question}" [Provided Context (final_relevant_evidence)]: {final_evidence} [Generated Answer]: "{final_answer}" **Your Task:** 1. Analyze each claim within the [Generated Answer]. 2. For each claim, determine if it is directly stated, a valid synthesis/inference from the context, or an unfaithful statement (introducing new facts). 3. Based on this analysis, provide an overall verdict according to the rubric below. **Verdict Rubric:** - **'Fully Faithful'**: All claims in the answer are either directly stated in the context or are valid logical conclusions/summaries derived *only* from the information present in the context. - **'Partially Faithful'**: The answer is mostly faithful, but contains minor, non-critical claims or details that cannot be inferred from the context. - **'Not Faithful'**: The answer contains significant or central factual claims that are not supported by, or actively contradict, the context. Provide your verdict in the following strict JSON format: {{ "faithfulness_verdict": "<One of three strings: 'Fully Faithful','Partially Faithful', or'Not Faithful'>", "reasoning": "<If not fully faithful, specify which claims in the answer are unsupported by the context. Explain if it's an invalid
