[User Question]: "{question}" [The Filter's Original Instructions & Principles]: The filter's goal was to identify and discard "Not Useful" documents. It operated under the following rules: 1. **Primary Principle:** **"BE INCLUSIVE: When in doubt, KEEP the document."** 2. **Definition of "Useful":** A document is considered useful if it contains factual information about the entities or topics in the query. **Even partial information is valuable.** 3. **Definition of "Not Useful":** A document is only "Not Useful" if it is about **completely different** entities/topics or contains no relevant information. 4. **Specific "KEEP" Criteria:** The filter was explicitly instructed to **KEEP** documents containing: - The correct person/entity, even without all specific facts. - Biographical information (birth dates, career details, achievements). - Relationships or connections between queried entities. - Specific facts relevant to the query type (e.g., dates). - General contextual information that helps understand the entities. 5. **Specific "REMOVE" Criteria:** The filter was given examples of what to **REMOVE**: - Documents about different people with similar names. - Documents about completely unrelated topics. - Duplicate documents. Your audit must strictly follow all of the same rules, especially the **"BE INCLUSIVE"** principle. [Documents the Filter KEPT]: {kept_docs} [Documents the Filter DISCARDED]: {discarded_docs}
