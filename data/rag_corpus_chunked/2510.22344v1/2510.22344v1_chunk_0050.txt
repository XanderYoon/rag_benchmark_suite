A Implementation Details and Hyperparameters To ensure full reproducibility of our experimen- tal results, this section provides a comprehensive overview of the models, configurations, and hy- perparameters used in our study. All experiments were conducted within theFlashRAGframework, a standardized library for RAG research. This ensures that the underlying implementation de- tails, such as data loading and prompt templat- ing, remain consistent across all compared meth- ods. The source code and default configurations can be found on the official project repository: https://github.com/ruc-nlpir/flashrag. The specific configurations for our experiments are detailed in Table 5 below.
