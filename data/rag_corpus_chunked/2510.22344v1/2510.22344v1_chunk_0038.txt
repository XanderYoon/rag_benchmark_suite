demonstrating FAIR-RAG’s two-iteration process for a complex comparative query. In Iteration 1, the system decomposes the query and retrieves initial evidence identifying the museums but lacking the required architectural styles. The Structured Evidence Assessment (SEA) module correctly identifies this gap (Is Sufficient: No), triggering a second iteration. In Iteration 2, the system generates Refined Queries targeting the missing information, successfully retrieves the necessary evidence, and confirms sufficiency. The process culminates in a Final Faithful Generation that synthesizes evidence from both iterations into a comprehensive answer. * analysis_summary:The initial re- trieval successfully resolved the pri- mary entities for both comparative tracks, identifying the Louvre Mu- seum and the British Museum. How- ever, the core ‘Required Findings’ concerning the architectural styles of these institutions remain unad- dressed. Therefore, critical informa- tion gaps prevent the synthesis of a complete answer. • Iteration 2: Parallel Query Refinement & Evidence Completion – Refined Queries:The refinement mod- ule now uses the entities identified in Iter- ation 1 to generate new, highly-focused queries for each track: * Refined Query A: [“architectural style of the Louvre Museum”] * Refined Query B: [“architectural style of the British Museum”] – Retrieved Evidence:The new targeted queries retrieve the final missing pieces of information: * Evidence A: “The architecture of the Louvre Palace is a complex blend of styles, from French Renaissance to Neoclassicism, famously comple- mented by I. M. Pei’s Modernist glass pyramid.” * Evidence B: “The main building of the British Museum, designed by ar- chitect Sir Robert Smirke, is a mas- terpiece of theGreek Revivalstyle, featuring a grand quadrangle and a portico of 44 columns.” – Structured Evidence Assessment (SEA): * is_sufficient: ‘Yes’ * analysis_summary:The refined queries successfully retrieved the fi- nal missing data points. All items on the ‘Required Findings’ checklist— the identities of both museums and their
