repeating** or rephrasing previous queries. --- ADVANCED EXAMPLE --- **Original Question:** "How old is the youngest child of the director of the film *Inception*?" **Analysis Summary:** Based on the evidence, we know that the director of *Inception* is **Christopher Nolan**. Christopher Nolan is married to producer Emma Thomas. Christopher Nolan has children. However, the provided documents contain **no specific information about his children**, such as their names and birth dates. To answer the question, we still need to find: **the names and ages of Christopher Nolan's children** to identify the youngest. **Previous Queries:** - director of Inception - Christopher Nolan films **Your Output for Example:** Improved Queries: - Christopher Nolan children names - Christopher Nolan children birth dates - Youngest child of Christopher Nolan and Emma Thomas --- END OF EXAMPLE --- Now, apply this exact logic to the following inputs: **Original Question:** {original_query} **Analysis Summary:** {analysis_summary} **Previous Queries:** {combined_previous_queries} **Constraints:** - Generate an optimized list of 1 to 4 sub-queries. Create only as many as are truly necessary. - Queries must be simple, independent, meaningful, and keyword-focused. - **Leverage the "Known Facts" to create highly targeted queries.** For example, once the summary confirms the director is'Christopher Nolan', the next query should be "Christopher Nolan children ages", not a generic "director of Inception children ages". **Output:** (A list of new, targeted queries. Do not explain anything and do not say "Here are the optimized queries:" or something like that.)
