While this module is a key feature for prac- tical deployment, it was systematically controlled during our benchmark evaluations to ensure a fair comparison, as detailed in Section 4.4. 3.3 The Iterative Retrieval and Refinement Cycle This cycle is the core of FAIR-RAG’s ability to handle complex information needs. It is designed to run for a maximum of three iterations to ensure a balance between comprehensiveness and latency. Each iteration consists of the following steps: 3.3.1 Adaptive Query Generation The initial user query, if deemed complex, is first subjected to semantic decomposition. An LLM agent breaks down the multifaceted query into a set of up to four distinct, keyword-rich, and seman- tically independent sub-queries. For example, the query“What were Alan Turing’s main contribu- tions to computer science and his role in World War II?”is decomposed
