3.3.1 Adaptive Query Generation The initial user query, if deemed complex, is first subjected to semantic decomposition. An LLM agent breaks down the multifaceted query into a set of up to four distinct, keyword-rich, and seman- tically independent sub-queries. For example, the query“What were Alan Turing’s main contribu- tions to computer science and his role in World War II?”is decomposed into targeted sub-queries like“Alan Turing’s contributions to theoretical computer science”and“Alan Turing’s role in breaking the Enigma code.”This ensures that the retrieval process covers all conceptual facets of the original question. 3.3.2 Hybrid Retrieval and Reranking For each sub-query, we employ a hybrid retrieval strategy to maximize recall. We perform both dense vector search (capturing semantic simi- larity) (Karpukhin et al., 2020) and traditional keyword-based sparse search (capturing exact matches) (Robertson and Zaragoza, 2009). The results from both methods are aggregated, and the documents are re-ranked using theRecipro- cal Rank Fusion (RRF)algorithm (Cormack et al., 2009). RRF effectively combines the rankings from both retrieval methods without requiring hyperpa- rameter tuning, producing a single, robustly ranked list of the top-5 most relevant documents as candi- date evidence. 3.3.3 Evidence Filtering The candidate evidence is then passed to a filtering module. An LLM agent evaluates each document’s utility with respect to theoriginaluser query. Doc- uments that are irrelevant, off-topic, or only tangen- tially related are discarded (Liu et al., 2023a). This step is critical for increasing the signal-to-noise ratio of the context provided to the final genera- tor, preventing the model from being distracted by Figure 1: Schematic overview of the FAIR-RAG architecture. The process starts with initial query analysis and adaptive language model selection (e.g., small, large, or reasoning LLM). For complex queries, it proceeds to query decomposition, followed by an iterative refinement cycle involving hybrid retrieval and reranking, evidence filtering, and
