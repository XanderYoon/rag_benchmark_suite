the “brain” of the iterative process, failures in the Strategic Evi- dence Assessment module are particularly im- pactful. These errors were significantly more prevalent in complex, multi-hop datasets like MuSiQue, HotpotQA, and 2WikiMultihopQA. The most common subtypes were: (i) Faulty Analysis of Evidence, where the SEA module failed to make a correct logical inference from the provided documents (e.g., misinterpreting complex genealogical relationships); and (ii) Premature Sufficiency Judgment, where the logic incorrectly concluded that the gathered evidence was complete, thus halting the re- finement loop too early. • Query Logic Failures (12.0% combined): This group includes errors from the initial query processing stages. Query Decompo- sition Errors (9.0%) were the most common, often stemming from an inability to challenge flawed premises within the user’s question (e.g., processing a query with a historical anachronism) or generating overly broad sub- queries. Query Refinement (1.5%) and Ev- idence Filtering Errors (1.5%) were exceed- Figure 5: Task-Dependent Distribution of Failure Modes. The analysis highlights a strong correlation between task complexity and the primary failure bot- tleneck. For the factoid-centric TriviaQA, Retrieval Failures are dominant (47%). Conversely, for complex multi-hop reasoning datasets like MuSiQue, HotpotQA, and 2WikiMultihopQA, the burden shifts towards rea- soning, with SEA Errors becoming a major failure cate- gory (28-32%). This trend validates the critical role of the strategic reasoning component (SEA) for success- fully navigating multi-step queries. ingly rare, suggesting that these architectural components are relatively robust. Dataset-Specific Error DistributionsWhile the aggregate view is informative, Figure 5 reveals that the distribution of failure modes is highly de- pendent on the nature of the task. For fact-based, single-hop datasets like TriviaQA, failures are over- whelmingly concentrated in the Retrieval stage (47%). However, as query complexity increases in multi-hop datasets (MuSiQue, HotpotQA, 2Wiki- MultihopQA), the burden shifts. In these cases, SEA Errors become
