a disjointed answer focusing on only one of the entities, or fail entirely. Why this query is difficult for other advanced RAGs: • AnITER-RETGENsystem, due to its inher- ently single-threaded nature, might success- fully follow one reasoning path (e.g., find the Louvre, then its style). However, it lacks the mechanism to manage a parallel track simul- taneously, causing it to lose the context of the second entity (the British Museum) and fail to produce a coherent comparison. • AnAdaptive-RAGframework may correctly identify the query as “complex.” However, it typically lacks a structured, multi-track decomposition process. Without the abil- ity to systematically pursue both information threads in parallel before synthesis, its adap- tive strategy remains insufficient for true com- parative reasoning. FAIR-RAG in Action: • Iteration 1: Semantic Decomposition & Parallel Initial Retrieval – Adaptive Sub-Queries:FAIR-RAG’s first action is to decompose the compar- ative query into two distinct, parallel in- vestigative tracks: * Track A: [“building that houses the Mona Lisa”] * Track B: [“museum in London that houses the Rosetta Stone”] – Retrieved Evidence:The system re- trieves evidence for both tracks concur- rently: * Evidence A: “The Mona Lisa is a half-length portrait painting by Leonardo da Vinci, on permanent dis- play at theLouvre Museumin Paris, France.” * Evidence B: “The Rosetta Stone is a granodiorite stele on public display at theBritish Museumin London since 1802.” – Structured Evidence Assessment (SEA): * is_sufficient: ‘No’ Figure 3: A qualitative case study demonstrating FAIR-RAG’s two-iteration process for a complex comparative query. In Iteration 1, the system decomposes the query and retrieves initial evidence identifying the museums but lacking the required architectural styles. The Structured Evidence Assessment (SEA) module correctly identifies this gap (Is Sufficient: No), triggering a second iteration. In Iteration 2, the system generates Refined Queries targeting the missing information, successfully
