2WikiMultiHopQA and83.19% on Musique. Its lower accuracy on TriviaQA (54.38%) is expected, as the sufficiency deci- sion for single-hop factual questions can be more ambiguous. These results confirm the module’s value as the central control mecha- nism for the iterative process, proving highly reliable when it matters most. It is important to note that a direct ablation study removing the SEA and Query Refinement modules and replacing them with a fixed-iteration loop was deliberately omitted. Such a stripped-down design, lacking adaptive control and explicit gap analysis, would cease to be FAIR-RAG and instead would conceptually approximate the architectural princi- ples of existing iterative baselines. For instance, without a targeted query refinement strategy driven by SEA, the system would likely resort to generat- ing new queries from the previous answer, a core mechanism in ITER-RETGEN (Shao et al., 2023). Furthermore, by removing its primary mechanism for evidence-aware self-correction, this simplified variant would represent a less sophisticated control strategy than that of models like Self-RAG (Asai et al., 2023), which employ reflection at a more granular level. Given that FAIR-RAG already demonstrates a significant performance margin over these strong baselines in our main experiments (see Table 2), our existing comparisons effectively serve as a val- idation of our adaptive, SEA-driven architecture versus these alternative control strategies. This confirms that the observed performance gains are attributable to the synergistic and intelligent con- trol of the SEA and Query Refinement modules, rather than merely the brute-force effect of repeated iterations. 5.2.2 Impact of Iterative Refinement A core hypothesis of this work is that iterative refinement improves answer quality for complex questions. We tested this by running the same set of questions with the maximum number of iterations ranging from 1 to 4. We then used an LLM-as- Judge to rank the resulting answers for
