the retriever, but the subsequent filtering/reranking step mistakenly discarded the crucial documents. Look for correct information in`[Discarded Documents]` that should have been kept. 4. **SEA Error (Strategic Analyst Error):** The system's 'Strategic Intelligence Analyst'module failed in its reasoning. This can manifest in several ways: - **A) Flawed Deconstruction:** The'Required Findings' checklist in its analysis was incorrect or missed the main point of the user's question. - **B) Faulty Analysis:** The module failed to make a correct logical inference from the evidence, hallucinated a'Confirmed Finding'that wasn't supported, or incorrectly identified the 'Remaining Gaps'. - **C) Contradictory Verdict:** The detailed analysis pointed to missing information, but the final verdict was mistakenly 'Sufficient: Yes', causing the system to stop searching prematurely. 5. **Query Refinement Error:** After correctly identifying that the initial evidence was insufficient, the system failed to generate effective new sub-queries to target the specific information gaps. The new queries were redundant, vague, or did not address the missing pieces identified by the SEA module. 6. **Generation Failure:** All preceding steps worked correctly. The final set of evidence (`[Final Relevant Evidence]`) contained all the necessary information to form a correct answer. However, the language model failed during the final synthesis step by hallucinating, making incorrect logical inferences, or misinterpreting the provided evidence. **PRIMARY FAILURE RULE:** Identify the **earliest, most fundamental error** in the pipeline. For example, if Retrieval failed to find good documents, the Generation will also fail, but the root cause is **Retrieval Failure**. **EXECUTION TRACE FOR ANALYSIS:** [User Question]: "{question}" [Ground Truth Answer (The correct answer)]: "{ground_truth_answer}" [Generated (Incorrect) Answer]: "{final_answer}" --- RAG Pipeline Details --- [Initial Sub-Queries Generated]: {sub_queries} [All Retrieved Documents (Unfiltered)]: {all_retrieved_docs} [Discarded Documents (By Filter)]: {discarded_docs} [Final Relevant Evidence (Used for Generation)]: {final_evidence} --- Iteration Reports --- {iteration_reports_formatted} --- YOUR TASK --- Based on all the
