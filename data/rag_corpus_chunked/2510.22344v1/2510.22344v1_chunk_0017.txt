buried.”These new queries, now contextualized and specific, re-enter the hybrid retrieval cycle (Step 3.3.2). 3.4 Faithful Answer Generation Once the Structured Evidence Assessment (SEA) returns “Yes,” the curated and validated evidence set is passed to the generator LLM selected in the initial routing stage (Step 3.2). The generation process is governed by a meticulously engineered prompt that enforces astrict, evidence-only gen- eration protocol. This constrained prompt is de- signed to maximize faithfulness and minimize the risk of hallucination by instructing the LLM to: • Base its answerexclusivelyon the provided evidence. • Avoid introducing any external information, parametric knowledge, or opinions. • Cite every claim by embedding reference to- kens (e.g., [1], [2]) that link to the source doc- uments. • If the evidence is ultimately insufficient, state this directly without attempting to speculate. This highly constrained generation process is fundamental to mitigating hallucination and en- sures that the final output is not only accurate but also transparent and fully traceable to its sources. 3.5 Dynamic Resource Allocation and Prompt Engineering A key aspect of FAIR-RAG’s design is the efficient use of computational resources. We dynamically allocate LLMs of different sizes (e.g., SMALL, LARGE) for the various internal tasks based on their complexity. For instance, simpler tasks like theInitial Query Analysis and Adaptive Routing are handled by a smaller model, while the highly nuanced task ofquery refinementis assigned to a more capable model to ensure maximum precision. This dynamic allocation optimizes the trade-off between performance, cost, and latency. Furthermore, all interactions with LLM agents are managed through astructured prompt engi- neering methodologydesigned to ensure reliabil- ity and predictability [see Appendix B for details]. Our prompts are consistently engineered to include several key components that guide the model’s be- havior: • Role and Context Definition:Each prompt begins by establishing a clear role
