to generate queries that, when searched, will collectively cover all aspects of the original question. **Scaffolding:** First, understand the principles of effective decomposition: 1. **Identify Distinct Concepts:** Separate the main subjects, actions, conditions, and comparisons in the query. 2. **Use Synonyms & Related Terms:** Think about different ways a concept might be phrased in the database (e.g., "interaction" can be searched as "relationship" or "cooperation"). 3. **Create Meaningful Phrases:** Instead of single keywords, generate short phrases that preserve the context of the sub-question. 4. **Cover All Angles:** Ensure every part of the original question is represented by at least one sub-query. Now, study the following example carefully to understand how to apply these principles. --- EXAMPLE --- **Original User Query:** "What was Albert Einstein's view on quantum mechanics and how did he interact with Niels Bohr about it?" **Rationale/Analysis (This is your thought process):** The query has two main, distinct parts: 1. Einstein's **opinion/view** about quantum mechanics. 2. Einstein's **interaction** with Niels Bohr on the topic. A good search needs to find evidence for both aspects separately. Simply searching for "Einstein quantum mechanics" might not retrieve documents that specifically discuss his "view" or "interaction". Therefore, I should create targeted queries for each concept. **Optimized Queries (Output):** - Einstein's opinion on quantum mechanics - Einstein Bohr debates on quantum theory - Collaboration between Einstein and Bohr - Einstein's criticism of quantum mechanics --- END OF EXAMPLE --- Now, apply this exact methodology to decompose the following query. **User Query:** "{user_query}" **Constraints:** - The output must be a list of meaningful search phrases. - Each phrase must be on a new line, prefixed with a hyphen (-). - Queries must be in English. - Generate an optimized list of 1 to 4 sub-queries. Create ONLY as many as are **truly necessary** to
