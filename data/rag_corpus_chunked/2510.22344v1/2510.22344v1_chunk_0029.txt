The evaluation covers three complex multi-hop datasets (HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, Musique) and one open-domain factual dataset (TriviaQA). We report four metrics: Exact Match (EM), F1-Score, script-based Accuracy (ACC), and LLM-as-Judge Accuracy (ACCLLM). Our FAIR-RAG variants consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance, with the most significant improvements on the multi-hop tasks. The best-performing method for each metric is highlighted inbold. Underlined values denote results surpassing the Self-RAG and Iter-Retgen baselines. All scores are based on 1000 test/dev samples. dicated by the patterned bars) consistently achieve the highest F1 scores, particularly on the com- plex reasoning datasets of HotpotQA, 2WikiMulti- HopQA, and Musique. A key trend highlighted by the plots is thestrong positive correlation between the F1 score and the ACCLLM. This suggests that the architectural improvements within FAIR-RAG, which enhance the accuracy of the Large Language Model’s inter- nal processing and decision-making, are directly responsible for the enhanced final answer accu- racy. This relationship is particularly evident in the HotpotQA and 2WikiMultiHopQA
