to the final genera- tor, preventing the model from being distracted by Figure 1: Schematic overview of the FAIR-RAG architecture. The process starts with initial query analysis and adaptive language model selection (e.g., small, large, or reasoning LLM). For complex queries, it proceeds to query decomposition, followed by an iterative refinement cycle involving hybrid retrieval and reranking, evidence filtering, and Structured Evidence Assessment (SEA). The loop iterates until evidence sufficiency is confirmed, culminating in faithful answer generation grounded in the aggregated evidence. noisy or unhelpful information. 3.3.4 Structured Evidence Assessment (SEA): The Strategic Intelligence Analyst The strategic core of our iterative refinement loop is the Structured Evidence Assessment (SEA) mod- ule. Its primary function is not merely to verify evidence, but to perform a granulargap analysis that generates an explicit, actionable signal for the next iteration. For this critical task, we deliber- ately chose achecklist-based methodologyover alternatives like abstractive summarization or di- rect question-answering. Abstractive summariza- tion, by design, often conceals the very gaps we need to identify by creating a fluent narrative, while direct QA yields binary outcomes that fail to pin- point the precise location of missing information in a multi-fact query. Our approach operationalizes this checklist via an LLM agent prompted to act as aStrategic In- telligence Analyst. Through carefully engineered prompts—defining its role and providing few-shot examples (see Appendix B)—the agent firstde- constructsthe user’s query into a checklist of dis- crete, required informational components or “find- ings.” It then systematicallyauditsthe collected evidence against this checklist, confirming which findings are supported and identifying which re- main as explicit“intelligence gaps.”The evidence is deemed sufficient only if all required findings are confirmed. The ‘unchecked’ items on this list constitute adi- rect, interpretable, and actionable signalfor the subsequent Query Refinement module. This struc- tured, question-centric process provides a more controllable,
