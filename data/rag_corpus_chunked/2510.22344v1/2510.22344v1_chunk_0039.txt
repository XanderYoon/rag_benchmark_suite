British Museum, designed by ar- chitect Sir Robert Smirke, is a mas- terpiece of theGreek Revivalstyle, featuring a grand quadrangle and a portico of 44 columns.” – Structured Evidence Assessment (SEA): * is_sufficient: ‘Yes’ * analysis_summary:The refined queries successfully retrieved the fi- nal missing data points. All items on the ‘Required Findings’ checklist— the identities of both museums and their respective architectural styles— are now confirmed by the aggregated evidence. No information gaps re- main, enabling a direct, evidence- grounded comparison. •Final Faithful Generation:The system syn- thesizes the evidence fromboth parallel tracksinto a single, structured, and fully- grounded comparative answer: “The architectural styles of the buildings hous- ing the Mona Lisa and the Rosetta Stone are distinct. The Mona Lisa is housed in the Louvre Museumin Paris [1], which features a complex blend of historical styles includ- ingFrench Renaissance and Neoclassicism, along with a famousModernistpyramid [3]. The Rosetta Stone is located in theBritish Museumin London [2], which is a prime example of theGreek Revivalarchitectural style [4].” This case study highlights FAIR-RAG’s key architectural advantage: its ability to systemati- callydecomposea complex goal into parallel sub- problems and then applyiterative refinementto solve each one before synthesizing a comprehen- sive final answer. This structured, multi-threaded reasoning process is what enables it to succeed where other iterative or adaptive frameworks may fail. 5.2.4 Failure Mode Analysis To foster transparency and identify avenues for future improvement, we conducted a systematic failure mode analysis on a sample of 200 unique error instances drawn equally from our four bench- mark datasets: TriviaQA, MuSiQue, HotpotQA, and 2WikiMultihopQA. This analysis employed a hybrid methodology, combining LLM-based cat- egorization with human expert validation to en- sure accuracy and depth. Our taxonomy distin- guishes between two fundamental sources of error: (1)Component-Level Failures, which stem from the inherent limitations of the underlying
