We conduct exten- sive experiments on challenging multi-hop QA benchmarks, including HotpotQA, 2WikiMul- tiHopQA, and MusiQue.Under a unified and controlled experimental setup,FAIR-RAG significantly outperforms strong representative baselines. On HotpotQA, it achieves an F1- score of 0.453—an absolute improvement of 8.3 points over the strongest iterative baseline— establishing a new state-of-the-art for this class of methods on these benchmarks.Our work demonstrates that a structured, evidence- driven refinement process with explicit gap analysis is crucial for unlocking reliable and accurate reasoning in advanced RAG systems for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. 1 Introduction Large Language Models (LLMs) have demon- strated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of natural language processing tasks, including question-answering (QA) (Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022). However, their knowl- edge is inherently static, confined to the data they were trained on, which leads to factual inaccura- cies and an inability to reason about events beyond their training cut-off date. Furthermore, LLMs are prone to “hallucination,” generating plausible yet factually incorrect information, which severely limits their reliability in knowledge-intensive ap- plications (Ji et al., 2023). To mitigate these is- sues, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a prominent paradigm. By ground- ing the generation process on information retrieved from external knowledge bases, RAG systems aim to produce more accurate, timely, and verifiable responses (Lewis et al., 2020). Despite its advantages, the standard “retrieve- then-read” RAG pipeline often falls short when faced with real-world user queries, which are fre- quently complex and cannot be answered through a single-shot retrieval step. For instance, a query such as“Which movie, directed by the same per- son who directed Inception, won an Oscar for arXiv:2510.22344v1 [cs.CL] 25 Oct 2025 Best Cinematography?”requires multi-hop rea- soning (Yang et al., 2018): first identifying the director ofInception(Christopher Nolan) and then searching for his movies that have won the
