ings.” It then systematicallyauditsthe collected evidence against this checklist, confirming which findings are supported and identifying which re- main as explicit“intelligence gaps.”The evidence is deemed sufficient only if all required findings are confirmed. The ‘unchecked’ items on this list constitute adi- rect, interpretable, and actionable signalfor the subsequent Query Refinement module. This struc- tured, question-centric process provides a more controllable, reliable, and transparent mecha- nismfor gap analysis than less constrained meth- ods, ensuring a rigorous evaluation that prevents the system from being misled by large volumes of tangentially related information. 3.3.5 Iterative Query Refinement If the Structured Evidence Assessment (SEA) re- sults that the evidence is insufficient to correctly an- swer the question, the system activates the query re- finement module, which is designed to be a highly targeted intervention. An LLM agent uses the “Re- maining Gaps” and “Confirmed Findings” from the analyst’s summary (generated in the previous step) as its primary input. Its goal is to generate new, laser-focused queries that are engineered to findonlythe missing pieces of information. By leveraging the confirmed findings, the agent makes the new queries more precise and avoids repeating previous searches. For instance, if a query is“In what city was the lead scientist who broke the Enigma code buried?”and the analyst’s summary confirms“Alan Turing was the lead scientist”but identifies“Alan Turing’s burial place”as a gap, the refinement module will generate new, highly targeted queries like“Alan Turing burial place” or“city where Alan Turing is buried.”These new queries, now contextualized and specific, re-enter the hybrid retrieval cycle (Step 3.3.2). 3.4 Faithful Answer Generation Once the Structured Evidence Assessment (SEA) returns “Yes,” the curated and validated evidence set is passed to the generator LLM selected in the initial routing stage (Step 3.2). The generation process is governed by a meticulously engineered prompt that enforces astrict, evidence-only
