Errors): The Foundational BottleneckThese errors are not caused by FAIR-RAG’s reasoning process but by the fundamental limitations of the tools it or- chestrates. • Retrieval Failure (32.5%):This was the sin- gle largest source of error across all datasets. The retriever’s inability to surface critical doc- uments is a major obstacle, particularly for queries requiring highly specific, long-tail fac- tual knowledge. The primary root cause was identified as Knowledge Base Gaps, where the required information was simply absent from the corpus. This was especially pronounced in TriviaQA, where nearly half of all failures were retrieval-related due to the dataset’s re- liance on obscure facts. • Generation Failure (31.0%):In these cases, the correct evidence was successfully identi- fied and passed to the final generator, which still produced a flawed answer. This category represents a significant challenge across all datasets, highlighting the inherent faithfulness problem in modern LLMs. Common failure subtypes included: (i) Incorrect Entity Se- lection, where the model chose the wrong entity from a list of candidates in the evi- dence; (ii) Flawed Logical Inference, espe- cially in comparative questions (e.g., “who is younger?”); and (iii) Misinterpretation of Question Granularity, such as providing a spe- cific year (“1922”) when a decade (“1920s”) was requested. 2. Architectural Failures (36.5% of Errors): Re- fining the FAIR-RAG LogicThese errors are di- rectly attributable to FAIR-RAG’s internal decision- making modules and represent the most direct op- portunities for improving our framework. • SEA Error (24.5%):As the “brain” of the iterative process, failures in the Strategic Evi- dence Assessment module are particularly im- pactful. These errors were significantly more prevalent in complex, multi-hop datasets like MuSiQue, HotpotQA, and 2WikiMultihopQA. The most common subtypes were: (i) Faulty Analysis of Evidence, where the SEA module failed to make a correct logical inference from the provided documents (e.g., misinterpreting
