ReAct (Yao et al., 2022) and IRCoT (Trivedi et al., 2023), which guide an LLM to generate explicit reasoning traces (e.g., Chain-of-Thought (Wei et al., 2022)), where each step can trigger a retrieval action to gather neces- sary information. The key distinction lies in the scope and triggerfor retrieval. In methods like ReAct and IRCoT, retrieval is typically alocal, step-wise actiontriggered by the immediate need of the next thought in a chain. In contrast, FAIR- RAG’s retrieval is driven by aholistic assessment of the entire evidence pool against the overarch- ing query requirements, allowing it to identify and address complex, non-sequential information gaps that step-wise reasoning might overlook. More directly related to our work, frameworks like ITER-RETGEN (Shao et al., 2023) propose a synergistic loop where the entire generated output from one iteration serves as the context to retrieve more relevant knowledge for the next. While pow- erful, using unstructured generation as a query can be suboptimal, as it may contain noise that misdi- rects the retriever. FAIR-RAG distinguishes itself by employing a more controlled mechanism: in- stead of using the entire previous output, it gener- ates new, targeted sub-queries based on an explicit analysis ofinformational gaps, leading to a more focused and efficient evidence-gathering process. Other iterative frameworks have introduced forward-looking or corrective mechanisms to enhance retrieval precision. For instance, FLARE (Jiang et al., 2023) employs a proactive strategy where the LLM anticipates future informa- tion needs during generation and triggers retrievals accordingly, effectively interleaving prediction and lookup steps. Similarly, Corrective RAG (Yan et al., 2024) incorporates a post-retrieval correc- tion phase, using an evaluator to assess and refine retrieved documents based on their relevance and factual consistency. While these methods improve upon standard iterative loops by adding predictive or corrective elements, they often rely on heuristic triggers or
