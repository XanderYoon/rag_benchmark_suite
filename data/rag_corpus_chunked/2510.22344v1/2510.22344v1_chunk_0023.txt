these pairs for semantic correctness. The human judgments showed astrong degree of concordancewith the LLM-as-Judge’s binary “Yes/No” outputs, aligning in90%of the cases. This level of agreement is well within the range of typical human inter-annotator agreement for such a nuanced task. Therefore, we conclude that the LLM-as-Judge serves as a reliable and scalable proxy for human evaluation in our experiments. • Verification of Component-Level Quality Scores:For the more nuanced 1-to-5 scale scoring performed by the powerful Llama-4- Maverick model in our ablation study, a simi- lar validation was conducted. A separate ran- dom subset of 100 generated outputs from the component-level tasks (e.g., query refine- ment) was evaluated by a human expert, again blinded to the LLM’s score. The evaluation demonstrated a95%agreement between hu- man and LLM judgments across these differ- ent tasks. This confirms the judge’s capability for providing consistent, human-aligned qual- ity assessments. This dual validation confirms that our LLM-as- Judge methodologies, for both binary correctness and fine-grained quality scoring, serve as robust and reliable proxies for human evaluation, enabling a credible and scalable assessment of our frame- work’s performance. 4.4 Implementation Details To ensure a controlled and fair comparison, all ex- periments adhere to the global settings defined by the FlashRAG framework, with specific adapta- tions for our models. Methodological Alignment for Fair Compari- son:A cornerstone of our evaluation is the prin- ciple of fair comparison, ensuring that reported performance gains are attributable to our core ar- chitectural innovations (i.e., the iterative refinement cycle) rather than peripheral components. Our full proposed architecture includes features designed for optimal real-world efficiency, such as a hybrid retriever (Section 3.3.2) and an “OBVIOUS” query shortcut (Section 3.2). However, as these features are not standard in the baseline methods we com- pare against, they could introduce an unfair advan- tage. Therefore, to
