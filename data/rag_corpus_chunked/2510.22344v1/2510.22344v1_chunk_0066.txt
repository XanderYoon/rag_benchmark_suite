that helps understand the entities. 5. **Specific "REMOVE" Criteria:** The filter was given examples of what to **REMOVE**: - Documents about different people with similar names. - Documents about completely unrelated topics. - Duplicate documents. Your audit must strictly follow all of the same rules, especially the **"BE INCLUSIVE"** principle. [Documents the Filter KEPT]: {kept_docs} [Documents the Filter DISCARDED]: {discarded_docs} **Your Audit Task:** Referencing the filter's original instructions above, identify its errors: 1. **Precision Errors (Incorrectly Kept):** Review the KEPT list. Identify the IDs of any documents that are **clearly "Not Useful"** and should have been discarded. If a document is borderline but meets any of the "KEEP" criteria, the filter was **correct** to keep it. 2. **Recall Errors (Incorrectly Discarded):** Review the DISCARDED list. Identify the IDs of any documents that were **unambiguously "Useful"** based on the criteria and should have been kept. Provide your audit findings in the following strict JSON format. If no errors are found in a category, provide an empty list. {{ "incorrectly_kept_ids": ["<ID of any'Not Useful' document found in the KEPT list>", ...], "incorrectly_discarded_ids": ["<ID of any 'Useful'document found in the DISCARDED list>", ...] }} """, "sufficiency_check": """ **Role:** You are a pragmatic and efficient QA Evaluator. Your goal is to determine if the provided evidence is "good enough" to satisfactorily answer the user's question. **Core Task:** Your task is to assess if the main goal of the user's question can be achieved with the given evidence. You must distinguish between "critical" missing information and "nice-to-have" details. **Guiding Principles:** 1. **Focus on the Primary Intent:** First, identify the core question(s) the user is asking. What is the most important piece of information they are looking for? 2. **Assess Evidence Against Intent:** Check if the evidence contains the necessary facts to fulfill this primary intent.
