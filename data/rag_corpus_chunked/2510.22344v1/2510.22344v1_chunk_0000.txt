Current advanced RAG methods, employing iterative or adaptive strategies, still lack a robust mechanism to sys- tematically identify and fill evidence gaps, of- ten propagating noise or failing to gather a com- prehensive context. In this paper, we introduce FAIR-RAG, a novel agentic framework that transforms the standard RAG pipeline into a dynamic, evidence-driven reasoning process. At the core of FAIR-RAG is an Iterative Refine- ment Cycle governed by a novel module we term Structured Evidence Assessment (SEA). The SEA acts as an analytical gating mecha- nism: it deconstructs the initial query into a checklist of required findings and systemati- cally audits the aggregated evidence to iden- tify confirmed facts and, critically, explicit in- formational gaps. These identified gaps pro- vide a precise, actionable signal to an Adap- tive Query Refinement agent, which then gen- erates new, targeted sub-queries to retrieve the missing information. This cycle repeats until the evidence is verified as sufficient, ensuring a comprehensive context for a final, strictly faithful generation step. We conduct exten- sive experiments on challenging multi-hop QA benchmarks, including HotpotQA, 2WikiMul- tiHopQA, and MusiQue.Under a unified and controlled experimental setup,FAIR-RAG significantly outperforms strong representative baselines. On HotpotQA, it achieves an F1- score of 0.453—an absolute improvement of 8.3 points over the strongest iterative baseline— establishing a new state-of-the-art for this class of methods on these benchmarks.Our work demonstrates
