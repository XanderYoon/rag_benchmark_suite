This table isolates and evaluates the effectiveness of four key components: Query Decomposition, Evidence Filtering, Structured Evidence Assessment (SEA), and Query Refinement. The Avg. Score is based on a 1-to-5 Likert scale, while F1-Score and Accuracy are expressed as percentages. All scores averaged over 1000 samples. validates that the LLM agents are proficient at both breaking down complex queries and intelligently generating new queries to fill in- formation gaps identified by the SEA module. • Evidence Filtering Presents a Precision- Recall Trade-off:The filtering module’s per- formance varies, with F1 scores ranging from 55.47%on 2WikiMultiHopQA to76.05%on TriviaQA. While the filter is effective at reduc- ing context noise (precision), its aggressive na- ture can sometimes prune useful information (recall). This highlights a classic trade-off and presents a clear avenue for future optimiza- tion. • Structured Evidence Assessment (SEA) is a Challenging but Crucial Task:The SEA module, which governs the iterative loop, demonstrates strong performance on complex multi-hop datasets, achieving an accuracy of 81.73%on 2WikiMultiHopQA and83.19% on Musique. Its lower accuracy on TriviaQA (54.38%) is expected, as the sufficiency deci- sion for single-hop factual questions can be more ambiguous. These results confirm the module’s value as the central control mecha- nism for the iterative process, proving highly reliable when it matters most. It is important to note that a direct ablation study removing the
