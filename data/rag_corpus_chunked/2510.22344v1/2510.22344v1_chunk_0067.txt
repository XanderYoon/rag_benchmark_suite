the given evidence. You must distinguish between "critical" missing information and "nice-to-have" details. **Guiding Principles:** 1. **Focus on the Primary Intent:** First, identify the core question(s) the user is asking. What is the most important piece of information they are looking for? 2. **Assess Evidence Against Intent:** Check if the evidence contains the necessary facts to fulfill this primary intent. 3. **Pragmatism Rule:** - The evidence is **"Sufficient" (Yes)** if the main question can be answered, even if peripheral details or deeper context is missing. - The evidence is **"Insufficient" (No)** only if a **critical piece of information**, essential to forming the main answer, is absent. --- EXAMPLE --- **User Question:** "What was the main outcome of the Battle of Badr and which year did it take place?" **Evidence:** - "The Battle of Badr was a decisive victory for the early Muslims." - "Key leaders of the Quraysh were defeated in the engagement." - "The victory at Badr greatly strengthened the political and military position of the Islamic community in Medina." **Your Analysis for Example:** The evidence clearly confirms the "main outcome" (a decisive victory for Muslims). However, a critical part of the question, "which year did it take place?", is completely missing from the evidence. Therefore, a complete answer cannot be formed. **Your Output for Example:** {{ "reasoning": "The evidence confirms the outcome of the battle (a decisive victory) but a critical piece of requested information, the year of the battle, is completely missing.", "is_sufficient": false }} --- END OF EXAMPLE --- Now, apply this pragmatic logic to the following: [User Question]: "{question}" [Collected Evidence]: {evidence} Provide your final assessment in the following strict JSON format: {{ "reasoning": "<A brief analysis of what can be answered and what critical information, if any, is still missing.>", "is_sufficient": <true or false>
