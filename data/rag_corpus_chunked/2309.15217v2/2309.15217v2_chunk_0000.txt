RAG systems are composed of a retrieval and an LLM based generation module, and provide LLMs with knowledge from a reference textual database, which enables them to act as a natu- ral language layer between a user and textual databases, reducing the risk of hallucinations. Evaluating RAG architectures is, however, chal- lenging because there are several dimensions to consider: the ability of the retrieval system to identify relevant and focused context passages, the ability of the LLM to exploit such passages in a faithful way, or the quality of the genera- tion itself. With Ragas, we put forward a suite of metrics which can be used to evaluate these different dimensions without having to rely on ground truth human annotations. We posit that such a framework can crucially contribute to faster evaluation cycles of RAG architectures, which is especially important given the fast adoption of LLMs. 1 Introduction Language Models (LMs) capture a vast amount of knowledge about the world, which allows them to answer questions without accessing any exter- nal sources. This idea of LMs as repositories of knowledge emerged shortly after the introduction of BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and became more firmly established with the introduction of ever larger LMs (Roberts et al., 2020). While the most recent Large Language Models (LLMs) capture enough knowledge to rival human performance across a wide variety of question answering bench- marks (Bubeck et al., 2023), the idea of using LLMs as knowledge bases still has two fundamen- tal limitations. First,
