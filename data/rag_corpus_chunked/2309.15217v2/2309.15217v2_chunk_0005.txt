focused on using an LLM to select the best answer among a number of candidates (Wang et al., 2023b), typically to compare the performance of different LLMs. However, care is needed with this approach, as the order in which the answers is presented can influence the result (Wang et al., 2023b). In terms of how ground truth answers or, more generally, generations, have been typically used in the literature, most approaches have relied on the availability of one or more reference answers. For instance, BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020) and MoverScore (Zhao et al., 2019) use contex- tualised embeddings, produced by a pre-trained BERT model, to compare the similarity between the generated answer and the reference answers. BARTScore (Yuan et al., 2021) similarly uses refer- ence answers to compute aspects such as precision (estimated as the probability of generating the gen- erated answer given the reference) and recall (esti- mated as the probability of generating the reference given the generated answer). 3 Evaluation Strategies We consider a standard RAG setting, where given a question q, the system first retrieves some context c(q) and then uses the retrieved context to generate an answer as(q). When building a RAG system, we usually do not have access to human-annotated datasets or reference answers. We therefore fo- cus on metrics that are fully self-contained and reference-free. We focus in particular three quality aspects, which we argue are of central importance. First, Faithfulness refers to the idea that the an- swer should be grounded in the given context. This is important to avoid hallucinations, and to ensure that the retrieved context can act as a justification for the generated answer. Indeed, RAG systems are often used in applications where the factual con- sistency of the generated text w.r.t. the grounded sources is highly important, e.g.
