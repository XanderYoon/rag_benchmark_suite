2019) and became more firmly established with the introduction of ever larger LMs (Roberts et al., 2020). While the most recent Large Language Models (LLMs) capture enough knowledge to rival human performance across a wide variety of question answering bench- marks (Bubeck et al., 2023), the idea of using LLMs as knowledge bases still has two fundamen- tal limitations. First, LLMs are not able to answer questions about events that have happened after they were trained. Second, even the largest models struggle to memorise knowledge that is only rarely mentioned in the training corpus (Kandpal et al., 2022; Mallen et al., 2023). The standard solution to these issues is to rely on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) (Lee et al., 2019; Lewis et al., 2020; Guu et al., 2020). Answering a question then essentially involves retrieving relevant pas- sages from a corpus and feeding these passages, along with the original question, to the LM. While initial approaches relied on specialised LMs for retrieval-augmented language modelling (Khandel- wal et al., 2020; Borgeaud et al., 2022), recent work has suggested that simply adding retrieved docu- ments to the input of a standard LM can also work well (Khattab et al., 2022; Ram et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2023), thus making it possible to use retrieval- augmented strategies in combination with LLMs that are only available through APIs. While the usefulness of retrieval-augmented strategies is clear, their implementation requires a significant amount of tuning, as the overall per- formance will be affected by the retrieval model, the considered corpus, the LM, or the prompt for- mulation, among others. Automated evaluation of retrieval-augmented systems is thus paramount. In practice, RAG systems are often evaluated in terms of the language modelling task itself, i.e. by mea- suring perplexity on some reference corpus. How- ever, such
