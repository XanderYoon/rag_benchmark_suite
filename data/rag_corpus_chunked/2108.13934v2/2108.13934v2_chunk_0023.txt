KGI1 achieves substantially better perfor- mance than the aforementioned zero-shot base- lines on all evaluation metrics. However, HIT@1 is∼ 28% which is signiﬁcantly lower compared with the numbers reported on the datasets in KILT. This begs the question, how to further improve the transfer learning capabilities of these genera- tive models? Interestingly, HIT@5/10 are high (i.e. ∼ 64%/76%). This indicates our approach would be useful in a human-in-the-loop scenario by pro- viding valuable candidates for the ﬁllers that can be further validated. For this purpose, we also conduct few-shot ex- periments to understand the robustness of KGI1 by ﬁne-tuning it with very limited amounts of train- ing examples. We randomly pick n example(s) for each relation type from the TACRED training set, with n = [1, 4]. Table 9 gives our hyperparameters for the TACRED few-shot
