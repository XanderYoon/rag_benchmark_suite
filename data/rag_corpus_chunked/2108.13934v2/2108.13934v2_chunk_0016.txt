effec- tive at generating slot ﬁllers from relevant explicit knowledge because it was trained on more cases of justifying explicit knowledge. However, given random passages it is the worst. It has sacriﬁced some implicit knowledge for better capabilities in using explicit knowledge. As shown in Table 5, BART LARGE, which is the best implicit-knowledge baseline system for KILT slot ﬁlling, is approximately 40 points lower in in accuracy on T-REx if compared toKGI1. To understand the impact of the explicit knowledge provided by DPR, we examine the improvement of KGI over BARTLARGE. We consider two main hypotheses: 1) the value of explicit knowledge depends on the relation, and 2) the value of explicit knowledge depends on the corpus frequency of the entities related. To evaluate hypothesis 1, we consider the most frequent 20 relations in the T-REx Dev set, each occurring at least 40 times. The relations with the lowest relative performance gain are taxonomy and partonomy relations: TAXON -RANK , SUBCLASS - OF, INSTANCE -OF, PART-OF and PARENT -TAXON as well as LANGUAGES -SPOKEN ,- WRITTEN -OR- SIGNED and SPORT . This suggest that essential properties of entities are well encoded in the lan- guage model itself. Inspecting the LANGUAGES - SPOKEN ,- WRITTEN -OR-SIGNED we ﬁnd that sur- R-Prec Recall@5 Accuracy F1 KILT-AC KILT-F1 zsRE KGI1 98.49 99.23 72.55 77.05 72.31 76.69 KGI0 94.18 95.19 68.97 74.47 68.32 73.45 DensePhrases 57.43 60.47 47.42 54.75 41.34 46.79 GENRE 95.81 97.83 0.02 2.10 0.00 1.85 Multi-DPR 80.91 93.05 57.95 63.75 50.64 55.44 RAG (KILT organizers) 53.73 59.52 44.74 49.95 36.83 39.91 BARTLARGE N/A N/A 9.14 12.21 N/A N/A T-REx KGI1 74.36 83.14 84.36 87.24 69.14 70.58 KGI0 59.70 70.38 77.90 81.31 55.54 56.79 DensePhrases 37.62 40.07 53.90 61.74 27.84 32.34 GENRE 79.42 85.33 0.10 7.67 0.04 6.66 Multi-DPR 69.46 83.88
