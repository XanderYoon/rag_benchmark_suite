Wikipedia, and the relations in the KG are different from those in Wikidata. In order to perform an in-depth com- parison and analysis, we also propose a new set of ranking baselines and use metrics which are suitable to better evaluate the slot ﬁlling task in a zero-shot setup. 5.1 Zero-shot TACRED The TACRED dataset was originally proposed by Zhang et al. (2017) with the goal to provide a high-quality training set to supervise a relation extraction model which is shown to be competitive on TAC-KBP 2015 (Ellis et al., 2015). The target KG schema consists of two infoboxes modeling the person and organization entity types, with 41 rela- tion types in total. For our experiments, we adopt a revisited version of TACRED (Alt et al., 2020), in which a second stage crowdsourcing is performed to further improve the quality of the annotations and resolve conﬂicts among relations. In a typical supervised relation extraction setup, a model is trained to predict (i.e. classify) the right relation type given a textual passage and two en- tity mentions as inputs. In this paper we used the TACRED dataset as a slot ﬁlling benchmark, us- ing the following procedure: 1) we ﬁrst create the corpus by merging all the plain textual passages from the instances in the train, dev and test sets; 2) we collect the annotated triples, i.e. subject- relation-object, from the test data to come up with a ground-truth KG to be used for slot ﬁlling evalua- tion5; 3) we remove all the triples from the original test set where the subjects are pronouns. The result- ing KG consists of 2673 slot ﬁllingtest instances. Similarly, we acquire a KG from the train/dev sets to further ﬁne-tune theKGI system as described in the next section. To enable zero-shot experiments, we also convert
