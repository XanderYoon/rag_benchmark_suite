In contrast, the relations that gain the most from explicit knowledge are: PERFORMER , MEMBER - OF-SPORTS -TEAM , AUTHOR , PLACE -OF-BIRTH , COUNTRY -OF-ORIGIN , CAST-MEMBER , DIREC - TOR. These relations are not central to the meaning of the head entity, like the taxonomy and parton- omy relations, and are not typically predictable from surface-level features. Regarding our second hypothesis, we might ex- pect that more frequent entities have better repre- sentations in the parameters of a pre-trained lan- guage model, and that therefore the gain in perfor- mance due to use of explicit knowledge will show a strong dependence on the corpus frequency of the head or tail entity. To test it, we group the Dev instances in T-Rex according to the decile of the head or tail entity frequency. We compute a macro-accuracy, weight- ing all relations equally. Figure 5 shows the macro- accuracy of BARTLARGE and KGI1 for each decile of head and tail entity frequency. Although there is
