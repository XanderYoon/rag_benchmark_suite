Robust Retrieval Augmented Generation for Zero-shot Slot Filling Michael Glass, Gaetano Rossiello, Md Faisal Mahbub Chowdhury, Alﬁo Gliozzo IBM Research AI Thomas J. Watson Research Center, NY Abstract Automatically inducing high quality knowl- edge graphs from a given collection of docu- ments still remains a challenging problem in AI. One way to make headway for this prob- lem is through advancements in a related task known as slot ﬁlling. In this task, given an entity query in form of [E NTITY , S LOT, ?], a system is asked to ‘ﬁll’ the slot by generat- ing or extracting the missing value exploiting evidence extracted from relevant passage(s) in the given document collection. The recent works in the ﬁeld try to solve this task in an end-to-end fashion using retrieval-based lan- guage models. In this paper, we present a novel approach to zero-shot slot ﬁlling that ex- tends dense passage retrieval with hard neg- atives and robust training procedures for re- trieval augmented generation models. Our model reports large improvements on both T- REx and zsRE slot ﬁlling datasets, improving both passage retrieval and slot value genera- tion, and ranking at the top-1 position in the KILT leaderboard. Moreover, we demonstrate the robustness of our system showing its do- main adaptation capability on a new variant of the TACRED dataset for slot ﬁlling, through a combination of zero/few-shot learning. We re- lease the source code and pre-trained models1. 1 Introduction Slot ﬁlling is a sub-task of Knowledge Base Pop- ulation (KBP), where the goal is to recognize a pre-determined set of relations for a given entity and use them to populate infobox like structures. This can be done by exploring the occurrences of the input entity in the corpus and gathering infor- mation about its slot ﬁllers from the context in
