the scoring function as cosine(e + s, vi), for each candidate ﬁller vi. It is based on the assumption that a relation s be- tween two (multi)word embeddings e and v can be represented as an offset vector (v− e) = s ⇐⇒ (e+s) = v (Rossiello et al., 2019; Vylomova et al., 2016). Finally, GPT-2 computes the perplexity of the fragment of text by concatenating the tokens in e, s and each vi (Radford et al., 2019). Metrics Due to the similarity of slot ﬁlling with the knowledge base completion task, we use Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and HIT@k, with k = [1, 5, 10], as evaluation metrics (Bordes et al., 2013). Note that HIT@1 has the same meaning of the accuracy for the downstream task on KILT.
