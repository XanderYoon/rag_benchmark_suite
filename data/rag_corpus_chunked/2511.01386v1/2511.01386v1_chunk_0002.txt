modular evaluation provides insights into individual technique effectiveness, it fundamentally ignores potential synergies and conflicts between components. A retrieval method that excels with one reranker may underperform with another; an augmentation strategy beneficial for one generation approach may hinder another. The assumption that locally optimal choices yield globally optimal configurations is untenable when components interact in complex, non-linear ways. This limitation is compounded by the domain-specificity of RAG optimization. Optimal con- figurations vary substantially across knowledge domains due to differences in content structure, terminology consistency, and question types. A RAG pipeline tuned for medical literature—with its standardized terminology and hierarchical organization—may perform poorly on legal documents with their variable section lengths and dense cross-references. Similarly, the effectiveness of specific techniques depends on dataset characteristics: query expansion may benefit domains with lexical variation, while multi-stage reranking proves essential for high-density knowledge bases. Existing optimization approaches, by treating domains uniformly and optimizing components independently, fail to capture these domain-specific patterns and inter-component dependencies. In this work, we present RAGSmith, a framework for holistic RAG pipeline optimization through evolutionary search. Our key insight is that RAG configuration should be treated as a complete- pipeline optimization problem rather than independent module selection. We introduce a modular pipeline architecture encompassing nine stages—from pre-embedding enrichment through post- generation refinement—and implement 46,080 possible configurations. Using genetic algorithms, we evolve complete pipeline configurations, evaluating fitness holistically and allowing modules that may be suboptimal in isolation to emerge when they enhance overall system performance. We apply RAGSmith to six domain-specific datasets derived from Wikipedia articles (Mathe- matics, Law, Finance, Medicine, Defense Industry, and Computer Science), each containing 100 questions across three categories:factual,interpretation, andlong-answer. Through comprehensive evaluation comparing optimized configurations against naive RAG baseline, we demonstrate con- sistent improvements averaging +3.8% overall performance (ranging from +1.2% to +6.9% across domains),
