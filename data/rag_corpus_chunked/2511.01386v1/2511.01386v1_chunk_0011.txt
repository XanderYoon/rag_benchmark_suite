first-order design problem. This motivates automated frameworks that can search, rank, or adapt retrieval and indexing strategies to the target domain instead of relying on a single hand-tuned recipe. 2.3 Query Reformulation and Pre-Retrieval Conditioning The effectiveness of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline depends not only on how we retrieve and index documents, but also onwhatquery is actually sent to the retriever. In practice, systems rarely submit the user’s raw question directly. Instead, they apply a set of pre-retrieval conditioning steps—query rewriting, expansion, instruction interpretation, and decomposition—to improve recall, robustness, and controllability. This section surveys these techniques and argues that “the query that hits the retriever” is itself a tunable design parameter that can vary by domain, task, and corpus. 2.3.1 Query Rewriting and Query Expansion A classic strategy in information retrieval isquery expansion: adding new terms to the query to increase the likelihood of matching relevant documents. This dates back to pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF), where the system first retrieves an initial set of candidate documents, assumes (some of) them are relevant, extracts salient terms, and then issues an expanded query [18, 19]. PRF and related relevance feedback methods improve recall by bridging vocabulary gaps between the original query and target passages. Neural variants of query expansion have adapted this idea to modern retrievers. One line of work uses generation models to synthesize likely answer-bearing text, then uses that synthetic text to guide retrieval. For example,doc2querytrains a sequence-to-sequence model to generate plausible queries for each document, effectively augmenting the document index with “imagined” questions and improving matching for sparse and dense retrievers alike [20]. More recent approaches invert that direction: instead of expanding documents, they expand thequery. Hypothetical Document 6 Embeddings (HyDE) prompt a large language model to generate a short “pseudo answer passage” for the user question; that passage
