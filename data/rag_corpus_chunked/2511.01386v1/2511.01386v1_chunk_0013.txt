did not explicitly mention, improving recall@k in downstream RAG. Overall, query rewriting / expansion increases the chance that at least one relevant chunk appears in the retrieved set, which directly benefits the generator in RAG by exposing it to more grounded evidence. 2.3.2 Instruction-to-Query Mapping and Search Intent Normalization In many practical deployments, users do not issue “search queries”; they issueinstructions. For instance: “Summarize safety violations in last week’s turbine log.” or “Give me the name who made this claim.” These instructions are often imperative, stylistic, or under-specified with respect to retrievable content. The retrieval system, however, expects something closer to a factual entity- and evidence-oriented query. Instruction-to-query mapping refers to transforming these high-level intents into retrieval-friendly search strings that capture the actual information need. In enterprise QA and domain-specific RAG, this often means: (1) extracting named entities, time ranges, product identifiers, regulation codes, etc.; (2) reframing subjective or task-oriented language into an objective evidence request (“list safety violations in turbine log from [DATE RANGE]”); (3) normalizing noisy or informal user language (e.g., slang, abbreviations, hashtags) into canonical terms that match how knowledge is stored in the corpus. Work on conversational search and multi-turn QA formalizes this as “query resolution”: converting a user’s contextual question into an explicit, well-formed retrieval query that captures entities, temporal scope, and disambiguated referents [22]. In open-domain QA, similar techniques have been applied to standardize natural-language questions into retrieval-oriented forms that better align with Wikipedia or web-style evidence [23]. For RAG over noisy domains such as social media, chats, or incident logs, this step is crucial. The underlying corpus may encode events in terse, domain-specific shorthand. A generic LLM-style user question (“what happened with engine 3 yesterday?”) is usually not lexically aligned with those internal notes (e.g., “ENG3 vib spike at 14:37; auto-shutdown interlock tripped”).
