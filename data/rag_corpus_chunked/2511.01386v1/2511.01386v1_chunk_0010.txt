can be fed directly to the generator without much irrelevant context. 5 •Larger chunks: higher recall, because a single retrieved unit is more likely to contain the answer somewhere inside it, but it may also contain distracting or noisy text. Overlap (sliding windows with stride< window size) is often used so that information spanning a boundary is not lost. Chunk granularity interacts with the retriever and the generator. Dense retrievers may benefit from semantically coherent chunks, since embeddings assume each chunk is internally consistent. FiD-style generators [9] can ingest many retrieved chunks independently, so they tolerate smaller, more numerous chunks as long as the index can return enough candidates. In contrast, RAG setups that concatenate top-k passages into a single context window may prefer slightly longer chunks to avoid blowing up the number of retrieved segments. 2.2.2 Implications for Automated Retrieval Configuration The design axes above—sparse vs. dense vs. hybrid retrieval, late-interaction vs. single-vector encodings, reranking strategies, ANN index choice, multi-vector vs. single-vector storage, and chunk sizing/overlap—jointly determine recall, precision, latency, memory footprint, and factual grounding quality in a downstream RAG system [8, 9, 17]. Critically, these axes arenotuniversally optimal: a configuration that works best for noisy, short, user-authored queries over a constantly changing knowledge base may be very different from the configuration that works best for long, technical queries over stable scientific PDFs. Because the retrieval stage gates what evidence the generator ever sees, choosing this configuration is a first-order design problem. This motivates automated frameworks that can search, rank, or adapt retrieval and indexing strategies to the target domain instead of relying on a single hand-tuned recipe. 2.3 Query Reformulation and Pre-Retrieval Conditioning The effectiveness of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline depends not only on how we retrieve and index documents, but also onwhatquery is actually sent to
