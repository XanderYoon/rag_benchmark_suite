the full computational cost of applying LLM reasoning to large candidate sets. Empirical studies show this combined strategy reduces ranking errors, especially in out-of-domain scenarios, and balances precision, flexibility, and efficiency in reranking systems. [98] 3.2.5 Passage Filter Passage filter is simply the policy on how to limit the number of chunks that will be sent to the generation component. 1. Simple Threshold (Top-K): Simple threshold simply filters the top-k relevant documents out of the retrieved documents according to their retrieval (similarity) score. 2. Similarity Threshold: Similarity threshold does not limit the number of retrieved documents, instead it filters the documents according to whether their similarity (retrieval) score exceed a set threshold. 3.2.6 Passage Augmentation Passage augmentation enhances retrieval performance by expanding the initial set of retrieved passages with additional, contextually related content. Using metadata such as relationships between neighboring passages, it identifies and incorporates supplementary text segments to provide a broader and more coherent context for generation.[97] 1. Prev-Next Augmenter: Prev-Next Passage Augmenter improves retrieval by including neigh- boring passages alongside the initially retrieved ones. During chunking, each passage is linked to its preceding and succeeding segments, allowing the system to retrieve contextual neighbors that may hold supplementary information. This method enhances coherence and recall by ensuring that relevant surrounding context is not overlooked during retrieval.[97] 21 2. Relevant Segment Extraction (RSE):Relevant Segment Extraction is a query-time technique that merges clusters of related text chunks into larger, semantically coherent segments. This method aims to provide language models with richer contextual input by identifying the portions of text most relevant to the query, rather than relying on fixed-length chunk boundaries. While straightforward factual queries may be resolved within a single chunk, complex questions often require synthesizing information spread across multiple sections. By dynamically constructing these extended segments, RSE ensures that
