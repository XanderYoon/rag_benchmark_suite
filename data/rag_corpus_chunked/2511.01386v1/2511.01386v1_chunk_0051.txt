modular GA design enabled rapid experimentation with different mutation, crossover, and selection operators, ultimately resulting in a robust and efficient optimization pipeline. 5 Results and Discussion 5.1 Main Performance Comparison Applying RAGSmith to the six distinct datasets, we obtained substantial improvements over the naive RAG baseline. As illustrated in Figure 3, the highest improvement in retrieval performance 26 (a) Retrieval performance comparison. (b) Generation performance comparison.

The overall highest combined score (mean of retrieval and generation metrics) was achieved in Computer Science (+6.9% overall), followed by Mathematics (+5.1%), as shown in Figure 4. Table 3 presents the overall performance comparison between our optimized RAG configurations and the naive RAG baseline across all datasets. 27 Table 4: Comparison of Best vs. Baseline results across domains for Retrieval metrics.
