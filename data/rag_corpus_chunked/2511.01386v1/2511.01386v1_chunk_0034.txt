design space to be searched per domain. 3 Method 3.1 Problem Statement and Scope We formalize the modular RAG design by selecting one technique (or not selecting any technique) from each of the nine RAG technique families to maximize an overall evaluation objective. Let the search space be a product of discrete sets with conditional dependencies across families. Figure 1: RAG Technique Categories Figure 2: All RAG Techniques used in RAGSmith 17 3.2 Modular RAG Design Space (Concrete Families) We factor the pipeline into nine technique families implemented in the repository: 3.2.1 Pre-Embedding Pre-Embedding is a process where the chunks of a document will be processed and transformed into a form that is better suited for RAG system, before embedding into a vector database or other retrieval methods. 1. Contextual Chunk Headers: AutoContext introduces the concept of Contextual Chunk Headers (CCH), a method that enhances the semantic quality of embeddings by attaching document-level and section-level context to each chunk before it is embedded. By prepending these contextual headers, the embeddings capture not only the local meaning of a passage but also its broader role within the document. This enriched representation leads to notable improvements in retrieval quality, increasing the likelihood of retrieving the correct information while reducing the presence of irrelevant results. As a result, CCH improves both the precision of retrieval and the reliability of downstream applications, mitigating instances where large language models might otherwise misinterpret or misapply isolated text fragments.[83] 2. Parent Document Retriever: The Parent Document Retriever addresses the trade-off between semantic precision and contextual coherence in document chunking. While smaller chunks yield highly specific embeddings, they often lose connection to the broader narrative of the source text. Conversely, larger chunks preserve context but dilute the semantic relevance of fine-grained details. This method resolves the tension by
