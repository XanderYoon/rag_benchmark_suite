or web-style evidence [23]. For RAG over noisy domains such as social media, chats, or incident logs, this step is crucial. The underlying corpus may encode events in terse, domain-specific shorthand. A generic LLM-style user question (“what happened with engine 3 yesterday?”) is usually not lexically aligned with those internal notes (e.g., “ENG3 vib spike at 14:37; auto-shutdown interlock tripped”). Systems that 7 explicitly map user questions to retrieval-style intent—by inserting canonical terms like “vibration spike,” timestamps, component names, and system IDs—can dramatically improve first-stage recall in both sparse and dense retrieval. This is, in practice, a tunable knob that must often be tailored per domain. 2.3.3 Decomposition and Multi-Hop Retrieval Many queries, especially in knowledge-intensive QA, are inherently multi-hop: answering them requires chaining together multiple pieces of evidence across different passages or entities [25]. A single monolithic query may under-specify these intermediate steps. For example: “Was the company founded by the same person who led the Mars mission contract?” implicitly asks: (i) who founded the company, (ii) who led the Mars mission contract, and (iii) are they the same person. Question decomposition addresses this by breaking complex questions into simpler sub-queries that can each be retrieved more easily [26, 27]. A common pattern is iterative retrieval: retrieve for sub-question 1, extract key entities from the result, then use those entities to form sub-question 2, and so on, accumulating evidence across hops [25, 26]. More recent agent-style methods push this further by letting an LLM reason step-by-step and issue retrieval calls at each step. In ReAct, the model interleaves chain-of-thought reasoning with tool calls (including retrieval), generating intermediate hypotheses and follow-up search queries [28]. This effectively learns todecomposeat inference time: the system does not just expand the original query, it plans a sequence of targeted retrieval queries that progressively narrow
