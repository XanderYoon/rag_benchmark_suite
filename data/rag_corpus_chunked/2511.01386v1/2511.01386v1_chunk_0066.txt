heavy datasets (Medicine: 53%, Finance: 51%, Law: 49%) which show more modest gains (+1.9% to +4.4%). This pattern suggests that current RAG optimization techniques excel at improving information retrieval and contextual organization but have limited impact on enhancing inferential reasoning capabilities—a finding that highlights important directions for future research. Second, we identify a "robust RAG backbone" consisting ofvector_retrieval retrieval and reflection_revising post-generation, which appear across all optimal configurations. This con- sistency across diverse domains indicates that these components provide fundamental capabilities that generalize effectively. Beyond this backbone, domain-specific modules emerge based on dataset characteristics: chunk density determines reranker selection (cross-encoder for sparse datasets, hybrid reranker for dense ones); information density uniformity guides augmentation strategy choice (fixed- window for uniform content, adaptive-window for variable density); and the presence of contextual dependencies motivates pre-embedding enrichment strategies. Third, the genetic search approach demonstrates remarkable efficiency, achieving high-quality configurations while evaluating less than 0.2% of the 46,080 possible architectures. The algorithm’s ability to systematically prune ineffective modules—such as passage compression (never selected) and overly restrictive query expansion methods—validates evolutionary optimization as a practical approach for navigating large RAG design spaces where exhaustive search or manual tuning is infeasible. Our analysis of individual datasets reveals nuanced patterns in how Wikipedia article structure influences optimal RAG configuration. Computer Science’s dramatic retrieval improvement (+12.5%) stems from the synergy between low chunk density (34.4 chunks/article) and multi-query expansion’s ability to cover the compact search space thoroughly. Mathematics’ unique adoption of contextual chunk headers directly addresses the hierarchical organization of mathematical encyclopedia entries, enabling +7.5% improvement in LLM-based generation scores by preserving relationships between definitions, properties, and applications. Conversely, Medicine’s modest improvement (+1.9%) reflects the domain’s already-strong baseline performance, attributable to standardized article structures and consistent medical terminology that make even simple retrieval effective.
