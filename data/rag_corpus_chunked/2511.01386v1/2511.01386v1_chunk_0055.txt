Filtering. Their optimal selections for each dataset are shown in 29 Table 6: Best-performingRetrieval-sidemodule combinations discovered by RAGSmith for each dataset. The retrieval pipeline includes Pre-Embedding, Query Expansion, Retrieval, Reranking, and Passage Filtering. "–" indicates the module was not applied in that configuration.

Across all domains, vector_retrieval emerged as the dominant retriever. This consistency reflects its balanced performance between semantic precision and contextual coherence, suggesting that its embedding granularity generalizes effectively across domains with varying lexical overlap and content densities. The prevalence ofmulti-query expansion in four out of six datasets (Finance, Law, Mathe- matics, Computer Science) confirms its role in enhancing recall through semantic diversification. Notably, Medicine and Defense Industry omit query expansion, which correlates with their high chunk densities (50.9 and 50.6 chunks/article respectively)—with more chunks already available, exhaustive query expansion may introduce diminishing returns or noise. Other query expansion modules such as decomposition and step-back prompting were consistently pruned during evolution, suggesting they suffer from overly restrictive assumptions about query structure that limit their generalizability. The pre-embedding stage, utilized only in Mathematics throughcontextual_chunk_headers, proved advantageous for this domain where Wikipedia articles are organized hierarchically. Mathe- matical encyclopedia entries typically structure content from general concepts to specific applications (e.g., a calculus article moving from definitions to theorems to examples), and enriching chunks with their section context helps maintain these conceptual relationships during retrieval. This aligns with Mathematics having the highest proportion oflong-answerquestions (41%), which benefit from understanding how different parts of an article relate to each other. Reranking proved essential across
