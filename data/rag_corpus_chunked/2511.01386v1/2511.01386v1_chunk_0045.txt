Self-RAG improves both the precision of retrieval and the trustworthiness of long-form generations across diverse tasks. [101] 3.3 Search Space Parameterization Families and options are drawn from concrete implementations registered in the repository. Each gene indexes a valid option per family; feasibility checks rule out incompatible combinations (e.g., reranking requiring retrieval outputs of sufficient size). Each gene encodes a categorical decision within the modular RAG pipeline. This representation allows the search to explore heterogeneous architectures spanning multiple retrieval paradigms. 3.4 Objective and Scalarization Candidates are scored by an overall functionF (x) ∈ [0, 1]combining retrieval metrics (Recall@k, mAP, nDCG@k, MRR) and generation metrics (LLM-based score, semantic similarity). We also report component metrics alongsideF(x). RetrievalScore(x) = 1 4 (Recall@k(x) +mAP(x) +nDCG@k(x) +MRR(x))(1) GenerationScore(x) = 1 2 (LLM-Judge(x) +Semantic(x))(2) F(x) = 1 2 (RetrievalScore(x) +GenerationScore(x))(3) Algorithm 1RAGSmith: Genetic Architecture Search for Modular RAG Require:category sizes(d 1, . . . , d9), populationP, generationsT, rates(p c, pm), elitism sizek 1:Initialize populationS 0 with random genesxi ∈ {0, . . . , di −1} 2:EvaluateS 0 via API with caching to obtainF(x) 3:fort= 1toTdo 4:E t ←EliteSelect(S t−1, k) 5:O t ←UniformCrossover+AdaptiveMutation(E t, pc, pm) 6:EvaluateO t via API with caching 7:S t ←ElitistReplacement(S t−1, Ot) 8:ifTargetReached or NoImprovement≥Patiencethen break 9:end if 10:end for 11:returnBest individual and run statistics 4 Experiment 4.1 General Setup and Purpose We present RAGSmith, a framework designed to systematically explore combinations of advanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques on a given dataset in order to identify the configuration that achieves the highest task performance for that dataset. To search for an optimal configuration, RAGSmith employs a genetic search algorithm, as described in Section 3.2. In 23 Table 1: Dataset Characteristics and Statistics Dataset Chunks A vg.
