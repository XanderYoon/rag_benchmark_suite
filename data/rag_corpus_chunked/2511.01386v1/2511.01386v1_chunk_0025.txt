dense embeddings across dozens of languages without per-language supervision [41, 53, 54]. Benchmarks like Mr.TyDi and MIRACL explicitly evaluate retrieval in typologically diverse, often low-resource languages [42, 51]. These works show that (a) training purely on English data and zero-shot transferring often underperforms, and (b) modest in-language supervision (or even high-quality machine translation of questions) can substantially boost recall, indicating that retrieval itself must be language-aware. Chunking and morphological normalization.In agglutinative languages such as Turkish, the same semantic unit can appear with many inflectional variants, so purely sparse retrieval (BM25) may fragment evidence. A common workaround is to either stem/lemmatize aggressively, or to rely more heavily on dense retrieval that abstracts away morphology [42, 52]. At the same time, Turkish and similar languages often exhibit freer word order, so naive heuristics for “question→ answer sentence” alignment transfer poorly from English. This affects both indexing (how you break passages) and answer extraction (what you highlight or copy back into the response). Critically, for these settings there is rarely an off-the-shelf, community-agreed “best practice” RAG recipe. Teams resort to ad hoc mixtures: translate queries to English, retrieve in English, translate back; or train a lightweight bilingual retriever on a small in-house parallel QA set; or bias chunking toward shorter spans to compensate for morphology-heavy tokens. This points to a gap: multilingual and low-resource RAG still depends on artisanal, language-specific hacks, rather than a principled search over design choices. 2.5.4 RAG over Proprietary / Internal Corpora Enterprise search, legal QA, biomedical and clinical QA, and internal engineering wikis all share two structural properties: (i) their corpora are private and often volatile, (ii) the required answers are high-stakes (compliance, patient safety, incident response). This combination makes generic public RAG recipes brittle. Enterprise & internal documentation.Corporate knowledge bases contain heterogeneous artifacts: Markdown specs, Jira tickets,
