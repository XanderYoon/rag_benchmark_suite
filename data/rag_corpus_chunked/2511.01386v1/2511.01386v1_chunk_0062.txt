genetic search proved to be an effective strategy for exploring the configuration space without requiring exhaustive evaluation. Across all datasets, the algorithm consistently identified high-performing configurations after a limited number of evaluations, demonstrating its capability to efficiently navigate the large and diverse search space. By maintaining a balanced interplay between exploration of new combinations and exploitation of promising patterns, the search process produced robust results within a reasonable computational budget, confirming the practicality of evolutionary optimization for modular RAG pipelines. The systematic absence of certain modules provides valuable insights.Passage compression was never selected, indicating the algorithm correctly learned that compression-induced information loss outweighs efficiency gains. Alternative query expansion methods (decomposition, step-back 33 prompting) were pruned in favor ofmulti-query expansion , suggesting that flexible, unrestricted query generation generalizes better than structured approaches making assumptions about query format. 5.9 Broader Implications and Design Principles The observed results reinforce several key principles for effective RAG pipeline design: RobustComponents.Theconsistentselectionof vector_retrievalforretrievaland reflection_revising for post-generation across all domains suggests these should be considered foundational components. Their effectiveness indicates they provide fundamental capabilities that benefit diverse question types and content structures. Domain-AdaptiveAugmentation.Thechoicebetweenfixed-windowaugmentation( prev_next_augmenter) and adaptive-window extraction (relevant_segment_extractor) should be guided by information density uniformity: fixed windows work well for domains with consistent relevance patterns and uniform section lengths; adaptive windows excel when articles have highly variable section lengths and information density, allowing dynamic adjustment to avoid including irrelevant context or missing relevant distant information. Density-Aware Reranking.Dataset chunk density may inform reranker selection: cross-encoders for thorough evaluation when candidate sets are small (<40 chunks/article); hybrid rerankers (cross- encoder + LLM) for computational efficiency when candidate sets are large (>50 chunks/article). These tendencies should be read qualitatively. Their strength varies with hyperparameters (k, candidate pool size), and context budget; a fuller ablation is left to future work.
