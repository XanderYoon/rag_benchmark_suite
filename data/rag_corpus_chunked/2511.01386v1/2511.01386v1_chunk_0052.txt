These variations in improvement magnitude correlate strongly with dataset characteristics and question type distributions. A detailed comparison of retrieval and generation metrics between the best-performing RAG combinations discovered by RAGSmith and the naive baseline is provided in Table 4 and Table 5. These results demonstrate that automated evolutionary search can effectively discover configurations that substantially outperform standard pipeline setups across diverse knowledge domains. 5.2 Retrieval Performance Analysis Computer Science demonstrates the most dramatic retrieval improvement (+12.5%), particularly in mAP (+14.1%) and nDCG@5 (+14.4%). This can be attributed to its lower chunk density (34.4 chunks/article) making the multi-query expansion particularly effective—fewer chunks mean that semantic diversification through query expansion can more effectively cover the search space. Wikipedia Computer Science articles tend to be concise and definition-focused (e.g., articles on specific algorithms, data structures, or programming concepts), with less narrative elaboration compared to other domains.
