or biomedical QA. We argue that the community currently discovers effective pipelines by manual, domain-specific intuition, rather than via a principled, automated search. This motivates the need for frameworks thatlearn which RAG variant is optimal for a given domain, especially for languages and sectors that lack expert-curated recipes. 2.5.1 RAG for Noisy, Informal, Short Text Many real deployments of RAG operate not over Wikipedia, but over chat transcripts, customer support tickets, incident reports, Slack channels, call-center notes, and social media posts. These sources differ from canonical IR benchmarks along several axes: utterances are short, ungrammatical, code-switched, and referential (“it broke again after the last push”); entities are local and time- sensitive (product SKUs, internal codenames); and discourse is fragmented across turns. Classical dense retrievers trained on encyclopedic QA (e.g., DPR) degrade under this distribution shift because the relevance signal in chat-like corpora is often pragmatic (conversation state, speaker identity) 11 rather than purely lexical or encyclopedic [8, 43]. Practitioners compensate with domain-tuned adaptations: (1) Custom negative sampling that treats adjacent conversation turns as “hard negatives,” forcing the retriever to discriminate between two nearly identical utterances differing only in the specific failure mode or timestamp. (2) Windowed or conversational chunking, where the retrieval unit is not a single message but a sliding block of k turns to preserve local context (also common in dialogue grounding and multi-turn customer support QA). (3) Hybrid sparse+dense retrieval, where BM25 surfaces exact lexical matches to product/version strings and a dense encoder handles paraphrastic complaints, then late-fusion ranks them jointly [43–45]. Answer generation is also specialized: instead of encyclopedic “factual” style, the target is often task-oriented (“Tell the user to reboot and open Settings”), and organizations frequently enforce grounded response templates to avoid hallucinated promises in support channels. Accordingly, post- retrieval control often includes citation-style or
