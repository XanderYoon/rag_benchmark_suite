further by letting an LLM reason step-by-step and issue retrieval calls at each step. In ReAct, the model interleaves chain-of-thought reasoning with tool calls (including retrieval), generating intermediate hypotheses and follow-up search queries [28]. This effectively learns todecomposeat inference time: the system does not just expand the original query, it plans a sequence of targeted retrieval queries that progressively narrow in on the final answer. Decomposition benefits RAG because it mitigates a known limitation of single-shot retrieval: if the first retrieval call fails to surface the key bridge entity (e.g., the founder’s name), the generator never has a chance to see it. By contrast, iterative multi-hop retrieval explicitly searches for those bridge facts and feeds them forward. This is especially important in domains where information is fragmented across many short notes or where evidence is relational (“X acquired Y, Y hired Z, Z led project Q”). 2.3.4 Implications for Automatic Query Conditioning The techniques above—query expansion and rewriting, instruction-to-intent mapping, and multi-hop decomposition—are allpre-retrieval knobs. They change not the retriever itself, but the input the retriever sees. Crucially, these knobs are domain-sensitive: •Conversational assistants benefit from context resolution and anaphora rewriting [22]. •Enterprise incident search benefits from canonicalizing slang and surfacing entity IDs. •Open-domain multi-hop QA benefits from explicit decomposition and iterative retrieval [25, 26, 28]. •Dense semantic search over short, noisy queries benefits from LLM-generated hypothetical expansions such as HyDE [21]. Because RAG answer quality is upper-bounded by what is retrieved, and retrieval is heavily influenced by how the query is phrased, these conditioning steps are not optional engineering details but central design decisions. Our broader framework treats these query-conditioning choices as part 8 of the configurable retrieval stack: rather than assuming a single “raw user question→ retriever” pathway, we explicitly acknowledge that different domains may require different pre-retrieval
