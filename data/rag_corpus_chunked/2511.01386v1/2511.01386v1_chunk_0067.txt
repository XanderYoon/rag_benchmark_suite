adoption of contextual chunk headers directly addresses the hierarchical organization of mathematical encyclopedia entries, enabling +7.5% improvement in LLM-based generation scores by preserving relationships between definitions, properties, and applications. Conversely, Medicine’s modest improvement (+1.9%) reflects the domain’s already-strong baseline performance, attributable to standardized article structures and consistent medical terminology that make even simple retrieval effective. The work also exposes important limitations that warrant future investigation. The modest improvements oninterpretation-heavy datasets indicate a fundamental challenge: these questions require reasoning capabilities that current RAG techniques cannot adequately address through improved retrieval alone. Additionally, our approach identifies complete optimal configurations without isolating individual component contributions, leaving synergistic and antagonistic interactions between modules incompletely understood. Future work incorporating factorial ablation studies could elucidate these interactions and enable more targeted optimization strategies. Looking forward, several promising research directions emerge from this work. First, the develop- ment of RAG techniques specifically designed for interpretive reasoning—potentially incorporating 36 multi-hop reasoning chains, explicit reasoning traces, or knowledge graph integration—could address the performance gap oninterpretationquestions. Second, multi-objective optimization incorporating computational cost and latency alongside performance metrics would enable practical deployment trade-offs. Third, meta-learning approaches leveraging dataset characteristics (chunk density, ques- tion distribution, content structure) could enable efficient zero-shot configuration prediction for new domains, reducing the need for domain-specific optimization. A critical methodological contribution of this work lies in optimizing complete pipeline configu- rations rather than independently selecting "best" modules from each category. Traditional RAG optimization approaches evaluate techniques in isolation—identifying the best retrieval method, best reranking strategy, and best generation approach separately—then combine these individual "winners" into a final pipeline. However, this greedy, per-module optimization ignores potential synergies and conflicts between components. Our evolutionary approach, by contrast, evaluates entire configurations holistically, allowing modules that may be suboptimal in isolation to emerge when they enhance the performance of other pipeline
