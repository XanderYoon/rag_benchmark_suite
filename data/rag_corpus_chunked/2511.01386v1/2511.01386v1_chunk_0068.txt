isolation—identifying the best retrieval method, best reranking strategy, and best generation approach separately—then combine these individual "winners" into a final pipeline. However, this greedy, per-module optimization ignores potential synergies and conflicts between components. Our evolutionary approach, by contrast, evaluates entire configurations holistically, allowing modules that may be suboptimal in isolation to emerge when they enhance the performance of other pipeline components. This configuration-level opti- mization is essential: a reranker that excels with one retrieval method may perform poorly with another, or an augmentation strategy that benefits one generation approach may hinder another. The systematic absence of certain modules despite their individual strengths (e.g., passage compres- sion, decomposition-based query expansion) demonstrates that RAGSmith correctly identifies when components that work well in isolation degrade overall pipeline performance. The modular framework and evolutionary search methodology presented here provide both a practical system for RAG optimization and a research platform for investigating how different pipeline components interact across diverse domains. As the RAG landscape continues to evolve with emerging techniques such as HyperGraph retrieval and advanced reasoning modules, RAGSmith’s extensible architecture offers a principled approach to evaluating and integrating new capabilities. By establishing that optimal RAG configurations are fundamentally domain-dependent—with improvement magnitudes varying threefold across our datasets (1.2% to 6.9%)—this work underscores a crucial insight: there is no universal RAG solution, and thoughtful, data-driven optimization tailored to dataset characteristics and question types is essential for maximizing performance in production deployments. In summary, this work contributes: (1) a holistic pipeline optimization approach that accounts for inter-component interactions rather than greedy per-module selection; (2) a question type sensitivity framework linking question distributions to optimization potential of RAG pipelines; (3) empirically- grounded design principles mapping dataset characteristics to effective module combinations; (4) identification of robust RAG components alongside domain-adaptive extensions. These contributions collectively advance our understanding of
