attributed to its lower chunk density (34.4 chunks/article) making the multi-query expansion particularly effective—fewer chunks mean that semantic diversification through query expansion can more effectively cover the search space. Wikipedia Computer Science articles tend to be concise and definition-focused (e.g., articles on specific algorithms, data structures, or programming concepts), with less narrative elaboration compared to other domains. The combination of multi_query with vector_retrieval proved especially beneficial because technical terminology can be expressed in multiple ways (e.g., "hash table" vs. "hash map" vs. "dictionary structure"), and query expansion helps capture these lexical variations. 28 Table 5: Comparison of Best vs. Baseline results across domains for LLM-based and Semantic evaluation metrics. Overall is the mean of the two for each dataset (higher is better). Additional %∆columns show relative change of Best over Baseline.

Wikipedia medical articles are typically comprehensive and well-structured, following consistent organizational patterns (e.g., symptoms, causes, diagnosis, treatment) with standardized medical terminology. This high information density (50.9 chunks/article) and terminological consis- tency means that even simple vector retrieval performs well. The high chunk density necessitated sophisticated reranking strategies (hybrid_rerank) to efficiently process large candidate sets and identify the most relevant passages among many potentially relevant sections. 5.3 Generation Performance Analysis The generation metrics reveal that improvements are primarily driven by enhanced LLM scoring rather than semantic similarity, as shown in Table 5. Mathematics demonstrates the most significant LLM score improvement (+7.5%), which directly
