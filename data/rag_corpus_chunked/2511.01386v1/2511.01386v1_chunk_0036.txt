user query is transformed or expanded to get a better query or wider query pool to retrieve more related chunks during retrieval. 1. Multi-Query Retrieval: The multi-query retriever is designed to strengthen information retrieval by generating several distinct queries for a single task. Rather than relying on one perspective, this approach captures content from different angles, reducing the risk of overlooking relevant details. Because the queries are produced through large language models, they remain contextually consistent with the user’s intent, making this method particularly valuable for complex or multi-dimensional questions. [86] 18 2. RAG Fusion: RAG Fusion integrates retrieval-augmented generation with reciprocal rank fusion to improve the ranking and selection of retrieved documents. By issuing multiple queries, it draws on a broader set of candidate results, which are then re-ordered through a rank aggregation process. The use of reciprocal rank values ensures that documents consistently identified as highly relevant across sources receive greater weight, minimizing the bias of any single retrieval method and leading to more reliable outcomes. [87] 3. Decomposition: Decomposition tackles the challenge of large or complex queries by breaking them into smaller, more manageable components. Each sub-question can be addressed with greater precision, and the results are later combined into a coherent overall response. This step-by-step process not only improves the accuracy of retrieval but also supports more effective reasoning, as the system can focus on specific aspects of the problem without being overwhelmed by its full complexity. [88] 4. Step-back Prompting: Step Back Prompting is a prompting strategy designed to strengthen the abstraction capabilities of large language models. Rather than concentrating on narrow details, the technique encourages the model to “step back” and frame the task in terms of broader principles and underlying concepts. By guiding the model toward high-level reasoning, Step Back Prompting supports more
