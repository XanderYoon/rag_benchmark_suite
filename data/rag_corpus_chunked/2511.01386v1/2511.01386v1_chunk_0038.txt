the retriever or reader. The approach introduces a rewrite–retrieve–read pipeline, where the original input is first reformulated into a clearer, more retrieval-friendly query. This reduces the mismatch between the phrasing of user inputs and the knowledge needed for retrieval, thereby improving the quality of retrieved contexts. A small trainable language model can be employed as the rewriter, refined through reinforcement learning with feedback from the LLM reader to better align queries with downstream tasks. Empirical results on open-domain and multiple-choice QA demonstrate consistent performance improvements, showing that query rewriting provides an effective and scalable means of strengthening retrieval- augmented systems. [91] 7. Graph Retrieval as Query Expansion: Graph Retrieval will be explained in detail later in Retrieval section. This method utilizes Graph Retrieval as a means to expand the query. In other words, firstly, the query is sent to a Graph Retrieval to obtain most relevant relations in the knowledge graph. Then these relations are considered as expanded queries and used similar to Multi-Query Retrieval. This method is one of the novel Advanced RAG Techniques in our comprehensive pipeline. 19 3.2.3 Retrieval Retrieval is the main part of the Retrieval component in RAG applications. It aims to retrieve the most relevant document chunks according to user query using various methods. 1. Vector Retrieval: Vector retrieval methods represent both queries and candidate documents (or chunks) as continuous embeddings in a shared semantic space, enabling similarity-based ranking based on inner products or cosine scores. By encoding semantics rather than relying on exact token overlap, vector retrieval can capture latent relationships and expand the scope of relevance beyond lexical matches. To scale this to large corpora, efficient data structures and approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithms are used to retrieve top candidates from millions or billions of vectors. Recent work has extended this paradigm
