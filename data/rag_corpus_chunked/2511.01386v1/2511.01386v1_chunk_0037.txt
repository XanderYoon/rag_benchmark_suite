complexity. [88] 4. Step-back Prompting: Step Back Prompting is a prompting strategy designed to strengthen the abstraction capabilities of large language models. Rather than concentrating on narrow details, the technique encourages the model to “step back” and frame the task in terms of broader principles and underlying concepts. By guiding the model toward high-level reasoning, Step Back Prompting supports more structured and coherent problem-solving and helps prevent it from being sidetracked by irrelevant specifics. This shift in perspective enhances conceptual understanding and allows the model to generate responses that are more accurate, logically consistent, and contextually aligned, particularly when handling complex or cognitively demanding queries. [89] 5. Hypothetical Document Embedding: The HyDE method, introduced by Gao et al. (2022), advances retrieval performance by leveraging the generative capacity of large language models. Instead of relying exclusively on direct query–document matching, HyDE prompts the model to generate a hypothetical answer that represents a plausible response to the query. This synthesized answer is then embedded and used to retrieve documents semantically aligned with the generated text. By acting as a semantic bridge, HyDE reduces dependence on surface-level keyword matches and improves the system’s ability to capture nuanced and contextually rich information. As a result, it produces more precise and semantically meaningful retrieval outcomes while illustrating the growing role of language models in embedding-based information access. [90] 6. Query Rewriting: Query Rewriting enhances retrieval-augmented generation by adapting the input query itself rather than modifying the retriever or reader. The approach introduces a rewrite–retrieve–read pipeline, where the original input is first reformulated into a clearer, more retrieval-friendly query. This reduces the mismatch between the phrasing of user inputs and the knowledge needed for retrieval, thereby improving the quality of retrieved contexts. A small trainable language model can be employed as the rewriter, refined through reinforcement
