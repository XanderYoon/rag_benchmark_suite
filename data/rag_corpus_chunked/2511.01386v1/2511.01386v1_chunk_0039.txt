cosine scores. By encoding semantics rather than relying on exact token overlap, vector retrieval can capture latent relationships and expand the scope of relevance beyond lexical matches. To scale this to large corpora, efficient data structures and approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithms are used to retrieve top candidates from millions or billions of vectors. Recent work has extended this paradigm to hybrid and multi-vector approaches but at its core, vector retrieval remains a powerful means to bridge the gap between natural language queries and richly encoded textual content. [92] 2. Keyword Search (BM25): BM25 is a classical probabilistic retrieval model that ranks docu- ments according to their estimated probability of relevance to a given query. It refines traditional keyword matching by incorporating term frequency, inverse document frequency, and document length normalization into a simple scoring function. This balance allows BM25 to weight in- formative terms more heavily while preventing overly frequent terms or long documents from dominating the ranking. Despite the rise of neural retrieval methods, BM25 remains a strong and widely used baseline due to its robustness, interpretability, and consistently competitive performance in information retrieval tasks. [93] 3. Hybrid Search (Keyword + Vector): Hybrid Search combines lexical search (e.g., BM25) with semantic search (e.g., transformer-based embeddings) to exploit the complementary strengths of both approaches. Lexical methods are efficient and precise for exact term matching but suffer from vocabulary mismatch, while semantic methods capture deeper meaning but can struggle in out-of -domain settings. By fusing their scores—through methods such as convex combinations or reciprocal rank fusion—Hybrid Search achieves more robust and effective retrieval, improving both recall and ranking quality across diverse domains. [94] 4. Graph Retrieval: Graph Retrieval enriches retrieval-augmented generation by representing documents and their relationships as a graph structure rather than treating them as isolated chunks.
