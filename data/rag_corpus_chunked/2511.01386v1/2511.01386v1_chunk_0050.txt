convergence characteristics of the run. Although the framework supports full customization, the configuration that yielded the most stable and high-performing results across experiments is summarized below. The parameters were chosen after several pilot runs and empirical tuning. Parameter Value / Method Population size 16 Number of generations 20 Crossover rate 0.6 Mutation rate 0.08 Elitism count 5 Selection method Elite Selection Crossover method Uniform Crossover Mutation method Adaptive Mutation (0.01≤rate≤0.2) Convergence threshold 100 Target fitness 1.0 Random seed 42 In this configuration, a population size of 16 and 20 generations were selected to maintain a balance between exploration capability and computational feasibility. The elitism count of 5 ensures that the top-performing solutions are preserved across generations, improving convergence stability. The Uniform Crossover with a probability of 0.6 provided strong performance in maintaining population diversity while retaining useful genetic information from parent solutions. An Adaptive Mutation strategy dynamically adjusted the mutation rate between 0.01 and 0.2 according to population diversity, balancing exploration and exploitation throughout the search. The Elite Selection method consistently led to faster and more stable convergence compared to Tournament or Rank Selection in this setup. Each genetic search run proceeded through 20 generations with an initial population of 16 individuals, resulting in approximately 100 evaluated unique configurations per run. Given the high-dimensionality of the search space (46,080 total combinations), this approach provided a computationally tractable yet highly effective strategy for identifying top-performing configurations. The integrated caching mechanism and modular GA design enabled rapid experimentation with different mutation, crossover, and selection operators, ultimately resulting in a robust and efficient optimization pipeline. 5 Results and Discussion 5.1 Main Performance Comparison Applying RAGSmith to the six distinct datasets, we obtained substantial improvements over the naive RAG baseline.
