Science requires it), suggesting limited zero-shot generalization. Transfer learning approaches or meta-learning could enable more efficient configuration adaptation to new domains, potentially using dataset characteristics (chunk density, question distribution, token statistics) as features for predicting effective configurations. Question Type Granularity.Our three-category taxonomy (factual,interpretation,long-answer) may be too coarse to capture nuances in question complexity. Finer-grained categorization (e.g., single-hop vs. multi-hop reasoning, comparison questions, causal reasoning) could reveal more targeted optimization opportunities. Rapidly Advancing RAG Techniques.RAGSmith presents a pipeline for analyzing RAG technique combinations and finding suitable combinations for given datasets. However, RAG is a rapidly advancing field and new advanced RAG techniques are developed constantly. Our pipeline proposes a framework and categorization which may welcome new techniques such as HyperGraph retrieval. Future work could extend RAGSmith with these new techniques to form a more comprehensive RAG technique analysis pipeline. 5.11 Key Contributions and Findings Holistic Pipeline Optimization.We cast RAG design as a joint, end-to-end configuration problem and optimizeentirepipelines rather than greedily selecting per-module “best” components. To tractably navigate the combinatorial space—where exhaustive grid search is impractical due to end- to-end runtime—we employ an evolutionary (genetic) search procedure that uncovers high-performing configurations under realistic compute budgets. Question-Type Sensitivity Framework.We quantify how the question-type mixture gov- erns both achievable gains and where to invest optimization effort. Datasets dominated bylong- answer/factualqueries (e.g., Computer Science: 63%, Mathematics: 66%) realize larger improvements (up to +6.9% and +5.1%), whileinterpretation-heavy domains (Medicine: 53%, Finance: 51%, Law: 49%) yield smaller deltas (+1.9%–+4.4%). This highlights a persistent gap in current RAG methods for inference-heavy reasoning. Domain-Specific Optimization Guidelines.We provide actionable mappings from data characteristics to technique choicesandsummarize the recurring design patterns surfaced by search. High chunk density/length favors cross-encoder or hybrid rerankers; non-uniform or hier- archical content benefits from adaptive windowing or segment extraction; and the question-type distribution dictates the
