text fragments.[83] 2. Parent Document Retriever: The Parent Document Retriever addresses the trade-off between semantic precision and contextual coherence in document chunking. While smaller chunks yield highly specific embeddings, they often lose connection to the broader narrative of the source text. Conversely, larger chunks preserve context but dilute the semantic relevance of fine-grained details. This method resolves the tension by embedding small, semantically focused chunks while maintaining links to their originating parent documents. During retrieval, the system surfaces both the granular chunks and their associated parent content, thereby providing precise semantic matches supplemented with broader contextual grounding. In doing so, the Parent Document Retriever enhances retrieval quality by balancing fine-grained relevance with document-level coherence. [84] 3. Hypothetical Prompt Embedding: HyPE is a retrieval enhancement method that improves alignment between user queries and relevant content in RAG systems. It operates by precomputing multiple hypothetical prompts for each document chunk during the indexing stage and embedding these prompts into the retrieval space. At inference time, user queries are matched against these stored prompts, effectively reframing retrieval as a question-to-question task. This approach strengthens semantic alignment, reduces retrieval errors caused by style mismatches, and avoids additional computational costs during query execution. Experimental results show that HyPE achieves significant gains in both precision and recall, while remaining compatible with other retrieval strategies, making it a scalable and efficient solution for large-scale RAG pipelines. [85] 3.2.2 Query Expansion Query Expansion is a process where the user query is transformed or expanded to get a better query or wider query pool to retrieve more related chunks during retrieval. 1. Multi-Query Retrieval: The multi-query retriever is designed to strengthen information retrieval by generating several distinct queries for a single task. Rather than relying on one perspective, this approach captures content from different angles, reducing the risk of
