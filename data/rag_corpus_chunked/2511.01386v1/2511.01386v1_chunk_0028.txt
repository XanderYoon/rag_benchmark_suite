bolts on FiD or naive concatenation, and hopes it generalizes. This is especially limiting in under-resourced languages (e.g., Turkish) and in siloed proprietary domains, where there is neither extensive prior art nor abundant supervised labels to guide intuition [42, 51, 56]. In summary, domain adaptation in RAG today is manual, fragmented, and expert-driven. 2.6 RAG Tooling, Orchestration Frameworks, and Auto-RAG Systems Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has moved from a research pattern to an engineering product primitive. As a consequence, there is a rapidly growing ecosystem of toolkits, orchestration libraries, and “auto-RAG” systems that aim to (i) make it easier to assemble RAG pipelines, and/or (ii) partially automate their tuning. This section situates these developments, then positions our framework as a more general, data-driven optimizer of entire RAG pipelines across domains. We organize prior work into three trends: (1) automatic RAG selection and tuning systems that try to search or adapt a RAG configuration to a task; (2) agentic, feedback-driven loops in which the LLM itself critiques retrieval and dynamically adjusts how it retrieves. We then explain how our framework differs from these works. 2.6.1 Automatic Module Search, Retriever–Generator Pairing, and Prompt / Pipeline Tuning Beyond “lego block” assembly, a parallel line of work tries toautomateparts of RAG design itself. We group these under automatic RAG configuration search and automatic evaluation / feedback for improvement. 14 AutoRAG-style pipeline search.Recent work explicitly frames RAG construction as a search or optimization problem. The AutoRAG framework proposes to “automatically identify suitable RAG modules for a given dataset,” motivated by the observation that retrieval and generation components that work for one domain (e.g., Wikipedia QA) may fail in another (e.g., domain-specific documents) [63]. AutoRAG treats the pipeline as a set of interchangeable modules (retriever type, ranker, generator prompting, etc.) and explores combinations to find high-performing variants
