represented as an array encoding the selected options for each component, and stored alongside its corresponding fitness value. For instance, a configuration such as[1 , 0, 5, 2, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1]corresponds to a fitness score of 0.8254. The array elements denote the selected indices for each configurable component, while the associated score indicates the resulting fitness value of that configuration. This caching mechanism prevented redundant evaluations of previously tested configurations and significantly improved runtime performance. The fitness score values shown in the results were computed using the formulations provided in Section 3.4, specifically Equations (1), (2), and (3). The termF (x)in those equations directly represents the fitness score employed by the genetic search algorithm. The framework was designed to support a wide range of implementations for each core component of the genetic algorithm, enabling extensive experimentation and flexibility. Specifically: •Mutation Operators:Adaptive Mutation, Random Mutation, Categorical Mutation, Swap Mutation, Inversion Mutation, and Composite Mutation were implemented. These operators vary in how they introduce diversity into the population, ranging from adaptive probability adjustments to categorical and position-based perturbations. 25 •CrossoverOperators:TheframeworksupportsSingle-PointCrossover, Multi-PointCrossover, Uniform Crossover, Order Crossover, and Segment Crossover. These operators differ in how they recombine parent chromosomes to form new offspring, allowing both localized and global genetic mixing to be explored. •Selection Methods:Several strategies were implemented, including Tournament Selection, Roulette Wheel Selection, Rank Selection, and Elite Selection. This diversity allows balancing between exploration and exploitation depending on the desired convergence characteristics of the run. Although the framework supports full customization, the configuration that yielded the most stable and high-performing results across experiments is summarized below. The parameters were chosen after several pilot runs and empirical tuning.
