used an equally weighted combination of two metrics: (i) a semantic similarity score derived from an embedding model, and (ii) an LLM-based judgment produced by a sufficiently large language model. These two metrics were likewise assigned equal weights. Beyond separately evaluating retrieval and generation performance, we introduced a unified scalar metric to improve interpretability and to act as the fitness function for the genetic search algorithm. Specifically, the overall score is defined as the mean of the retrieval and generation scores, reflecting their equal importance. 4.5 Implementation Details For the LLM generation and other techniques that require LLM capabilities, we used the latest version of Qwen235b-a22b-Instruct-2507 model. For LLM-Judge model for evaluation, we used gpt-oss-120b model. For embedding operations and similarity-score calculation we used mxbai-embed-large model. For cross-encoder reranking we used BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3. For reranking of the passages in dataset creation, we used Cohere API and rerank-v3.5 model. 4.6 Genetic Search Run and Implementation Details For our framework, a comprehensive genetic search framework was developed to explore combinations of optimization and model components efficiently. The current experimental pipeline contains a total of 46,080 possible combinations of techniques. Exhaustively testing all of these configurations would be computationally expensive; therefore, a genetic algorithm (GA) was employed to guide the search toward promising configurations. On average, each run of the genetic search evaluated approximately 100 unique combinations. To ensure efficient execution, a caching mechanism was integrated into the search process. Each evaluated configuration was represented as an array encoding the selected options for each component, and stored alongside its corresponding fitness value. For instance, a configuration such as[1 , 0, 5, 2, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1]corresponds to a fitness score of 0.8254. The array elements denote the selected indices for each configurable component, while the associated score indicates the resulting fitness value
