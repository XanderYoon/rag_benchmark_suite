contains concentrated relevant information. 5.7 Question Type Impact on Technique Effectiveness Our analysis reveals a strong inverse correlation betweeninterpretationquestion ratio and overall improvement magnitude. Datasets withinterpretationratios above 45% (Medicine: 53%, Finance: 51%, Law: 49%, Defense: 46%) show average improvement of +2.8%, while those below 40% (Computer Science: 37%, Mathematics: 34%) show average improvement of +6.0%. This pattern suggests that current RAG optimization techniques are more effective forfactual andlong-answerquestions, which benefit directly from improved retrieval precision and contextual augmentation.interpretationquestions, requiring nuanced understanding of implications and contextual inference beyond retrieved text, are less amenable to retrieval-focused optimizations. These questions likely require reasoning capabilities that current LLMs either possess or lack largely independent of retrieval quality, explaining why even sophisticated RAG configurations show limited improvement. long-answerquestions exhibit the strongest positive correlation with contextual techniques. Mathematics and Computer Science, withlong-answerratios of 41% and 33% respectively, show the largest LLM score improvements (+7.5% and +3.1%) when employingprev_next_augmenter or contextual_chunk_headers. These techniques help maintain coherence when generating com- prehensive encyclopedia-style explanations that integrate information from multiple sections of an article (e.g., combining a definition with its properties, examples, and applications into a single coherent answer). 5.8 Cross-Domain Patterns and Genetic Search Dynamics Acrossallsixdatasets, severalmodulesappearedrecurrentlyamongtopconfigurations: vector_retrieval for retrieval (6/6 datasets) andreflection_revising for post-generation (6/6 datasets). This consistency indicates that these components form a "robust RAG backbone"—a minimal set of effective building blocks that generalize well across domains with varying semantic density, question types, and content structures. The genetic search proved to be an effective strategy for exploring the configuration space without requiring exhaustive evaluation. Across all datasets, the algorithm consistently identified high-performing configurations after a limited number of evaluations, demonstrating its capability to efficiently navigate the large and diverse search space. By maintaining a balanced interplay between exploration of new combinations and exploitation of promising patterns, the
