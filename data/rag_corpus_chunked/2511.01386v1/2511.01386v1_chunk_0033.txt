Passage Filtering, Passage Augmentation, Passage Compression, Prompt Making and Post-Generation; (ii) runs these candidate pipelines on a target corpusin that corpus’s domain and language; (iii) scores them with objective metrics (retrieval metrics, LLM-Judge, semantic score); and (iv) produces an explicit ranking of which pipeline works best for that corpus. Our framework is built exactly for that role. Unlike generic orchestration libraries, it treats RAG pipeline design itself as an empirical search problem over amulti-stage space(nine different technique families), and then reports which combinations dominate on that dataset. This explicit, data-grounded model selection across different domains is, to our knowledge, not provided by existing libraries or self-tuning approaches [63, 73, 75]. 16 Despite substantial progress in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), modern systems remain fragmented: individual works improve retrieval quality [9, 17, 78], stabilize the generator through grounding and citation enforcement [7, 79, 80], or introduce query rewriting and iterative self- refinement loops that help the model ask better questions of the retriever [81, 82]. Other efforts focus on developer-facing RAG tooling and orchestration frameworks, lowering the barrier to composing pipelines but largely assuming that practitioners will hand-tune chunking, retrieval mode, filtering, and answer synthesis for their own data. Critically, none of these threads provides an end-to-end, domain-aware search procedure that, given a specific corpus,empirically discoversthe optimal RAG configuration. The framework we propose is designed to fill exactly that gap: it treats RAG not as a static architectural choice, but as a controlled design space to be searched per domain. 3 Method 3.1 Problem Statement and Scope We formalize the modular RAG design by selecting one technique (or not selecting any technique) from each of the nine RAG technique families to maximize an overall evaluation objective. Let the search space be a product of discrete sets with conditional dependencies across families. Figure 1:
