The choice betweenprev_next_augmenter (4 datasets) andrelevant_segment_extractor (2 datasets) reflects different needs for contextual window flexibility. Fixed-window augmentation (prev_next_augmenter) dominates in domains where Wikipedia articles have relatively uniform information density and consistent chunk relevance patterns: Mathematics (where related concepts are typically adjacent), Medicine (standardized article structures), Computer Science (sequential explanations), and Finance (connected economic principles). Conversely, adaptive-window extraction (relevant_segment_extractor) proves beneficial in Law and Defense Industry, where Wikipedia articles exhibit variable information density. Legal articles may have lengthy historical sections followed by brief but crucial legal provisions, while Defense Industry articles might have extensive operational history but concise technical specifications. The adaptive approach allows the system to dynamically adjust the context window size based on where relevant information is concentrated, rather than using a fixed window that might include irrelevant sections or miss relevant distant context. The long_context_reorderpromptmakerappearsinfourdatasets(Law, Mathematics, Medicine, Defense Industry), with a clear pattern: it is selected for datasets with either high chunk density (Medicine: 50.9, Defense: 50.6 chunks/article) or high average tokens per chunk (Law: 182.2, Medicine: 190.3 tokens/chunk). This reordering strategy helps manage the "lost in the middle" problem for long context windows, ensuring relevant information is positioned optimally for the LLM’s attention mechanism. 5.6 Dataset-Specific Analysis and Insights Computer Science (+6.9% overall, +12.5% retrieval).The Computer Science dataset achieved the largest improvements, driven by a synergistic combination of low chunk density (34.4 chunks/article, lowest among all datasets) and balanced question distribution (30%factual, 37%interpretation, 33%long-answer).
