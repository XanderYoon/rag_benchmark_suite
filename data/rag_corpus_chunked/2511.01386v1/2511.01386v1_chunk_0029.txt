framework proposes to “automatically identify suitable RAG modules for a given dataset,” motivated by the observation that retrieval and generation components that work for one domain (e.g., Wikipedia QA) may fail in another (e.g., domain-specific documents) [63]. AutoRAG treats the pipeline as a set of interchangeable modules (retriever type, ranker, generator prompting, etc.) and explores combinations to find high-performing variants without requiring the practitioner to manually trial every option [63]. This directly mirrors our thesis that RAG is not one-size-fits-all and must be specialized per corpus. There is also work called “Auto-RAG” (sometimes hyphenated) that focuses oniterative retrieval orchestration: instead of fixing retrieval to a single pre-answer step, an LLM actively plans and refines multiple retrieval calls, deciding what to fetch next, when to stop, and how to integrate the evidence into a final answer [64, 65]. This variant explicitly models retrieval as a loop between the LLM and the retriever, where the model autonomously reformulates queries, evaluates usefulness of retrieved passages, and terminates when it judges that it has enough evidence [64, 65]. While this work automatesquery planning and retrieval depthat inference time, it does not claim to benchmark or rank fundamentally different retrievers, chunking policies, or generators for a new dataset; instead, it teaches the model to drive an existing retrieval stack more intelligently [64]. Programmatic prompt / pipeline optimization (DSPy).DSPy is a declarative framework that treats an LLM pipeline—including RAG pipelines—as a modular program with tunable parameters instead of ad hoc prompts [66, 67]. DSPy provides “optimizers” that automatically adjust prompt templates and, in some cases, lightweight model parameters to maximize a user-defined metric such as answer accuracy or factuality [68, 69]. In other words, you specifywhatyou want (a QA module grounded in evidence, a retriever call followed by a summarizer, etc.) plus a metric, and DSPy
