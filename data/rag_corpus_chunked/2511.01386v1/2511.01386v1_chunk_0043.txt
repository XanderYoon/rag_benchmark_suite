segments. This method aims to provide language models with richer contextual input by identifying the portions of text most relevant to the query, rather than relying on fixed-length chunk boundaries. While straightforward factual queries may be resolved within a single chunk, complex questions often require synthesizing information spread across multiple sections. By dynamically constructing these extended segments, RSE ensures that retrieval captures the full context necessary for accurate and well-grounded generation. [83] 3.2.7 Passage Compression In Passage Compression, the long passages/chunks that are retrieved are summarized or refined to get smaller and more compressed ones. 1. Tree Summarize: Tree Summarize provides a hierarchical method for aggregating retrieved information in RAG pipelines. Instead of processing all retrieved passages at once, the method organizes them into smaller groups and generates summaries for each. These intermediate summaries are then progressively merged in a tree-like structure until a final comprehensive synthesis is produced. By compressing information step-by-step, Tree Summarize makes it easier to handle long contexts while ensuring that the final output reflects evidence from across the entire retrieved set. [99] 2. LLM Refining: LLM Refine adopts an iterative strategy for response synthesis in retrieval- augmented generation. The process begins with an initial draft answer constructed from a subset of retrieved passages. As additional evidence is introduced, the model revisits its prior output and refines it, modifying the response only when the new material provides stronger or corrective information. This incremental updating mechanism allows the model to build a more accurate and complete answer without discarding previously valid reasoning. [100] 3.2.8 Prompt Maker Prompt Maker combines the processed passages/chunks to finally form a context string (or prompt) ready to send to the generator for answer generation. 1. Simple Listing: Simple listing only concatenates the retrieved and processed chunks to form a list of documents.
