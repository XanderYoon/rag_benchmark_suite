density may inform reranker selection: cross-encoders for thorough evaluation when candidate sets are small (<40 chunks/article); hybrid rerankers (cross- encoder + LLM) for computational efficiency when candidate sets are large (>50 chunks/article). These tendencies should be read qualitatively. Their strength varies with hyperparameters (k, candidate pool size), and context budget; a fuller ablation is left to future work. Question-Type Awareness.Pipeline optimization effectiveness varies significantly by question type distribution. Datasets with higher proportions ofinterpretationquestions (Medicine: 53%, Finance: 51%, Law: 49%) show smaller improvements (+1.2% to +4.4%) compared to those with morefactualandlong-answerquestions (Computer Science: +6.9%, Mathematics: +5.1%). This suggests that current RAG optimization techniques primarily improve information retrieval and contextual organization, with limited impact on inferential reasoning capabilities. 5.10 Limitations and Future Directions While our results demonstrate consistent improvements across diverse domains, several limitations warrant discussion: interpretationQuestion Challenge.The modest improvements oninterpretation-heavy datasets suggest that current RAG techniques are less effective for questions requiring deep contextual understanding and inferential reasoning. Future work should explore techniques specifically designed for interpretive tasks, such as multi-hop reasoning chains, or explicit reasoning trace generation. Computational Trade-offs.Advanced techniques like parallel reranking and reflection-based revision introduce significant computational costs. While our fitness function weights performance heavily, production deployments must consider latency and resource constraints. Future work could extend the framework toward multi-objective optimization, incorporating latency and cost-awareness alongside retrieval and generation quality. 34 Limited Cross-Domain Generalization.The optimal configurations vary substantially across domains (e.g., Medicine omits query expansion while Computer Science requires it), suggesting limited zero-shot generalization. Transfer learning approaches or meta-learning could enable more efficient configuration adaptation to new domains, potentially using dataset characteristics (chunk density, question distribution, token statistics) as features for predicting effective configurations. Question Type Granularity.Our three-category taxonomy (factual,interpretation,long-answer) may be too coarse to capture nuances in question complexity. Finer-grained categorization (e.g., single-hop vs. multi-hop reasoning,
