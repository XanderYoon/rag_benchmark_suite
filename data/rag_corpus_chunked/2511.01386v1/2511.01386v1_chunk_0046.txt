given dataset in order to identify the configuration that achieves the highest task performance for that dataset. To search for an optimal configuration, RAGSmith employs a genetic search algorithm, as described in Section 3.2. In 23 Table 1: Dataset Characteristics and Statistics Dataset Chunks A vg.

Table 1 presents comprehensive statistics for each dataset. The datasets vary significantly in content density and granularity, reflecting the different nature of Wikipedia articles across domains. Medicine demonstrates the highest content volume (106,552 tokens) and chunk density (50.9 chunks/article), characteristic of comprehensive medical encyclopedia entries covering symptoms, treatments, mechanisms, and related conditions. Computer Science has the most compact representation (34.4 chunks/article, 65,157 tokens), reflecting the more focused, definition-oriented nature of technical computing articles.
