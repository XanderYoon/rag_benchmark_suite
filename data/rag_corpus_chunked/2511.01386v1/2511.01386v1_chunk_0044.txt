the model to build a more accurate and complete answer without discarding previously valid reasoning. [100] 3.2.8 Prompt Maker Prompt Maker combines the processed passages/chunks to finally form a context string (or prompt) ready to send to the generator for answer generation. 1. Simple Listing: Simple listing only concatenates the retrieved and processed chunks to form a list of documents. 2. Long Context Reorder: Long Context Reorder is designed to counteract the tendency of large language models to emphasize the beginning and end of long inputs while overlooking material in the middle. The method works by repositioning the most relevant one or two passages so that they appear at both the start and the end of the prompt. By reinforcing key content in these high-attention regions, the approach ensures that crucial information is not neglected, leading to more accurate and contextually grounded model outputs. [97] 3.2.9 Post-Generation Post-Generation acts as the final step, post-processing the answer before presenting it to the user. 1. Reflection and Revising (Self-RAG): Self-RAG introduces a retrieval framework that incor- porates self-reflection into the generation process, allowing models to critique their own outputs. The system signals the need for external evidence, assesses the relevance and support of retrieved passages, and evaluates the overall usefulness of its responses. This mechanism enables the model not only to ground its outputs in reliable sources but also to revise them for greater factual 22 accuracy and coherence. As a result, Self-RAG improves both the precision of retrieval and the trustworthiness of long-form generations across diverse tasks. [101] 3.3 Search Space Parameterization Families and options are drawn from concrete implementations registered in the repository. Each gene indexes a valid option per family; feasibility checks rule out incompatible combinations (e.g., reranking requiring retrieval outputs of sufficient size). Each gene encodes a categorical
