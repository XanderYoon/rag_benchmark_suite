Qwen-Plus with a 131K token context window; (2) Naive RAG, which retrieves documents based on the original query without structured planning; and (3) specialized long-form writing systems including STORM and CO-STORM. As shown in Table 2, DeepWriter demonstrates competitive results, particularly in coherence and organization, highlight- ing its ability to generate structured long-form content even with compact models. As illustrated in Table 3, DeepWriter achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o-based systems, validating the effectiveness of combining semantic retrieval and structured generation. Notably, incorporating title planning from DeepWriter into Qwen-Plus improves coherence, emphasizing 10 Table 2: Configuration for different systems Qwen-Plus Qwen-Plus (w titles) STORM CO-STORM DeepWriter ModelQwen-Plus Qwen-Plus GPT-4o GPT-4o Qwen2-7B SourceInternal Internal search search offline KB Generationsingle turn single turn multi-turn multi-turn multi-turn Web searchno no yes yes no Table 3: Average Performance Scores Across All Dimensions Qwen-Plus Qwen-Plus (w titles) STORM CO-STORM DeepWriter A ve Score4.92 4.88 4.88 4.68 4.64 the benefits of decomposition and guided generation. Nonetheless, DeepWriter underperforms in certain dimensions, such as Coverage and Relevance, underscoring the limitations of smaller models compared to larger LLMs in complex content generation scenarios. 5 Conclusion We introduce HetaRAG, a deep hybrid retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that op- erates over heterogeneous data stores to answer complex questions from existing knowledge bases and produce in-depth, illustrated research reports. This technical report summarizes our preliminary exploratory work and releases the corresponding open-source code. In future work, we will con- struct a multimodal hybrid-retrieval solution anchored in a knowledge graph that seamlessly unites relational, vector and full-text search databases. 11 References [1] Q.
