commonsense reasoning [31, 32]. Cross-model knowledge transfer and small-scale deployment have also become key direc- tions, with DRAG and UniRAG promoting RAG in resource-constrained environments [33, 34]. In terms of ethics and controllability, honesty-oriented controllable generation mechanisms are gaining attention, with Divide-Then-Align explicitly requiring models to be capable of responding with “I don’t know” to improve trustworthiness [10]. Additionally, human-machine collaborative and inter- active retrieval-generation systems are emerging, with CR-Planner and ChainRAG supporting multi- turn dialogue and progressive reasoning to enhance user engagement [5, 35]. Lastly, interpretability and traceability enhancements are becoming focal points, with SEAKR’s “self-aware reranking” mechanism and KiRAG’s knowledge path recording helping improve model transparency and au- ditability [36, 6]. 3 Methodolody HetaRAG focuses on handling users’ complex question-answering tasks and generating in-depth research reports by leveraging heterogeneous knowledge stores. 3.1 Data Processing In the HetaRAG system, data processing is a critical step that consists of two key phases: data parsing and data vectorization. In the data processing phase, unstructured files are transformed into semi-structured or structured data. HetaRAG supports two batch data parsing methods: Docling [37] and MinerU [38], offering flexible solutions to meet varying accuracy, structuring requirements, and document format compat- ibility. MinerU is a layout-based PDF parsing method that focuses on extracting precise text blocks, tables, and images. It analyzes the bounding box of each text block to determine the position and structure of content, preserving the layout, and providing detailed metadata for each element. In contrast, Docling is tailored for parsing high-level document structures, making it particularly suit- able for forms and reports with well-defined layouts. These parsing methods facilitate the extraction of key elements from unstructured documents, converting them into structured data for further pro- cessing. After data parsing, HetaRAG performs format conversion and content embedding on the parsed data. For the
