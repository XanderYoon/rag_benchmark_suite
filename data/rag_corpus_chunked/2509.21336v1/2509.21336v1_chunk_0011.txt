such as importing data, building graphs, and performing relationship-based searches. By leveraging Neo4j, HetaRAG can efficiently uncover and analyze complex relationships within the data, making it an essential tool for tasks that require graph-based querying and relationship extraction. 3.3 Knowledge-Graph Building HetaRAG supports two distinct knowledge graph construction methods: HiRAG [45] and LeanRAG [46], which are designed to enhance the integration of structured knowledge into the RAG pipeline and improve the system’s reasoning capabilities over complex data. HiRAG emphasizes hierarchical knowledge aggregation by constructing multi-level entity representations, thereby enabling more effective reasoning and retrieval across different levels of semantic granularity. LeanRAG focuses on generating rich entity-relation triples and organizing them into a comprehensive knowledge graph via a dynamic, multi-level hierarchy. Both approaches contribute to building coherent and scalable knowledge representations, ensuring that HetaRAG can process domain-specific information with higher efficiency and precision. For both HiRAG and LeanRAG construction, HetaRAG abstracts the process into three stages: (1) extraction of entity-relation triples, (2) knowledge graph construction, and (3) graph-based retrieval and question answering. In the first stage, two triple extraction methods are provided: one based on CommonKG and the other on GraphRAG. The CommonKG approach leverages large-scale com- monsense knowledge patterns to extract semantically meaningful triples from unstructured text. In contrast, the GraphRAG method employs LLM-guided extraction tailored for retrieval-augmented generation, enabling more context-aware representations. In the second stage, each method con- structs knowledge graphs according to its respective paradigm. HiRAG integrates knowledge hier- archically through an unsupervised layered indexing mechanism and novel bridging strategy, while LeanRAG utilizes a hierarchical graph aggregation approach to abstract fine-grained entities and relations into a semantically rich, navigable network. These graphs are subsequently used for down- stream graph-based retrieval and reasoning tasks. 3.4 Advanced Retrieval Hybrid Retrievalin HetaRAG combines vector-based retrieval(Milvus), with keyword-based search(Elasticsearch).
