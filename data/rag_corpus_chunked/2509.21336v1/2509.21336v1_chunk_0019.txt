rocket is Elon Musk. The company he later became CEO of is Tesla, whose headquarters is in Austin, Texas, USA. Query: Who is the founder of the company that launched the Falcon Heavy rocket? Where is the headquarters of the company he later became CEO of? Figure 4: The Example of DeepSearch 4.3 Deepwriter 4.3.1 Experimental Setup Dataset.To evaluate the report generation capability of HetaRAG’s DeepWriter module, we use the World Trade Report (WTR) dataset, which consists of 23 annual reports published by the World Trade Organization from 2001 to 2024. These documents serve as the offline corpus for generat- ing long-form articles in response to user queries. For evaluation, following [50, 51, 52], we adopt Prometheus2-7B[53] as the evaluation model to assess the quality of generated articles. The evalu- ation follows four dimensions—Interest Level, Coherence and Organization, Relevance and Focus, and Broad Coverage—each scored on a 1–5 scale. These criteria comprehensively measure the ef- fectiveness of DeepWriter in producing informative, coherent, and engaging reports grounded in domain-specific knowledge. Implementation Details.We employ MinerU for PDF parsing, storing the preprocessed data in Milvus along with embeddings generated by GME (gme-Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct). Visual elements such as images and tables are captioned using Qwen2.5-VL-7B, an advanced vision-language model. Qwen2-7B serves as the core language model for executing the report generation tasks. 4.3.2 Result The performance of DeepWriter is evaluated on the WTR dataset and compared against three base- lines: (1) Long-context LLMs such as Qwen-Plus with a 131K token context window; (2) Naive RAG, which retrieves documents based on the original query without structured planning; and (3) specialized long-form writing systems including STORM and CO-STORM. As shown in Table 2, DeepWriter demonstrates competitive results, particularly in coherence and organization, highlight- ing its ability to generate structured long-form content even with compact models.
