fields. This standardization facilitates unified and precise matching and retrieval in the subsequent stages of the project. Regarding embedding, HetaRAG supports two methods: text-only embedding using the BGE-m3 [39] model and multimodal embedding (text and image) using the QwenVL [40] encoder. Text embedding focuses on capturing the semantic representation of textual content, while multimodal embedding focuses on the unified encoding of both text and visual data. Both embedding methods can be used by users in different application scenarios. These operations lay the foundation for high-quality retrieval matching and efficient querying, ensuring optimal performance in later stages of the system. 3.2 Database Construction To support the efficient storage and management of various data types, HetaRAG integrates four distinct database systems: Elasticsearch [41], Milvus [42], MySQL [43], and Neo4j [44]. Each of these databases supports specific operations and is tailored to particular use cases, ensuring that HetaRAG can handle structured and unstructured data on a scale. Elasticsearch is a distributed search engine designed for real-time retrieval and full-text search, sup- porting efficient document indexing and querying. It is used for keyword-based searches across large volumes of text data. Indexes documents in a structured format, enabling efficient real-time retrieval of relevant information. The project supports operations such as index creation, keyword search, and index deletion, as well as uploading and indexing of new data in PKL format. Once the index is established, users can perform fast and accurate search queries, retrieving optimal results based on specific keywords, thereby improving overall retrieval performance and user experience when handling large, unstructured datasets. Milvus serves as a vector database, optimized for storing and performing similarity searches on high- dimensional embeddings. It is utilized to store embeddings generated during the data processing stage in a structured format, enabling vector similarity search across high-dimensional data. The system supports
