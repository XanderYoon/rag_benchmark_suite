section provides valuable insights into the strengths and potential improvements of the system. 8 4.1 RAG-Challenge 4.1.1 Experimental Setup Dataset.To assess the retrieval and reasoning capabilities of HetaRAG, we adopt the dataset and evaluation protocol from the Enterprise RAG Challenge Round 2[49]. The benchmark comprises domain-specific queries paired with gold-standard answers annotated by experts, along with relevant document contexts.Evaluation follows the RAG Challenge metrics, including the Retrieval Score (R) and Generation Score (G) and Score = R/3 + G (max 133), reflecting both retrieval accuracy and answer generation quality. Implementation Details.We conduct experiments using the pipeline designed by Ilya Rice for this dataset, which incorporates Docling for PDF parsing, BGE-m3 for data embedding, and Milvus for constructing the vector database. Multiple large language models, such as Qwen2.5-72B and GPT- 4o, are employed for answer generation. Additionally, the system supports various large model frameworks, including API keys, vLLM, and Ollama. 4.1.2 Result Table 1 presents the experimental results of the HetaRAG system on the RAG-Challenge dataset, highlighting the effects of reranking strategies and query rewriting across two large language mod- els: ChatGPT-4o and Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct. Among all configurations, ChatGPT-4o combined with the bge-reranker-large achieved the highest overall score (117.0), demonstrating that reranking significantly enhances both retrieval (R) and generation (G) performance. For Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, the best result (109.8) was also obtained using reranking with bge- reranker-v2-gemma, outperforming its baseline configuration by over 3 points. These findings con- firm that rerankers contribute more substantially to performance gains than query rewriting and that the choice of reranker model affects overall effectiveness. The results also suggest that, while com- pact models like Qwen2.5 perform competitively, ChatGPT-4o maintains a notable advantage in generation quality when enhanced with proper reranking strategies.
