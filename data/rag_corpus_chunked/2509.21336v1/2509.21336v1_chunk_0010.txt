based on specific keywords, thereby improving overall retrieval performance and user experience when handling large, unstructured datasets. Milvus serves as a vector database, optimized for storing and performing similarity searches on high- dimensional embeddings. It is utilized to store embeddings generated during the data processing stage in a structured format, enabling vector similarity search across high-dimensional data. The system supports operations such as collection creation, index addition, data insertion, and similarity querying, ensuring that the processed data is efficiently stored and retrieved. By leveraging Milvus, HetaRAG facilitates rapid and accurate retrieval of semantically similar content, which is essential 5 for handling large-scale, vectorized data and optimizing performance in tasks such as information retrieval and content matching. MySQL is a relational database management system that facilitates the storage of structured data in tables, supporting complex queries such as filtering, aggregation, and joins. It is used to store struc- tured data, particularly formatted data (e.g., tabular data), and supports operations such as database and table creation, data import, and complex query execution to enable efficient querying of struc- tured data. By leveraging MySQL, HetaRAG ensures fast and reliable access to formatted data and facilitates complex analytical queries within the system. Neo4j is a graph database that models data as nodes and relationships, offering powerful capabilities for representing and querying complex relational data. It is used to store and manage graph-based data, enabling efficient querying of relationships between entities. The system supports operations such as importing data, building graphs, and performing relationship-based searches. By leveraging Neo4j, HetaRAG can efficiently uncover and analyze complex relationships within the data, making it an essential tool for tasks that require graph-based querying and relationship extraction. 3.3 Knowledge-Graph Building HetaRAG supports two distinct knowledge graph construction methods: HiRAG [45] and LeanRAG [46], which are designed to enhance the
