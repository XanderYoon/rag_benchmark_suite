providing accurate and multimodal information, large language models can better perform infor- mation extraction, retrieval matching, and content generation—ultimately improving the efficiency and quality of knowledge processing. Despite the availability of several knowledge engine products, these systems still exhibit notable limitations. For instance, they are primarily designed for individual users uploading small volumes of documents, with limited scalability in document processing. Moreover, most rely on vector simi- larity matching and keyword-based retrieval, which often result in low precision. Their multimodal processing capabilities remain rudimentary, failing to meet the growing demand for cross-modal integration. Modern knowledge bases must go beyond simple storage and retrieval functions. They should support advanced features such as knowledge reasoning, dynamic updating, and data privacy protection to cater to diverse application scenarios across industries. Additionally, the construction and optimization of knowledge bases are ongoing processes that require continuous user feedback and iterative improvements. In this technical report, we present HetaRAG, a hybrid, deep-retrieval RAG framework that unifies multiple heterogeneous data stores—vector indices, knowledge graphs, full-text search engines, and relational databases. The pipeline proceeds in two phases. First, we perform multimodal document ingestion that extracts text, images, tables, and mathematical formulae from raw files. Each modality is then transformed into the most appropriate storage format: dense vectors for semantic proximity, symbolic triples for relational precision, inverted indices for lexical recall, and normalized tables for transactional integrity. Second, at generation time, the system orchestrates evidence from these disparate stores to answer user questions or synthesize comprehensive, multi-modal research reports. The open-source release of HetaRAG currently offers the following core features: •Multimodal document parsing: decomposing the input document into semantically dis- tinct segments—text, images, tables, mathematical formulas, etc. •Heterogeneous storage index construction: simultaneous indexing into vector databases, knowledge graphs, full-text engines, and relational databases. •Deep research report generation: transforms unstructured
