knowledge hier- archically through an unsupervised layered indexing mechanism and novel bridging strategy, while LeanRAG utilizes a hierarchical graph aggregation approach to abstract fine-grained entities and relations into a semantically rich, navigable network. These graphs are subsequently used for down- stream graph-based retrieval and reasoning tasks. 3.4 Advanced Retrieval Hybrid Retrievalin HetaRAG combines vector-based retrieval(Milvus), with keyword-based search(Elasticsearch). This approach enables more accurate and comprehensive search results by integrating the strengths of both retrieval methods. The system utilizes a parameter, alpha, to con- trol the weight of each retrieval method, allowing for fine-tuning of the balance between vector search and keyword search. By merging the semantic power of vector-based search and the pre- cision of keyword matching, Hybrid Retrieval ensures that relevant content is effectively retrieved, optimizing performance across a wide range of queries and enhancing retrieval accuracy. Rerankingin HetaRAG provides a flexible reranking framework that further optimizes search re- sults through reranking of retrieved content. The system supports various reranking techniques, such as vLLM deployment, Hugging Face model downloads, and direct API calls. The reranking pro- cess allows for the selection of the most relevant results based on additional context and relevance, thereby improving the quality of the retrieved content. This flexibility enables users to choose from a 6 variety of reranking models, whether downloaded from external repositories or deployed locally. By supporting parent document retrieval and vector-based database systems like Milvus, the reranking mechanism enhances the accuracy and relevance of the final search results, fostering more precise and customized outcomes. 3.5 DeepSearch Question Reasoning System Search System Extract Information If the Question Can Be Answered ?
