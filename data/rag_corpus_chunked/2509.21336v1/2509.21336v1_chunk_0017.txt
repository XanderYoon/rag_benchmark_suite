The results also suggest that, while com- pact models like Qwen2.5 perform competitively, ChatGPT-4o maintains a notable advantage in generation quality when enhanced with proper reranking strategies.

Each query is designed to require multi-step retrieval, cross-document inference, and entity disambiguation, closely reflecting real-world knowledge-intensive tasks. The accompa- nying document set spans diverse but interconnected facts, enabling controlled testing of iterative querying, memory accumulation, and query rewriting. Result.As shown in Figure 4, the DeepSearch module conducts deep iterative search by decom- posing the query into focused sub-questions. It effectively leverages retrieved information to update 9 memory, enabling cross-document reasoning and evidence accumulation. This result demonstrates DeepSearch’s ability to perform deep semantic search and dynamically utilize intermediate findings to construct accurate, well-supported answers. founder of the company that launched the Falcon Heavy rocket Documents ID 1 : Elon Musk is also the founder of Neuralink and The Boring Company.
