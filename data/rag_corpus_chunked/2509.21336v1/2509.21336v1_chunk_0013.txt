relevance of the final search results, fostering more precise and customized outcomes. 3.5 DeepSearch Question Reasoning System Search System Extract Information If the Question Can Be Answered ? Memory System NO YES Answer DeepSearch Figure 2: The Framework of DeepSearch The DeepSearch component in HetaRAG is designed to address complex queries that require multi- step retrieval and iterative reasoning across diverse information sources. This component integrates semantic retrieval, information extraction, and critical reasoning to iteratively gather and synthesize information, ultimately providing accurate answers. The process is structured in multiple reasoning steps, where each stage refines the search and reasoning process based on intermediate results. The core of the system is the MultiHopAgent—a structured, iterative retrieval-and-reasoning agent whose design is adapted from the WebWalker framework proposed by [47]. The overall framework is illustrated in Figure 2. Initially, the agent rewrites the query to refine its scope and context. Based on the rewritten query, the system performs a search to retrieve relevant documents. The retrieved content is then analyzed, and key information is extracted. The system compares the extracted information with the original query to assess whether the current content is sufficient to answer the question. If the information is inadequate, the system generates new queries derived from the search results and restarts the retrieval process. This cycle of search, analysis, comparison, and refinement continues until the system generates a comprehensive and accurate answer to the original question. Through this multi-step approach, the MultiHopAgent ensures that the generated answer is well- supported by relevant and contextually consistent information. The retrieval process in MultiHopAgent supports multiple data sources, such as pre-constructed knowledge bases and web pages, ensuring that the system can retrieve contextual information from diverse repositories. By integrating various search mechanisms, the multi-hop reasoning framework provides a robust solution for addressing complex
