reasoning [24].VaLiK leverages vision-language models for image-text alignment and semantic verification, enabling unla- beled multimodal knowledge graph construction to enhance LLM reasoning [25]. CoRE Framework focuses on structured data processing (e.g., tables), generating experience trajectories via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and combining contrastive prompt design to enhance model reasoning [26]. Additionally, PIC chunking method proposes pseudo-instruction-based semantic segmenta- tion without training, significantly optimizing document splitting and improving retrieval and QA 3 performance [27]. These studies mark RAG’s shift from single-text modalities toward multi-modal, fine-grained, and structured input. 2.6 Interpretability, Honesty, and Controllable Generation To enhance transparency and reliability, multiple studies focus on interpretability, honesty, and con- trollable generation. Judge-as-a-Judge proposes filtering high-quality samples using judgment con- sistency for training, improving evaluation fairness [28]. CTRLA introduces representation-space intervention mechanisms, guiding honesty and monitoring confidence to make models more likely to acknowledge knowledge limitations and avoid false generation [8]. EXIT Mechanism proposes context-aware sentence-level compression to improve long-context processing efficiency while re- ducing interference [29]. Additionally, Debate-Augmented RAG introduces a multi-agent debate mechanism to enhance objectivity and diversity in generated content [30]. These methods form the foundation for RAG’s evolution toward trustworthy AI, controllable generation, and ethical compli- ance . 2.7 Application Expansion and Future Trends As RAG technology matures, its application scenarios are expanding into healthcare, education, law, and other fields. Medical and knowledge-intensive task applications have become hotspots, with RARE and TC–RAG achieving significant results in medical QA and commonsense reasoning [31, 32]. Cross-model knowledge transfer and small-scale deployment have also become key direc- tions, with DRAG and UniRAG promoting RAG in resource-constrained environments [33, 34]. In terms of ethics and controllability, honesty-oriented controllable generation mechanisms are gaining attention, with Divide-Then-Align explicitly requiring models to be capable of responding with “I don’t know” to improve trustworthiness [10]. Additionally, human-machine
