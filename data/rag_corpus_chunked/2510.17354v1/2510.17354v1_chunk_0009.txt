sampled chunk 𝑑𝑖, whether text- only or containing images, we use a VLM to generate up to five context-independent raw QA pairs (𝑞raw 𝑖 𝑗 , 𝑎raw 𝑖 𝑗 ), ensuring that each question can be answered solely based on its associated chunk. For chunks with images, we specifically prompt the VLM to create questions that reference the visual content. Since the model outputs text only, we use special tags such as <image k> to denote the 𝑘-th image within the chunk. This process produces the raw QA dataset Draw ={(𝑑 𝑖, 𝑞raw 𝑖 𝑗 , 𝑎raw 𝑖 𝑗 )}, which contains diverse samples ranging from pure text to multi-image questions, thereby enriching the modality diversity ofNyxQA.

Therefore, we perform a three-stage post-processing procedure on the raw data to produce the finalNyxQAdataset. • Error Filtering.Questions with explicit contextual refer- ences (e.g., phrases like “in this document”) are removed using rule-based filters. In addition, we ensure image–text consistency by verifying that the image tags mentioned in the generated question correspond to actual images present in the chunk𝑑 𝑖. • QA Refinement.We further
