sim- ilarity with temperature hyperparameter 𝜏> 0. Here,h +(𝑑𝑘 ) and h− (𝑑𝑘 ) 𝑛 correspond to the positive and the 𝑛-th negative sample document embeddings, respectively. The final training objective aggregates the InfoNCE losses over all truncated dimensions as a weighted sum: LMRL = 𝐾∑︁ 𝑘=1 𝑤 𝑘 · L(𝑑𝑘 ) Info ,where 𝐾∑︁ 𝑘=1 𝑤 𝑘 =1,(2) with 𝑤 𝑘 denoting the weight for the 𝑘-th dimension. This objective encourages each embedding prefix to preserve semantic integrity under varying retrieval constraints. Stage 1: Pretraining with Mixed-Modal Data.In the first stage, we pretrainNyxas a general-purpose retriever using a large-scale corpus constructed from both public and synthetic data sources. Following mmE5 [2], we include MMEB [24] and synthetic triplets from the mmE5 pipeline. To ensure the model’s ability to handle genuinely mixed-modal scenarios, we further integrate our proposedNyxQAdataset, which supports retrieval across diverse modality combinations. Since real-world retrieval tasks still predominantly involve tex- tual inputs, we further enhance the retriever’s text understanding ability by introducing additional text-only datasets. Specifically, we use the training sets from HotpotQA [49], 2WikiMultiHopQA [19], and MuSiQue [44]. For each query, we retrieve the top-𝐾 documents from the full Wikipedia corpus using E5-v2 [45], and treat the top-1 document as the positive sample, while selecting negative samples from documents ranked beyond top-10. All the datasets described above are combined and jointly used to train the initial retriever, resulting in theNyx-pretrained model. Stage 2: Supervised Fine-tuning with VLM-Guided Feedback. WhileNyx-pretrained demonstrates strong retrieval performance, it is not explicitly optimized for supporting downstream generation by VLMs. To bridge this gap, we introduce a fine-tuning stage that leverages feedback from a VLM to align the retriever with the actual information needs during generation.
