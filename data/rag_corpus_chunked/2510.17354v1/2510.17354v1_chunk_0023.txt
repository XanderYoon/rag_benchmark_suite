played Vi in the series "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" (2003) and Dr. Holly Marten in "Eureka" (2011), and had a recurring role as Charlie Bradbury on "Supernatural" (2012–2015, 2018). She has also acted in movies such as "Bring It On Again" (2004), as well as the Internet musical "Dr. Horrible\'s Sing-Along Blog" (2008). In April 2017, she began appearing as Kinga Forrester in "Mystery Science Theater 3000". camera Felicia Day microphone Question: What object is in front of Felicia Day's face? mmE5 Nyx Nyx-Pretrained Qwen-2.5-VL-7B-Instruct Felicia Day Figure 7: Case study on MMQA.

Effective alignment is crucial in bridging semantic gaps across VLMs. 5.4 Effect of MRL In real-world retrieval systems, reducing embedding dimensions can significantly decrease memory usage and speed up retrieval. To adapt to varying resource budgets, we incorporate MRL into our contrastive training framework. MRL ensures the model maintains meaningful representations across reduced dimensions. We train the model to generate effective embeddings at four target dimen- sions: 2048, 1024, 512, and 256, with weights of [1.0, 1.0, 0.2, 0.2] (before normalization), where 2048 is the default VLM output. As shown in Table 3, the 1024-dimensional variant achieves accuracy comparable to the 2048 one while halving storage, and even the 512- and 256-dimensional versions maintain strong per- formance. These results highlight MRL’s ability to provide efficient, resource-aware retrieval with graceful performance degradation under limited memory or latency budgets.
