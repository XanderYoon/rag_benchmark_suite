we vary the number of documents fed into Qwen2.5- VL-7B from 0 to 16, evaluating the URAG results ofmmE5,Nyx- pretrained, andNyx. As shown in Figure 5(a), adding more doc- uments consistently improves all retrievers, though the gains di- minish as the count increases.Nyxconsistently outperforms both Nyx-pretrained and mmE5, demonstrating robust performance even with fewer documents and confirming the effectiveness of feedback-based fine-tuning in producing informative retrievals. Overall, the results highlight the critical importance of high-quality top-ranked retrieval for efficient generation. 5.3 Generalization Across Generators WhileNyxis fine-tuned with supervision from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, we also examine whether such supervision generalizes to other VLMs. To assess this, we evaluate its performance across InternVL3 models of varying sizes used as generators. As shown in Figure 5 (b),Nyx consistently outperforms the direct-answer baseline across all In- ternVL3 variants, indicating that supervision from Qwen2.5-VL-7B transfers effectively across different generator architectures. Inte- gratingNyxyields further improvements, particularly for InternVL3- 2B and InternVL3-14B, with absolute gains exceeding 0.2 points. However, the degree of improvement varies with generator size, indicating different alignment preferences among models.
