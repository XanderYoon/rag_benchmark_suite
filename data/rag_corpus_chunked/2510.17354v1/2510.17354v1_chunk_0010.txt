three-stage post-processing procedure on the raw data to produce the finalNyxQAdataset. • Error Filtering.Questions with explicit contextual refer- ences (e.g., phrases like “in this document”) are removed using rule-based filters. In addition, we ensure image–text consistency by verifying that the image tags mentioned in the generated question correspond to actual images present in the chunk𝑑 𝑖. • QA Refinement.We further refine the filtered QA pairs using a VLM to enhance clarity and completeness. Each re- tained pair (𝑞raw 𝑖 𝑗 , 𝑎raw 𝑖 𝑗 ) is compressed to its essential content, eliminating redundancy while preserving factual accuracy. This process yields concise, self-contained questions and answers that align closely with the corresponding gold doc- ument𝑑 + 𝑖 , resulting in the refined set(𝑑 + 𝑖 , 𝑞𝑖 𝑗, 𝑎+ 𝑖 𝑗). • Option Generation.For each refined QA, an LLM gener- ates three semantically plausible distractors {𝑎− 𝑖 𝑗 } for the question 𝑞𝑖 𝑗. After shuffling the distractors with the correct answer, we finalize each sample with the question, four op- tions, and the gold document, forming our multiple-choice datasetD NyxQA ={(𝑞 𝑖 𝑗,{𝑎 + 𝑖 𝑗, 𝑎− 𝑖 𝑗 }, 𝑑+ 𝑖 )}. Hard Negative Mining.To enhance retriever pretraining, we construct contrastive triplets usingDNyxQA. Each question𝑞𝑖 𝑗 serves as a query, with its corresponding gold document 𝑑 + 𝑖 designated as the positive sample. We then employ mmE5 [2] to retrieve the top- 10 relevant documents from the mixed-modal corpus Cmix. From these, we select five documents that differ from 𝑑 + 𝑖 as hard nega- tives {𝑑 − 𝑖 𝑗 }, prioritizing the highest-ranked candidates. This yields the pretraining dataset Dpretrain ={(𝑞 𝑖 𝑗, 𝑑+ 𝑖 ,{𝑑 − 𝑖 𝑗 })} , a contrastive training set specifically designed for mixed-modal retrieval. 3.3Nyx: Training Paradigm Overview.Our goal is to build
