Formally, it can be represented as:𝑥∈ {𝑎 1𝑎2 . . . 𝑎𝑛 |𝑎 𝑖 ∈ {T,I}}. To effectively accomplish this task, we presuppose access to amixed-modal corpus C. A retriever is required to retrieve a relevant subset ofdocuments R (𝑞) ⊆ C , conditioned on a mixed- modalquestion 𝑞. The retrieved content then serves to guide the generation of the ultimate textual response. Formally, the objective is to learn a retrieval function R and a generation model G such that: 𝑦=G (𝑝, 𝑞,R (𝑞)) , where 𝑝 denotes a textual prompt, 𝑞 is the mixed-modal query, and R (𝑞) represents the set of retrieved documents. The output𝑦 is anatural-language textual response. The retrieval function R selects the top-𝐾 most relevant entries from the corpusCbased on their relevance to the query𝑞: R (𝑞)=TopK 𝑑∈ C sim(𝑞, 𝑑), where 𝑑 denotes a document in the mixed-modal corpus andsim(·,·) is a similarity-based relevance function defined within the joint vision-language embedding space. The generation model G, typically instantiated as a VLM, pro- cesses both the query 𝑞 and the retrieved documents R (𝑞) to yield a coherent and factually grounded textual output𝑦. 3.2NyxQA: A Dataset for URAG To simulate a realistic web environment, we introduceNyxQA, a large-scale mixed-modal dataset designed for the URAG setting. Our dataset comprises three components: (1) a high-quality multiple- choice QA dataset DNyxQA with mixed-modal questions, (2) a corre- sponding mixed-modal document corpus Cmix, and (3) a contrastive pretraining set Dpretrain containing positive and hard negative ex- amples for retriever training. The construction ofNyxQAfollows a four-stage pipeline. First, we sample and segment web
