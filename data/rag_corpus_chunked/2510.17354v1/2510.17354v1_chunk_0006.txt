leveraged VLMs as general-purpose encoders for text, images, and image-text pairs. Other studies have focused on using synthetic data [2, 54, 56] and improving contrastive learning objectives [29, 43] to enhance em- bedding quality. Building on this, MME [53] utilized synthetic data to improve performance on interleaved text-image retrieval in the wikiHow task. However, these methods lack support for text-to-text and general interleaved text-image retrieval in URAG scenarios. Moreover, most retrievers are trained independently of downstream VLMs, resulting in suboptimal alignment. Therefore, this paper proposes a unified retriever,Nyx, which builds a bridge for mixed- modal to mixed-modal retrieval, leading to better alignment with VLM generation. 3 Methodology 3.1 Problem Formulation: URAG This work addresses the task ofUniversal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (URAG), which aims to generate high-quality textual responses to mixed-modal queries by retrieving and leveraging relevant information from a mixed-modal corpus. Amixed-modal content 𝑥 is defined as an ordered sequence of elements, where Towards Mixed-Modal Retrieval for Universal Retrieval-Augmented Generation WWW ’26, April 13–17, 2026, Dubai, UAE Step1:WebDocSampling Question1Answer1AnswernQuestionn Real-WorldWebPages … … Sampling&Chunking GoldenDoc Step4:HardNegativeMining Question:What is the title of the track mentioned in this document?Answer: Blackburn explains the value by giving potential … and the impact of limited flat …housing development.Answer is overly long and difficult to evaluate.
