Compared to mmE5,mmE5-Qwen2.5-3Bperforms worse across all capabilities, which can be attributed to its smaller backbone size and the exclusion of the classification subset from the mmE5 synthetic data (to maintain alignment withNyx-pretrained and Nyxsettings). Nevertheless, it still surpasses other baseline mod- els. When OOD pure text data andNyxQAmixed-modal data are included, the mismatch with the MMEB evaluation pattern results in a 1.5% overall performance drop. However, after fine- tuning with feedback from a VLM on OOD datasets with entirely different tasks,NyxoutperformsmmE5-Qwen2.5-3Bacross all ca- pabilities, achieving a 2.1% overall improvement. These findings further demonstrate that incorporating VLM feedback not only improves the performance of URAG systems but also enhances the embedding capability of dense retrievers themselves. 5 Quantitative Analysis 5.1 Impact of Data Scale on URAG Performance The scalability of training data is crucial for building effective re- trievers. Prior studies have shown an approximately logarithmic- linear relationship between the volume of training data and the quality of retrieval model embeddings [2, 16]. In this section, we further examine how the scale of training data affectsNyx’s per- formance in the URAG setting. As illustrated in Figure 4, the performance trend closely follows a logarithmic-linear curve, consistent with previous findings. The steady improvement of URAG performance with increasing data scale further confirms the
