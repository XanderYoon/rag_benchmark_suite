each training instance as a triplet {𝑞, 𝑑+,{𝑑 − 𝑛 }𝑁 𝑛=1}, where 𝑞 is a query, 𝑑 + is a positive document, and {𝑑 − 𝑛 } are 𝑁 negative documents. An instruction string is prepended to each query before encoding. Both queries and documents may come from mixed modalities (e.g., text, image, or interleaved image-text), allowingNyxto operate in a unified embedding space. To learn discriminative representations, we adopt the InfoNCE loss for contrastive learning. Leth 𝑞 ∈R 𝑑,h + ∈R 𝑑, and {h− 𝑛 }𝑁 𝑛=1 ⊂ R𝑑 denote the embeddings of the query, the positive document, and the negative documents, respectively. We apply Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) [ 28], which encourages the full Towards Mixed-Modal Retrieval for Universal Retrieval-Augmented Generation WWW ’26, April 13–17, 2026, Dubai, UAE embeddingh ∈R 𝑑 to remain informative even when truncated to lower-dimensional subspaces. This enables flexible trade-offs between retrieval performance and memory efficiency. Specifically, for a set of target dimensions{𝑑1, 𝑑2, . . . , 𝑑𝐾 }, where 𝑑𝑘 <𝑑 , we truncate each embedding to its first 𝑑𝑘 dimensions, denoted ash (𝑑𝑘 ) ∈R 𝑑𝑘 . For each 𝑑𝑘, we compute an InfoNCE loss as: L (𝑑𝑘 ) Info =−log 𝜙(h (𝑑𝑘 ) 𝑞 ,h +(𝑑𝑘 ) ) 𝜙(h (𝑑𝑘 ) 𝑞 ,h +(𝑑𝑘 ) ) + Í𝑁 𝑛=1 𝜙(h (𝑑𝑘 ) 𝑞 ,h − (𝑑𝑘 ) 𝑛 ) ,(1) where 𝜙( a, b)=exp (sim(a,b)/𝜏 ), and sim(·,·) denotes cosine sim- ilarity with temperature hyperparameter 𝜏> 0. Here,h +(𝑑𝑘 ) and h− (𝑑𝑘 ) 𝑛 correspond to the positive and the 𝑛-th negative sample document embeddings, respectively. The final training objective aggregates the InfoNCE losses over all truncated dimensions as a weighted sum: LMRL = 𝐾∑︁ 𝑘=1 𝑤 𝑘 · L(𝑑𝑘 ) Info ,where 𝐾∑︁ 𝑘=1 𝑤 𝑘 =1,(2) with
