The U.S entered for two main rea- sons: one was that the Germans had declared unlimited German submarine warfare and the Zimmermann note.The German had totally disregarded the in- ternational laws protecting neutral nation’s ships by sinking neutral ships.his note was the last straw, causing Wilson to join the war. The Zimmermann note and unlimited German submarine warfare were two of the biggest cause for the U.S to join the Allies and go to war with Germany. During the war Germany... 2 most extreme deltas, which may be outliers). Firstly, for query 527433 (‘types of dysarthria from cerebral palsy’), ColBERT identifies a passage that clearly answers the query; in contrast, the non-relevant passage identified at rank 2 by ANCE appears to have focused solely on the ‘cerebral palsy’ aspect, omitting the dysarthria aspect of the query. Indeed, the Precision @10 of ANCE for this query was 3 10, compared to 6 10 for ColBERT. This suggests that ANCE’s compression of a complex information need into one embedding has caused an information loss, with the model focusing on only a single aspect of the query, resulting in low
