information and dependencies of the different tokens composing a query in a single embedding. On the other hand, multiple representations – using one embedding per query token together with additional masked tokens – can encode more diverse semantic information in the different embeddings, allowing to retrieve more relevant documents for queries that are hard to answer. Table 3 Comparative performances w.r.t. BM25; queries are classified based on BM25 performance (easy/ medium/hard); Wins and Losses as well as Reward and Risk are calculated w.r.t. BM25 performance.

Per-query Comparison To address RQ3, in Figure 1 we present a per-query histogram comparing the ΔNDCG@10 between ColBERT and ANCE on the TREC 2019 query set; positive deltas indicate a higher NDCG@10 for ColBERT than ANCE. In total, ColBERT outperform ANCE for 24 queries, while the opposite was true for 17 queries; Δs less than 0.15 are omitted for clarity. On analysing Figure 1, it appears that many queries requesting adefinition appear to perform well for
