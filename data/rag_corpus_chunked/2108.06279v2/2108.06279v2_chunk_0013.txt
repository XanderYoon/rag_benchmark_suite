between ColBERT and ANCE on the TREC 2019 query set; positive deltas indicate a higher NDCG@10 for ColBERT than ANCE. In total, ColBERT outperform ANCE for 24 queries, while the opposite was true for 17 queries; Δs less than 0.15 are omitted for clarity. On analysing Figure 1, it appears that many queries requesting adefinition appear to perform well for ColBERT (e.g. 1124210, 490595). Indeed, on closer inspection of the TREC 2019 query set, out of 43 queries, we found 19 such definitional queries – of which 16 were more effective for ColBERT. To illustrate other differences between the approaches, in Table 4 we select two non-definitional queries where one approach markedly outperformed the other (but not the queries with the Table 4 Examples of passages retrieved by ANCE and ColBERT at top ranks. The Label column contains the assessment of that document for that query in the qrel file, with – denoting unjudged.

Speech impairments in spastic dysarthria involves four major abnormalities of voluntary movement: spasticity, weakness, limited range of motion and slowness of movement. 3 8306451 ANCE 2 The types of cerebral palsy are: 1 spastic: the most common type of cerebral palsy; reflexes are exaggerated and muscle movement is stiff. 2 dyskinetic: dyskinetic cerebral palsy is divided into two categories. 0 ANCE > ColBERT 1063750: why did the us volunterilay enter ww1 1300452 ColBERT 2 The main event that led the US to entering ww2 was Japan bombing Pearl Harbor.
