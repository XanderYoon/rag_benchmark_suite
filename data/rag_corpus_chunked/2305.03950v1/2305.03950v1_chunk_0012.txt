to no augmentation. As shown in the figure, even a small value of 𝛼 (0.01) leads to a significant improvement in both R@2kt and R@5kt. The best effectiveness is achieved when 𝛼 = 0.02. However, using higher values of 𝛼 does not result in further improvements – rather, it can even hurt the effectiveness when 𝛼 > 0.05. Based on these results, we conclude that the augmentation ratio in our embedding aggregation function has a significant impact on the effectiveness of xDR, and using a small value of 𝛼 can be beneficial for improving effectiveness. Figure 4: R@2kt for target languages (rows) augmented by source generated queries (columns). We plot 𝛼 from 0 to 0.1 with step size of 0.01 (x axis). Statistically significant better results with respect to no augmentation (𝛼 = 0) are labelled with stars ( 𝑝 < 0.05). 5.4 RQ3: Impact of each languages In the previous experiments we used all the queries generated for a passage to augment the original passage embedding, irrespective of language of the generated query. Next, we investigate the impact on effectiveness of using generated queries from each of the languages separately. We analyze this in Figure 4, where we plot R@2kt for each target language (rows) against different values of 𝛼 (x-axis). The plots in the diagonal show that xDR effectiveness improves when passage embeddings are augmented with generated queries for the same language. Notably, we observe that the best value of𝛼 varies across different languages, and the improvements in effective- ness are not always statistically significant. We also observe that, for some languages, queries generated for other languages can improve the effectiveness of target queries in a different language. For instance, using queries generated for Japanese (Ja) can improve the effectiveness of target queries in Korean (ko), while using
