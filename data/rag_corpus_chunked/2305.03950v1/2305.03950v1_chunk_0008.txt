We evaluate the effectiveness of our ap- proach and baselines using recall at 𝑚 kilo-tokens (R@𝑚kt), which is the dataset’s official evaluation metric. This metric computes the fraction of queries for which the minimal answer is contained in the top 𝑚 tokens of the retrieved passages. We consider 𝑚 = 2𝑘, 5𝑘 (R@2kt and R@5kt), as per common practice for this dataset. Statistical significant differences are reported with respect to a two-tailed t-test with Bonferroni correction. Baselines. Following common practice on XOR-TyDi [ 1], we adapt DPR [14] to the cross-lingual setting by initializing it with different multilingual pre-trained language models (PLMs). Specifi- cally, in our experiments we use the multilingual variants of BERT [6] (mBERT) and XLM-RoBERTa [ 5] (XLM-R) for this purpose. In addition to the standard supervised baselines, we also explore how our xQG embedding augmentation approach can improve a zero- shot xDR model, where the xDR is initialized with mBERT but it is trained with English only passage-query pairs and is directly applied to the XOR-TyDi cross-lingual retrieval task. Implementation details. We initialize our xQG model with the multilingual T5-base checkpoint provided by Google1 and available in the Huggingface library [38]. We fine-tune this checkpoint with the passage-query pairs in the XOR-TyDi training set. We train the xQG model for 1600 steps using a batch size of 128 and a learning rate of 1e-4. After training, we generate 5 queries per passage for each target language, resulting in about 7 * 5 * 18M =
