These models use a dual-encoder architecture that encodes both queries and passages with a PLM encoder into dense embeddings. They then perform approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) searching in the embedding space. Compared to traditional bag-of-words approaches, DRs benefit from semantic soft matching, which helps overcome the problem of word mismatch in passage retrieval [33, 45]. To leverage the semantic modelling power of DRs, recent research has extended English-only DRs to support cross-lingual settings
