value of𝛼 varies across different languages, and the improvements in effective- ness are not always statistically significant. We also observe that, for some languages, queries generated for other languages can improve the effectiveness of target queries in a different language. For instance, using queries generated for Japanese (Ja) can improve the effectiveness of target queries in Korean (ko), while using Russian (Ru) generated queries can help target queries in Telugu (Te). These results suggest that the embeddings of the queries generated for any single language potentially can also provide useful information for target queries in other languages. 6 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we propose a passage embedding augmentation ap- proach to enhance the effectiveness of cross-lingual DRs. Our method can be applied to any cross-lingual DR and it requires no further DR training nor changes to the retrieval pipeline. We empirically showed the method is effective for the cross-lingual DPR method across different backbones. However, a limitation of our empirical investigation is that we did not evaluate the method across other dense retriever architectures. We leave the extension of this Augmenting Passage Representations with Query Generation SIGIR ’23, July 23–27, 2023, Taipei, Taiwan investigation to future work. We also note that our approach relies on a xQG model that can generate high quality queries. However, a recent work has shown that T5-based query generation is prone to hallucination and that along with highly effective queries, the generator also produces poor queries that negatively impact re- trieval effectiveness [11]. They then propose the use of a cross- encoder ranker to filter out some ineffective generated queries; this practice can further improve effectiveness. We leave the adaptation of this approach in our xQG setting to future work. REFERENCES [1] Akari Asai, Jungo Kasai, Jonathan H. Clark, Kenton Lee, Eunsol
