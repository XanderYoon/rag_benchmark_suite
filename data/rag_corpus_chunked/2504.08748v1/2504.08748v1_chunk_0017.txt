integration of multimodal data enhances the accuracy of responses, particularly in instructional contexts such as "How to register for a Gmail account. ". By generating answers that interweave text and image, users can more effectively comprehend and follow the required operations. – Multimodal Data Enhances Richness: While multimodal data is not essential, its inclusion can significantly enhance user experience. For instance, when responding to a query such as "Please introduce the Eiffel Tower. ", supplementing the textual explanation with relevant images or a brief video can offer users a more engaging and visually enriched experience. 2.3.2 Modified Modules. • Documents Parsing and Indexing: To minimize information loss and enhance the accuracy of document retrieval, the document parsing and indexing module has been upgraded with innovative technologies. This new approach preserves document screenshots during parsing, addressing the information loss issues inherent in previous methods. By utilizing fine-tuned MLLMs, the system vectorizes and indexes these document screenshots, enabling efficient retrieval of relevant document screenshots based on user queries. This optimization not only improves the reliability of the knowledge base but also paves the way for advanced multimodal retrieval capabilities. • Generation: Previously, the generation module relied exclusively on large models with under- standing capabilities. The new paradigm integrates large models with generation capabilities, unifying reasoning and generation scenarios at the system architecture level. Additionally, by incorporating a multimodal output enhancement submodule, it facilitates a shift from text-based answers to mixed multimodal answers. The implementation methods can be categorized into two types: , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: April 2018. 10 Trovato et al. You can learn the route of Columbus's voyage through the video below. 1: Place the eggs and a small amount of salt into a container, and mix well. 2: Add warm water and continue to stir,
