. Publication date: April 2018. A Survey on Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation 13 information (e.g., text within images) and struggles with complex document formats. Additionally, the parsed results often suffer from significant loss of document structure information. To enhance document parsing accuracy and address the limitations of rule-based methods in handling complex real-world documents, such as in Visual Document Understanding (VDU) tasks, OCR (Optical Character Recognition)-based approaches have become widely adopted. The traditional OCR-based document parsing pipeline consists of three main stages: text detection, text recognition, and text parsing. Text Detection involves locating and extracting text regions from documents. Early methods primarily relied on Connected Component Analysis (CCA) [26, 363] and Edge Detection algorithms [261]. For more complex layouts, techniques such as Contour Analysis and Stroke Width Transform (SWT) [73, 344] were employed to handle multi-oriented text. With advancements in machine learning, hybrid models combining regression-based object detection frameworks (e.g., Faster R-CNN) with semantic segmentation networks were developed to address arbitrary-shaped text instances [15, 206, 481]. This stage outputs precise bounding boxes or polygon coordinates around text elements, serving as the basis for subsequent processing. Text Recognition converts visual text representations into machine-readable text, playing a critical role in digitizing unstructured data. Its evolution can be divided into three phases: The classical phase relied on handcrafted features [ 290] and statistical models [ 22], but faced challenges with fragmented processing and limited robustness. The deep learning phase introduced CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) for feature extraction and CTC (Connectionist Temporal Classification)/RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks) for sequence modeling, with breakthroughs like CRNN enabling unified pipelines and improved accuracy on irregular text. The modern phase leverages transformer architectures [191], achieving global context awareness and robustness to arbitrary-shaped text. Text Parsing reconstructs semantic relationships through three key steps: Layout Analysis segments documents into logical components
