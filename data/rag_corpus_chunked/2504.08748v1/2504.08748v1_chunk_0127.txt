April 2018. A Survey on Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation 55 factual retrievals to complex multi-hop reasoning and creative tasks. The datasets must reflect real-world heterogeneity in query patterns and modalities, capturing the intricacies of user interactions across text, image, audio, and video inputs. By integrating such diversity, benchmarks can more accurately assess model performance, generalization capabilities, and adaptability to varied real-world applications. – Multi-Dimensional Metrics: To ensure the effectiveness and reliability of Multimodal Search Planning systems, robust evaluation frameworks must be established. These frameworks should employ multi-dimensional metrics to comprehensively assess system performance across diverse operational scenarios. Key dimensions include: 1) Adaptability: The system’s ability to handle a broad spectrum of query types, from simple to highly complex, while integrating multiple modalities (e.g., text, images, audio). This metric evaluates the model’s flexibility in addressing varied user needs and its capacity to generalize across domains. 2) Robustness: The system’s resilience under challenging conditions, such as computational con- straints, noisy or incomplete inputs, and adversarial scenarios. Robustness ensures consistent performance in real-world applications, where ideal conditions are seldom present. 3) Effi- ciency: The optimization of resource utilization (e.g., memory, processing power) and response time. This metric is critical for scalability and user satisfaction, especially in time-sensitive or resource-constrained environments. 4) Semantic Alignment: The system’s accuracy in preserving and interpreting the intent of user queries during reformulation or multimodal integration. This ensures that outputs remain contextually and semantically aligned with the user’s original request. 7.3 Retrieval The challenges in multimodal retrieval underscore the complexity of integrating and retrieving information across diverse data types. To address these issues and advance the field, future research should prioritize the following directions: • Unified Cross-Modal Representation Learning: The primary objective is to develop robust and unified representation learning frameworks that effectively align and compare data across diverse modalities,
