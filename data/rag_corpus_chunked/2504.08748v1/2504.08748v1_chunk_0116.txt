Positioning and Integration of Multimodal Elements : In multimodal outputs, such as text with embedded images or videos, the model must intelligently determine where to integrate non-textual elements. This requires an understanding of the narrative flow and the identification of optimal insertion points to enhance coherence and readability. Additionally, the model should dynamically generate or retrieve relevant multimodal content based on context. For instance, when creating a text-image pair, the model may need to generate an image caption, search for relevant images, and select the most appropriate one. This process must be efficient and seamless to ensure the final output is both relevant and high-quality. – Diversity of Outputs: In some applications, generating diverse outputs—such as multiple images or videos corresponding to a given text description—is essential. However, balancing diversity with relevance and quality poses a significant challenge. The model must explore a broad range of possibilities while ensuring each output remains contextually appropriate and adheres to high-quality standards. 6.5 Dataset & Evaluation The advancement of MLLMs has heightened the need for comprehensive evaluation. Despite the introduction of over a hundred benchmarks by both academic and industrial communities, several challenges remain in the current evaluation landscape. First, there is a lack of a universally accepted, standardized capability taxonomy, with existing benchmarks often defining their own disparate ability dimensions. Second, current benchmarks exhibit significant gaps in critical areas such as instruction following, complex multimodal reasoning, multi-turn dialogue, and creativity assessment. Third, task-specific evaluations for MLLMs are insufficient, particularly in commercially relevant domains like invoice recognition, multimodal knowledge base comprehension, and UI understanding and industry. Finally, while existing multimodal benchmarks primarily focus on image and video modalities, there is a notable deficit in assessing capabilities related to audio and 3D representations. Addressing these challenges is essential for developing more robust and comprehensive
