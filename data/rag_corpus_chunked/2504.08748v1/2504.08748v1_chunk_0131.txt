evaluate the model’s ability to comprehend and execute complex, multi-step instructions across diverse modalities. This includes assessing precision in adhering to nuanced directives and handling ambiguous or incomplete inputs. 2) Multiturn Dialogue: Develop datasets that simulate real-world conversational dynamics, emphasizing the model’s capacity for context retention, coherence, and adaptability over extended interactions. Scenarios should include cross-modal references and long-term memory challenges. 3) Complex Multimodal Reasoning: Design tasks requiring the integration of multiple modalities , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: April 2018. A Survey on Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation 57 (e.g., text, images, audio) to solve real-world problems, such as interpreting charts, maps, or combining visual and textual data for decision-making. 4) Creativity Evaluation: Introduce benchmarks to assess generative capabilities in creative tasks, such as composing stories, poems, or designing visual artifacts from multimodal inputs. These tasks should measure originality, relevance, and the ability to synthesize diverse inputs into coherent outputs. 5) Diverse Modalities: Expand evaluation frameworks to include emerging modalities like audio, 3D models, and sensor data, ensuring robustness and versatility in handling a wide range of input types. • Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation: The development of robust metrics for eval- uating retrieval and generation in multimodal systems requires assessing relevance, precision, diversity, and cross-modal alignment to ensure semantic consistency and contextual appropri- ateness. Metrics should quantify the system’s ability to filter noise and redundancy, delivering concise and meaningful outputs. For generation quality, coherence, fluency, creativity, and adapt- ability are essential, alongside factual accuracy and consistency with retrieved data and external knowledge. Effective multimodal integration is crucial to unify diverse inputs into contextually rich outputs. Comprehensive benchmarks must simulate real-world scenarios, incorporating varied queries, multimodal sources, and differing complexity levels to evaluate the end-to-end performance of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines. 8 Conclusion In conclusion, this survey comprehensively examines the
