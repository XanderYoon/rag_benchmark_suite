Finally, we give the conclusion of the paper in section 8. 2 Overview of MRAG Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) represents a significant evolution of the traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, building upon its foundational structure while extending its capabilities to process diverse data modalities. While RAG is limited to processing plain text, MRAG integrates multimodal data, including images, audio, video, and text, enabling it to address more complex and diverse real-world applications where information spans multiple modalities. In the early stages of MRAG development, researchers converted multimodal data into unified textual representations. This approach allowed for a seamless transition from RAG to MRAG by leveraging existing text-based retrieval and generation mechanisms. Although this strategy simplified multimodal data integration and improved the end-to-end user experience, it introduced significant limitations. For instance, the conversion process often resulted in the loss of modality- specific information, such as visual details in images or tonal nuances in audio, restricting the system’s ability to fully exploit the potential of multimodal inputs. Subsequent research has focused on addressing these limitations by developing
