MLLMs process raw multimodal inputs (e.g., images, audio, video) to extract meaningful representations, while LLMs generate coherent and contextually accurate textual outputs. This division of labor optimizes perfor- mance, as MLLMs excel in multimodal feature extraction and LLMs in linguistic precision. For example, in document parsing, MLLMs analyze visual layouts, tables, or embedded graphics, while LLMs synthesize this information into structured textual formats. 7.2 Multimodal Search Planning The future of multimodal search planning should focus on addressing three key challenges within the hierarchical framework: intelligent adaptive planning mechanisms, query reformulation and semantic alignment, and comprehensive evaluation benchmarks. Below are targeted suggestions for advancing each area. • Intelligent Adaptive Planning Mechanisms: – Multi-Agent Collaborative Systems: To address the challenges of multimodal search and complex query resolution, multi-agent collaborative systems can be designed to leverage specialized agents working in tandem. These systems enhance efficiency, adaptability, and robustness in handling multi-hop, creative, or cross-modal queries. Key mechanisms include: 1) Parallel Reasoning Paths: Specialized agents can simultaneously explore multiple reasoning trajectories, enabling faster and more comprehensive solutions. This approach is particularly effective for multi-hop queries, where intermediate reasoning steps are critical, or for creative tasks requiring diverse perspectives. By evaluating multiple pathways in parallel, the system can identify optimal solutions while mitigating the risk of local optima. 2) Complementary Re- trieval Strategies: Agents can employ diverse retrieval methodologies, such as keyword-based, semantic, or cross-modal retrieval, to address different aspects of a query. For instance, one agent might focus on extracting structured data, while another leverages semantic embeddings or visual-textual alignment for multimodal contexts. The synthesis of these strategies ensures robust and contextually relevant search outcomes, enhancing the system’s ability to handle heterogeneous data sources. 3) Dynamic Resource Allocation: Agents can monitor computa- tional resources and system constraints in real-time, dynamically adjusting retrieval strategies to
