is particularly problematic in long documents with associated segments. Preserving these relationships is essential for ensuring contextually accurate outputs. • Balancing Multimodal and Textual Data: The document parsing module has grown increas- ingly complex as modern MRAG systems must handle multimodal data, including images, tables, and text. To address this, contemporary approaches preserve the original multimodal inputs to minimize information loss, while also converting them into textual captions or descriptions. Although retaining the original data reduces information loss, relying solely on it has proven suboptimal. Recent studies highlight the benefits of leveraging textual representations derived from multimodal data. For example, Riedler and Langer [312] showed that models generate higher-quality responses using textual captions from images rather than processing raw images directly. Similarly, Ma et al. [259] found that LLMs outperform MLLMs in text generation tasks, revealing a performance gap between multimodal and text-focused systems. This gap highlights , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article .

These enhancements, while improving functionality, increase system complexity and expand the volume of data requiring processing, storage, and management. 6.2 Multimodal Search Planning The challenges in multimodal search planning can be more effectively understood through a hierarchical framework similar to leveled RAG systems, where queries span a spectrum from simple factual retrievals to complex, creative tasks. This framework highlights three critical challenges that must be addressed to advance the field. • Intelligent Adaptive Planning Mechanisms: The primary challenge is developing intelligent adaptive planning mechanisms that can dynamically adjust to the diversity and complexity of queries. Current systems often rely on predetermined pipelines, which fail to accommodate variations in query characteristics or computational constraints, leading to inefficient resource allocation
