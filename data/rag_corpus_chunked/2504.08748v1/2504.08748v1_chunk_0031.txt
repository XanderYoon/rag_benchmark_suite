systems. Unlike single- modality approaches, these methods integrate both textual and visual knowledge sources, albeit through fixed processing pipelines. For instance, MMSearch [147] employs a rigid multimodal planning pipeline, mandating Google Lens image searches for all image-containing queries. This is followed by a "Requery" phase, where LLMs reformulate the search query using the original query, image, and Google Lens results. While this structured approach ensures systematic information retrieval, its inflexible design often leads to unnecessary image searches, increasing computational overhead when visual information is irrelevant to the query. Fixed pipeline approaches, whether single-modality or multimodality, exhibit several critical limi- tations. First, their rigid retrieval strategies struggle to adapt to the diverse nature of real-world queries, where the optimal retrieval modality depends on specific information needs. Second, mandatory retrieval operations often introduce redundant or irrelevant information, particularly when certain knowledge types are unnecessary for addressing the query. Third, these approaches incur significant computational overhead, especially in multimodal pipelines handling large-scale knowledge bases. As highlighted by mR2AG [474], a more fundamental issue is that not all queries require external knowledge retrieval. Current MRAG systems frequently perform retrieval indiscrim- inately, resulting in unnecessary computational costs and potential noise in response generation. These limitations emphasize the need to transition from predetermined pipelines to adaptive plan- ning mechanisms that dynamically adjust retrieval strategies based on query characteristics and intermediate results. 3.2.2 Adaptive Planning. Recent studies have highlighted two key limitations in fixed pipeline approaches [197]: 1) Non-adaptive Retrieval Queries: inflexible retrieval strategies that fail to adjust to evolving contexts or intermediate results; and 2) Overloaded Retrieval Queries: concatenating , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article .
