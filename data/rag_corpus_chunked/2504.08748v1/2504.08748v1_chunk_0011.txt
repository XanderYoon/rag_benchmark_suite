information loss. These issues collectively created a bottleneck, limiting the system’s ability to retrieve comprehensive and accurate information. • Challenges in Generation: Unlike traditional RAG, MRAG1.0 required processing not only text chunks but also image captions and other multimodal data. Effectively organizing these diverse elements into coherent prompts while minimizing redundancy and preserving relevant information posed a significant challenge. Additionally, the "Garbage In, Garbage Out" (GIGO) , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: April 2018. 6 Trovato et al.

The architecture of MRAG2.0 retains multimodal data through document parsing and indexing, while introducing multimodal retrieval and MLLMs for answer generation, truly entering the multimodal era. principle highlighted the sensitivity of LLMs to input quality. Information loss during parsing and retrieval increased the risk of incorporating irrelevant data, compromising the robustness and reliability of the generated responses. The limitations of MRAG1.0 created a performance ceiling, highlighting the need for more advanced technological solutions. The system’s reliance on text-based representations for multimodal data, along with inherent challenges in retrieval and generation, revealed critical gaps in multimodal understanding, retrieval efficiency, and generation robustness. Subsequent iterations of MRAG must address these issues by adopting more sophisticated models, enhancing information retention during parsing, and improving the integration of multimodal data into retrieval and generation processes. 2.2 MRAG2.0 With the rapid evolution of
