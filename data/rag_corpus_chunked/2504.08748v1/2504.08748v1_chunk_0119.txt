multimodal AI assessment. 7 Future Directions In this chapter, we propose several suggestions to the future development of multimodal Retrieval- Augmented Generation (MRAG) systems, informed by related research and identified challenges. These recommendations collectively aim to overcome existing limitations and unlock the full potential of MRAG in complex, real-world scenarios. 7.1 Documents Parsing Multimodal document parsing has become a crucial element in MRAG systems, particularly with the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large models (MLLMs). The fusion of text, images, and other data types into a cohesive framework presents both transformative opportunities and notable challenges. This paper provides a detailed analysis of future directions in this evolving field. • Enhancing Data Accuracy and Completeness: – Contextual Relationship Preservation: To improve the accuracy and coherence of multi- modal document parsing, especially for long and complex documents, advanced algorithms are needed to capture and preserve both inter-page and intra-document relationships. Techniques such as graph-based representations and hierarchical document modeling can help maintain contextual coherence across the document. These methods enable the system to understand structural and semantic dependencies between sections, tables, figures, and other elements, ensuring the preservation of the document’s logical flow. Additionally, cross-referencing mech- anisms are essential for linking related content across pages. These mechanisms dynamically connect sections, tables, and figures, facilitating seamless retrieval and utilization of contextual relationships in downstream tasks like information extraction, summarization, or question answering. By integrating these approaches, the system can better handle the complexities of long documents, ensuring accurate maintenance and leveraging of contextual relationships for enhanced performance in multimodal document understanding tasks. This is particularly relevant when combining Optical Character Recognition (OCR), LLMs, and MLLMs to process and interpret documents with diverse content types. , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article .
