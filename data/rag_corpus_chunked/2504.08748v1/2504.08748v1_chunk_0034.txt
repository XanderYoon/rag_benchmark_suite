456], web search [ 92, 269, 270], and retrieval-augmented generation systems [33, 45, 102, 330]. Recent advancements categorize text retrieval methods into two types: sparse retrieval and dense retrieval. · Sparse Text Retrieval.Early research in text retrieval focused on extracting representative terms from documents, leading to the development of vector space models [320] based on the "bag-of-words" assumption, which represents documents and queries as sparse term vectors, ignoring term order. Term weighting methods like tf-idf [9, 314, 319] and BM25 models [315, 316] were introduced to assign weights based on term importance within and across corpora, while inverted indexes [ 513] improved retrieval efficiency by organizing corpora into term-document ID pairs.
