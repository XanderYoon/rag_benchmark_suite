dual retrieval approach enriches data sources for downstream tasks while minimizing data loss, improving accuracy and robustness for downstream tasks. • Multimodal Generation: To fully leverage original multimodal data, the generation module in MRAG2.0 has been enhanced by integrating MLLMs, enabling the synthesis of user queries and retrieval results into a coherent prompt. When retrieval results are accurate and the input comprises original multimodal data, the generation module mitigates information loss typically associated with modality conversion. This enhancement has significantly improved the accuracy of question-answering (QA) tasks, especially in scenarios involving interrelated multimodal data. Despite these advancements, MRAG2.0 encounters several emerging challenges: 1) Integrating multimodal data inputs may reduce the accuracy of traditional textual query descriptions. Further- more, current multimodal retrieval capabilities remain inferior to text-based retrieval, potentially limiting the overall accuracy of the retrieval module. 2) The diversity of data formats presents new challenges for the generation module. Efficiently organizing these diverse data forms and clearly defining inputs for generation are critical areas requiring further exploration and prioritization. 2.3 MRAG3.0 As illustrated in Figure 3, the MRAG3.0 system represents a significant evolution from its predeces- sors, introducing structural and functional innovations that enhance its capabilities across multiple dimensions. This new paradigm shift is characterized by three key advancements: 1) Enhanced Document Parsing: A novel approach retains document page screenshots during parsing, minimiz- ing information loss in database storage. 2) True End-to-End Multimodality: While earlier versions emphasized multimodal capabilities in knowledge base construction and system input, MRAG3.0 introduces multimodal output capabilities, completing the end-to-end multimodal framework. 3) Scenario Expansion: Moving beyond traditional focus on understanding capabilities—primarily ap- plied in VQA (Visual Question Answering) scenarios reliant on knowledge bases, the new paradigm integrates understanding and generation capabilities through module adjustments and additions. This unification significantly broadens the system’s applicability. In the
