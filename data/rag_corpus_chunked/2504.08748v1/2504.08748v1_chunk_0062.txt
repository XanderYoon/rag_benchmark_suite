TCRA-LLM [220] combines summarization and semantic compression to reduce token size. TACO-RL [323] employs reinforcement learning for task-aware prompt compression, ensuring low latency. FaviComp [ 158] enhances evidence familiarity by combining token probabilities from compression and target models, reducing perplexity. – Refining for Cross-Model: Recent advancements in visual token compression for MLLMs focus on enhancing efficiency without significant performance loss. LLaVolta [34] introduces a method to reduce the number of visual tokens, enhancing training and inference efficiency without compromising performance. To minimize information loss during compression while maintaining training efficiency, it employs a lightweight, staged training scheme. This scheme , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: April 2018. A Survey on Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation 29 progressively compresses visual tokens from heavy to light compression during training, en- suring no information loss during testing. PyramidDrop [407] is a visual redundancy reduction strategy for MLLMs, designed to improve efficiency in both inference and training with negli- gible performance loss. It partitions the MLLM into several stages and drops a predefined ratio of image tokens at the end of each stage. DeCo [425] proposes the principle of "Decouple Com- pression from Abstraction, " which involves compressing visual tokens at the patch level using projectors while allowing the LLM to handle visual semantic abstraction entirely. MustDrop [226] measures the importance of each token throughout its lifecycle, including the vision encoding, prefilling, and decoding stages. During vision encoding, it merges spatially adjacent tokens with high similarity and establishes a key token set to retain vision-critical tokens. In the prefilling stage, it further compresses vision tokens guided by text semantics using a dual-attention filtering strategy. In the decoding stage, an output-aware cache policy reduces the size of the KV cache. By employing tailored strategies across these stages, MustDrop achieves an optimal balance between performance
