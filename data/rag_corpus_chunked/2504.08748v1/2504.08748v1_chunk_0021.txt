is formulated as: 𝑎∗ = 𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑎∈ A F𝑅𝐶 (𝑎 | Q , D) (1) where the retrieval control module F𝑅𝐶 evaluates the utility of retrieval actions by considering query characteristics, the MLLM’s inherent capabilities, and, when available, the retrieved documents D from previous iterations. For example, in multi-hop scenarios, after retrieving visual information in the initial round, the module may leverage accumulated knowledge to determine subsequent actions, such as text-based retrieval or direct generation. Existing MRAG frameworks typically follow a rigid pipeline with predetermined retrieval actions, which poses significant limitations. Recent studies [125] have shown that compulsive image-to-image retrieval can be counterproductive, as retrieved images may introduce misleading information, degrading MLLM performance. This highlights the necessity of dynamic retrieval strategy selection. – Query Reformulation: In scenarios where external information is required ( 𝑎∗ ≠ 𝑎𝑛𝑜𝑛𝑒) for queries, the task of query reformulation involves generating an enhanced query Q∗ by integrating visual information and, when applicable, retrieved documents from previous iterations. This process can be formulated as: Q∗ = F𝑄𝑅 (Q, D) (2) where F𝑄𝑅 denotes the query enhancement function, which utilizes visual cues and, if available, historical retrieval results to refine the query’s precision. This task is particularly critical in real- world human interactions, where queries often rely heavily on visual context and frequently employ anaphoric references. The inherent challenges of visual incompleteness and textual ambiguity pose significant obstacles to retrieving relevant information through straightforward search mechanisms. For complex queries that necessitate multi-hop reasoning, the enhanced query Q∗ may be further decomposed into a series of atomic sub-queries {𝑞∗ 1, ..., 𝑞∗ 𝑛 }. Each sub-query is meticulously formulated by considering both textual and visual contexts, as well as the accumulated knowledge from previous iterations, when relevant. This decomposition allows for a more granular and precise retrieval process, addressing
