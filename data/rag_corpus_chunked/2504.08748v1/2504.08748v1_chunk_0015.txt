MRAG3.0 architecture integrates document screenshots during the document parsing and indexing stages to minimize information loss. At the input stage, it incorporates a Multimodal Search Planning module, unifying Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) tasks while refining user query precision. At the output stage, the Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Composition module enhances answer generation by transforming plain text into multimodal formats, thereby enriching information delivery. enhanced by Retrieval-Augmentation (RA), which significantly improves the overall performance of generation tasks (see Figure 4). • Fusion Multimodal Output Scenario: This scenario is distinct from those previously men- tioned but represents a significant aspect of the new paradigm, warranting separate discussion. In traditional settings, the final output is typically a plain text response. However, the new paradigm enhances the generation module to produce outputs that integrate multiple modalities within a , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: April 2018.
