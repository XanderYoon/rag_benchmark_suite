logical inconsistencies, or nuanced contextual mismatches. Consequently, coarse- grained evaluation is best used as an initial screening tool or in scenarios where high-level semantic fidelity is prioritized over detailed precision. For more rigorous evaluation, it is often supplemented by fine-grained metrics that address specific aspects of content quality. In summary, coarse-grained evaluation offers a pragmatic balance between efficiency and effectiveness, particularly in applications requiring quick assessments or large-scale model comparisons. – Fine-Grained Evaluation: Fine-grained evaluation, such as RAGChecker [317] and RAGAS [74], offers a nuanced and detailed approach to assessing MRAG systems, surpassing the limita- tions of coarse-grained methods. This approach involves decomposing both model-generated , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: April 2018. A Survey on Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation 47 responses and reference answers into granular knowledge points or semantic units, which are individually evaluated based on criteria such as accuracy, relevance, and alignment with the reference. By analyzing responses at this level of detail, the method enables precise identifica- tion of a model’s strengths and weaknesses, particularly in capturing and reproducing intricate information. The fine-grained approach is especially valuable for diagnosing performance issues in handling complex or nuanced content. However, it is computationally intensive, requiring robust mechanisms for extracting, matching, and evaluating multiple semantic units. Careful design of these mechanisms is essential to ensure evaluation consistency and reliability. Despite its challenges, this method provides a rigorous and comprehensive framework for advancing the development and refinement of MRAG systems, making it a critical tool in the field. The choice between coarse-grained and fine-grained evaluation depends on the assessment objectives. Coarse-grained methods are ideal for obtaining quick, high-level insights, whereas fine-grained approaches are better suited for detailed analysis and iterative model refinement. Integrating both strategies can provide a balanced perspective, combining the efficiency of coarse-grained evaluation with the
