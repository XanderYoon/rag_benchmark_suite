representations for multimodal data, along with inherent challenges in retrieval and generation, revealed critical gaps in multimodal understanding, retrieval efficiency, and generation robustness. Subsequent iterations of MRAG must address these issues by adopting more sophisticated models, enhancing information retention during parsing, and improving the integration of multimodal data into retrieval and generation processes. 2.2 MRAG2.0 With the rapid evolution of multimodal technologies, MRAG has transitioned into a "true mul- timodal" era, termed MRAG2.0. Unlike its predecessor MRAG1.0, MRAG2.0 not only supports user queries with multimodal inputs but also preserves the original multimodal data within the knowledge base. By leveraging the capabilities of MLLMs, the generation module can now process multimodal data directly, minimizing information loss during data conversion. As illustrated in Figure 2, the MRAG2.0 architecture incorporates several key optimizations: • MLLMs Captions: The representational capabilities of MLLMs have significantly advanced, es- pecially in captioning tasks. MRAG2.0 leverages a single, unified MLLM—or multiple MLLMs—to extract captions from multimodal documents. This approach replaces the conventional paradigm of using separate models for different modalities, simplifying the document parsing module and reducing its complexity. , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article .

A Survey on Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation 7 • Multimodal Retrieval: MRAG2.0 enhances its retrieval module to support multimodal user inputs by preserving original multimodal data and enabling cross-modal retrieval. This allows text- based queries to directly retrieve relevant multimodal data, combining caption-based recall with cross-modal search capabilities. The dual retrieval approach enriches data sources for downstream tasks while minimizing data loss, improving accuracy and robustness for downstream tasks. • Multimodal Generation: To fully leverage original multimodal data, the generation module in MRAG2.0 has been enhanced by integrating MLLMs, enabling the synthesis of user queries and retrieval results into a coherent prompt. When retrieval results are accurate and the
