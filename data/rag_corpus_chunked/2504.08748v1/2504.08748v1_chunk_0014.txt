knowledge base construction and system input, MRAG3.0 introduces multimodal output capabilities, completing the end-to-end multimodal framework. 3) Scenario Expansion: Moving beyond traditional focus on understanding capabilities—primarily ap- plied in VQA (Visual Question Answering) scenarios reliant on knowledge bases, the new paradigm integrates understanding and generation capabilities through module adjustments and additions. This unification significantly broadens the system’s applicability. In the following sections, we will detail the scenarios supported by MRAG3.0 and the specific module modifications enabling these advanced capabilities. 2.3.1 Scenario for MRAG. • Retrieval-Augmented Scenario: This scenario addresses cases where LLMs or MLLMs alone cannot adequately answer user queries. MRAG3.0 retrieves relevant content from external knowledge bases to provide accurate answers, leveraging its enhanced retrieval capabilities. • VQA Scenario: This scenario serves as a critical test for evaluating the fundamental capabilities of MLLMs, which generate responses directly from user inputs containing text and multimodal queries without retrieval. The new MRAG paradigm introduces a search planning module, enabling dynamic routing and retrieval to minimize unnecessary searches and the inclusion of irrelevant information. • Multimodal Generation Scenario: This primarily pertains to multimodal generation tasks, such as text-to-image or text-to-video generation. While the original MRAG framework primarily addressed understanding tasks, the new MRAG paradigm extends its capabilities by modifying multiple generation modules, unifying the solutions for both understanding and generation tasks within a single framework. Following integration, the generation scenarios are further , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: April 2018. 8 Trovato et al.
