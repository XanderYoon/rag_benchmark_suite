are essential, alongside factual accuracy and consistency with retrieved data and external knowledge. Effective multimodal integration is crucial to unify diverse inputs into contextually rich outputs. Comprehensive benchmarks must simulate real-world scenarios, incorporating varied queries, multimodal sources, and differing complexity levels to evaluate the end-to-end performance of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines. 8 Conclusion In conclusion, this survey comprehensively examines the emerging field of Multimodal Retrieval- Augmented Generation (MRAG), highlighting its potential to enhance the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by integrating multimodal data such as text, images, and videos. Unlike traditional text-based RAG systems, MRAG addresses the challenges of retrieving and generat- ing information across different modalities, thereby improving the accuracy and relevance of responses while reducing hallucinations. The survey systematically analyzes MRAG from four key perspectives: essential components and technologies, datasets, evaluation methods and metrics, and existing limitations. It identifies current challenges, such as effectively integrating multimodal knowledge and ensuring the reliability of generated outputs, while also proposing future research directions. By providing a structured overview and forward-looking insights, this survey aims to guide researchers in advancing MRAG, ultimately contributing to the development of more robust and versatile Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation.
