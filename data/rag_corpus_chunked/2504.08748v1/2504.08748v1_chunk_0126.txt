– Interactive Query Refinement: A pivotal strategy is interactive query refinement, which allows users to iteratively adjust queries based on intermediate results. Intelligent systems can facilitate this process by suggesting alternative query formulations, identifying ambiguities, and providing contextual feedback to better align queries with user intent. By integrating user feedback loops and real-time semantic analysis, these systems dynamically bridge the gap between user input and multimodal data, ensuring more precise and contextually relevant search outcomes. – Explainable Reformulation: A critical aspect of query reformulation is its explainability. By offering clear and concise explanations for how queries are transformed, users gain insight into the system’s reasoning and decision-making processes. For example, when a user submits a vague or ambiguous query, the system can generate a reformulated version while detailing the rationale behind the changes, such as term disambiguation, incorporation of contextual cues, or alignment with multimodal data (e.g., text, images, or audio). This transparency fosters user trust, enables validation of the system’s interpretation, and enhances user control and satisfaction. Furthermore, explainable reformulation underscores the importance of semantic alignment, where the system bridges the gap between user intent and the underlying data representation, ensuring the reformulated query accurately reflects the user’s needs. • Comprehensive Evaluation Benchmarks: – Diverse Query Datasets: It is crucial to establish robust benchmarks. These benchmarks should incorporate diverse query datasets spanning a wide range of query types, from simple , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: April 2018. A Survey on Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation 55 factual retrievals to complex multi-hop reasoning and creative tasks. The datasets must reflect real-world heterogeneity in query patterns and modalities, capturing the intricacies of user interactions across text, image, audio, and video inputs. By integrating such diversity, benchmarks can more accurately assess model performance, generalization capabilities, and adaptability to varied real-world
