their infancy. In the realm of complex multimodal reasoning, current evaluations predominantly focus on mathematical and examination problems, necessitating , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: April 2018. A Survey on Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation 51 improvements in both difficulty and relevance to everyday use cases. Notably, the evaluation of multimodal creative tasks, a key application area for these models—such as text generation based on image and textual prompts—remains largely unexplored, highlighting a critical gap in the current evaluation landscape. MLLMs are still in the early stages of development, with limited business applications to date. As a result, current evaluations primarily focus on assessing foundational capabilities rather than real-world performance. Moving forward, it is critical to develop evaluation frameworks that measure MLLM performance on specific tasks with commercial value, such as large-scale document processing, multimodal knowledge base comprehension, anomaly detection, and industrial visual inspection. When designing task-specific evaluations, it is essential to consider not only performance metrics but also computational costs and inference speeds, benchmarking them against traditional computer vision methods like OCR, object detection, and action recognition to determine practical applicability. Additionally, a key potential of MLLMs lies in their ability to plan and interact with environments as agents to solve complex problems. Developing diverse virtual environments for MLLMs to demonstrate agent-based problem-solving capabilities will likely become a critical component of future evaluations. Current efforts in this domain remain nascent, highlighting a promising area for future research in multimodal AI assessment. 7 Future Directions In this chapter, we propose several suggestions to the future development of multimodal Retrieval- Augmented Generation (MRAG) systems, informed by related research and identified challenges. These recommendations collectively aim to overcome existing limitations and unlock the full potential of MRAG in complex, real-world scenarios. 7.1 Documents Parsing Multimodal document parsing has become a crucial
