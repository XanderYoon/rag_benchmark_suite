the capabilities of MLLMs, a diverse range of evalua- tion benchmarks has been developed. These benchmarks are designed to test various dimensions of model performance. By utilizing these benchmarks, researchers can systematically quantify the strengths and limitations of MLLMs, ensuring their alignment with real-world applications and user expectations. This evaluation framework not only supports the iterative improvement of MLLMs but also provides a standardized basis for comparing models in terms of perceptual and reasoning abilities. VQA v2 [ 104], an early benchmark with 453K annotated QA pairs, focuses on open-ended questions with concise answers. VizWiz [ 112], introduced around the same time, includes 8K QA pairs from visually impaired individuals’ daily lives, addressing real-world needs of disabled users. NLVR2 [336] explores multi-image vision capabilities by evaluating captions against image pairs. However, these benchmarks often fail to assess modern MLLMs’ emergent capabilities, such as advanced reasoning. Recent efforts like LVLM-eHub [ 411], MDVP [ 212], and LAMM [ 430] compile extensive datasets for comprehensive evaluation, revealing that while MLLMs excel in commonsense tasks, they lag in image classification, OCR, VQA, large-scale counting, fine-grained attribute differentiation, and precise object localization. Fine-tuning can mitigate some of these limitations. Researchers are developing specialized benchmarks to address the limitations of traditional evaluations for MLLMs. Notable examples include MME [ 29], which covers 14 perception and , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article .
