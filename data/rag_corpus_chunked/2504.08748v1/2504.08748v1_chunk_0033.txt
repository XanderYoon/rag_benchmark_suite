of documents to support high-quality LLM responses. Its performance is crucial, as it directly influences the quality of the downstream retrieval pipeline. As shown in Figure 7, existing retrieval methods fall into two categories based on architecture: Single/Dual-stream Structure and Generative Structure, each involves single-modal (e.g., text, images) and cross-modal information retrieval. • Single/Dual-stream Structure: The Single-stream Structure integrates multimodal fusion modules to model image-text relationships in a unified semantic space, capturing fine-grained interactions but incurring higher computational costs and slower inference, limiting scalability for large-scale multimodal retrieval tasks in real-world applications. In contrast, the Dual-stream Structure uses separate vision and language streams, leveraging contrastive learning to align global features in a shared semantic space efficiently. However, it lacks explicit multimodal interaction and struggles with feature alignment due to information imbalance, exacerbated by the brevity of dataset captions. – Retrieval for Single-Modal. In MRAG systems, single-modal retrieval focuses on text and image retrieval. Text retrieval uses NLP techniques to extract relevant information from datasets, identifying contextually aligned documents. Image retrieval employs computer vision algorithms and feature extraction methods to encode visual data into high-dimensional vectors for similarity matching. Both modalities are essential for enhancing MRAG system performance. ∗ Text-centric. Text retrieval, a core component of information retrieval (IR), identifies relevant textual information from large corpora or web resources in response to user queries. It is widely used in downstream applications such as question answering [161, 304], dialogue systems [334, 436, 456], web search [ 92, 269, 270], and retrieval-augmented generation systems [33, 45, 102, 330]. Recent advancements categorize text retrieval methods into two types: sparse retrieval and dense retrieval. · Sparse Text Retrieval.Early research in text retrieval focused on extracting representative terms from documents, leading to the development of vector space models [320] based on the "bag-of-words" assumption, which represents
