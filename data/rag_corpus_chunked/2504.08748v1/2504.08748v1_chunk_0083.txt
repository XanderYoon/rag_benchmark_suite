to enhance MLLMs’ focus on specific image regions. To further upgrading vision capabilities on multiple image understanding, Mementos [381] evaluates sequential image understanding, while MIRB [482] focuses on multi-image reasoning across perception, visual knowledge, and multi-hop reasoning tasks. ReMI [162] designs 13 tasks with diverse image relationships and input formats, and MuirBench [368] includes 12 multi-image understanding tasks with unanswerable variants for robust assessment. VEGA [ 493] is specifi- cally designed to evaluate interleaved image-text comprehension. The task requires models to identify relevant images and text while filtering out irrelevant information to arrive at the correct answer. Evaluation results reveal that even advanced proprietary MLLMs, such as GPT-4V and Gemini 1.5 Pro, achieve only modest performance, highlighting significant room for improvement in interleaved information processing capabilities. 4.2.2 Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Multimodal benchmarks are increasingly focusing on the evaluation of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tasks, driving progress in document understanding. Early benchmarks like TextVQA [327] and OCR-VQA [275] evaluated standard text recognition, while WebSRC [ 41] introduces advanced structural reasoning tasks like web page layout interpretation. SEED-Bench-2-Plus [178] and OCRBench [233] expanded evaluation to diverse data types, including charts, maps, and web pages, showing models achieving near state-of- the-art performance in recognizing various OCR text. VCR [473] addresses OCR task with partially obscured text embedded in images, requiring content reconstruction. Despite advancements, many MLLMs struggle with fine-grained OCR tasks. While models like GPT-4V perform well, they lag behind specialized OCR models. Performance varies significantly by data type, with knowledge graphs and maps posing greater challenges than simpler formats like charts, suggesting potential improvements through data-specific optimization or dedicated OCR integration. 4.2.3 Structural Document. Structural documents, including charts, HTML web content, and vari- ous document formats, play a critical role in practical applications due to their ability to efficiently convey complex
