to assess the models’ cognitive and perceptual abilities. SciGraphQA [192] 2023 generate 295K samples of open-vocabulary multi-turn question-answering dialogues about the graphs. As context, it provided the text-only Palm-2 with paper title, abstract, paragraph mentioning the graph, and rich text contextual data from the graph itself, obtaining dialogues with an average 2.23 question-answer turns for each graph. MMC-Benchmark [217] 2023 consists of 2k QA pairs with 1,063 unique images, accompanied by 1,275 multiple-choice questions and 851 free-form questions. The average length of the questions is 15.6. MP-DocVQA [358] 2023 contains 46K questions and 6K documents, with a total of 48K pages (images). On average, each question is associated with 8.27 pages. ChartX [404] 2024 collected 48K multi-modal chart data covering 22 topics, 18 chart types, and 7 tasks. Each chart data within this dataset includes 4 modalities, including image, Comma-Separated Values (CSV), python code, and text description. 7 chart tasks is classified into perception tasks and cognition tasks. DocGenome [403] 2024 constructed by annotating 500K scientific documents from 153 disciplines in the arXiv open-access community. It contains structure data from all modalities including 13 layout attributes along with their LATEX source codes. It provides 6 logical relationships between different entities within each scientific document. It covers various document-oriented tasks. CharXiv [387] 2024 involves 2,323 real-world charts handpicked from scientific papers spanning 8 major subjects published on arXiv, and produces more than 10K questions. MMLongBench-Doc [258] 2024 comprising 1,082 expert-annotated questions. It is constructed upon 135 lengthy PDF-formatted docu- ments with an average of 47.5 pages and 21,214 textual tokens. 494 questions are single-page questions (with one evidence page). 365 questions are cross-page questions requiring evidence across multiple pages. 223 questions are designed to be unanswerable for detecting potential hallucinations. ComTQA [486] 2024 comprises a total of 9,070 QA pairs across
