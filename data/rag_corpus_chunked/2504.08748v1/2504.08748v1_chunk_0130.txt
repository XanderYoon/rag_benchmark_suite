engagement. Advanced techniques, such as attention mechanisms, can analyze the narrative’s semantic and syntactic structure, enabling the model to determine where multimodal elements can comple- ment or enrich the text. Modern multimodal systems must dynamically retrieve or generate contextually relevant non-textual content. For example, when generating a text-image pair, the model should use cross-modal alignment techniques to either retrieve an existing image from a database or synthesize a new one that aligns with the textual context. This relies on robust multimodal representation learning, where embeddings from different modalities (text, image, video) are mapped into a shared latent space, enabling precise cross-modal retrieval or generation. • Diversity in Multimodal Outputs: Achieving a balance between diversity, relevance, and quality in multimodal generation requires controlled mechanisms. For instance, in text-to-image generation, models should produce diverse yet faithful representations of textual descriptions. Techniques like conditional sampling can guide models to explore varied latent spaces while adhering to input constraints. 7.5 Dataset & Evaluation The future direction of datasets and evaluation in MRAG should focus on addressing current gaps and challenges while harnessing the unique capabilities of MLLMs. Below are refined suggestions for advancing datasets and evaluation methodologies in this field. • Comprehensive Benchmark Development: To enhance the evaluation of MLLMs and LLMs in retrieval-augmented generation, it is crucial to develop comprehensive benchmarks that address key limitations in current assessment frameworks. These benchmarks should focus on the following areas: 1) Instruction Following: Create tasks to evaluate the model’s ability to comprehend and execute complex, multi-step instructions across diverse modalities. This includes assessing precision in adhering to nuanced directives and handling ambiguous or incomplete inputs. 2) Multiturn Dialogue: Develop datasets that simulate real-world conversational dynamics, emphasizing the model’s capacity for context retention, coherence, and adaptability over extended interactions. Scenarios should include cross-modal references and long-term memory
