multimodal data integration and improved the end-to-end user experience, it introduced significant limitations. For instance, the conversion process often resulted in the loss of modality- specific information, such as visual details in images or tonal nuances in audio, restricting the system’s ability to fully exploit the potential of multimodal inputs. Subsequent research has focused on addressing these limitations by developing more advanced methods to optimize MRAG systems. These advancements have substantially enhanced MRAG’s performance and versatility, achieving state-of-the-art results across various multimodal tasks. This paper categorizes the evolution of MRAG into three distinct stages: 2.1 MRAG1.0 The initial stage of the MRAG framework, commonly termed "pseudo-MRAG", emerged as a straightforward extension of the highly successful RAG paradigm. This stage was rapidly adopted due to its adherence to RAG’s core principles, with modifications to support multimodal data. As illustrated in Figure 1, the MRAG1.0 architecture consists of three key components: Document Parsing and Indexing, Retrieval, and Generation. • Document Parsing and Indexing: This component is responsible for processing multimodal documents in formats such as Word, Excel, PDF, and HTML. It extracts textual content using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) or format-specific parsing techniques. A document layout detection model is then utilized to segment the document into structured elements, including titles, paragraphs, images, videos, tables, and footers. For textual content, a chunking strategy is applied to segment or group semantically coherent passages. For multimodal data, specialized models are used to generate captions describing images, videos, and other non-textual elements. These chunks and captions are encoded into vector representations using an embedding model and stored in a vector database. The choice of embedding model is crucial, as it significantly impacts the performance and effectiveness of downstream retrieval tasks. • Retrieval: This component processes user queries by encoding them into vector representations using the same
