yielding more accurate, contextually relevant, and semantically rich outputs. This refinement process utilizes MLLMs’ contextual understanding and multimodal alignment to re-rank, filter, or augment retrieved content. , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: April 2018. 56 Trovato et al. 7.4 Generation The future of multimodal generation should focus on overcoming existing challenges on multimodal input and output. Below are key suggestions for advancing multimodal generation systems. • Flexible and Adaptive Multimodal Input Frameworks: To address the growing complexity of multimodal data, it is crucial to develop modality-agnostic architectures that dynamically adapt to diverse and arbitrary input modality combinations, such as text+image, text+video, or image+audio. These frameworks should process inputs without relying on predefined structures or extensive retraining. • Coherent and Contextually Relevant Multimodal Output: Achieving coherent and con- textually relevant outputs in multimodal generation necessitates the development of advanced models capable of maintaining consistency across modalities. For example, in text-image gen- eration tasks, the generated image must precisely align with the textual description, and the text should accurately reflect the visual content of the image. This cross-modal consistency is essential for ensuring the reliability and usability of multimodal systems. • Intelligent Positioning and Integration of Multimodal Elements: To seamlessly integrate non-textual elements (e.g., images, videos, audio) into a narrative, models must be trained to identify optimal insertion points. This requires a deep understanding of the content’s structure, flow, and contextual nuances to ensure coherence, readability, and enhanced user engagement. Advanced techniques, such as attention mechanisms, can analyze the narrative’s semantic and syntactic structure, enabling the model to determine where multimodal elements can comple- ment or enrich the text. Modern multimodal systems must dynamically retrieve or generate contextually relevant non-textual content. For example, when generating a text-image pair, the model should use cross-modal alignment techniques to either retrieve an
