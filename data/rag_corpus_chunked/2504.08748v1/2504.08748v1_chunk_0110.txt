MRAG systems, making it a critical tool in the field. The choice between coarse-grained and fine-grained evaluation depends on the assessment objectives. Coarse-grained methods are ideal for obtaining quick, high-level insights, whereas fine-grained approaches are better suited for detailed analysis and iterative model refinement. Integrating both strategies can provide a balanced perspective, combining the efficiency of coarse-grained evaluation with the precision of fine-grained analysis to comprehensively assess MRAG systems. 6 Challenges of MRAG In this section, we delineate the challenges associated with various modules in a MRAG system. These challenges span multiple critical components, including document parsing and indexing, search planning, retrieval, generation, dataset, and evaluation. Each module presents unique complexities that must be addressed to ensure the system’s effectiveness and robustness. 6.1 Document Parsing and Indexing Document parsing and indexing has established the data foundation based on MRAG, which plays a crucial role in the entire system. The relevant technologies extensively studied even before the advent of LLMs, have seen significant advancements in the LLM era. However, they continue to face several challenges that necessitate further exploration and refinement. • Challenges in Data Accuracy and Completeness: As the primary input source, the accuracy and completeness of upstream data are critical. Errors or omissions in the upstream data can propagate and amplify downstream, significantly degrading system performance. For example, while MRAG systems have enhanced document information preservation—such as capturing per-page screenshots—they still face challenges in maintaining inter-page relationships. This limitation is particularly problematic in long documents with associated segments. Preserving these relationships is essential for ensuring contextually accurate outputs. • Balancing Multimodal and Textual Data: The document parsing module has grown increas- ingly complex as modern MRAG systems must handle multimodal data, including images, tables, and text. To address this, contemporary approaches preserve the original multimodal inputs to minimize information
