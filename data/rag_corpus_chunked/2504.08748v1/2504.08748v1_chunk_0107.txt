the intended knowledge. Higher scores indicate stronger alignment with the ground truth, reflecting enhanced retrieval and generation capabilities. – Retrieved Context Precision: This metric measures the alignment between the knowledge in the retrieved context and the information in the ground truth response. It evaluates the , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: April 2018. 46 Trovato et al. proportion of relevant and accurate information in the retrieved context that is directly supported or entailed by the ground truth, assessing the retrieval system’s precision and contextual appropriateness in generating accurate responses. This metric is especially vital in multimodal RAG systems, where integrating diverse data types (e.g., text, images, audio) requires robust evaluation of relevance and precision across modalities. – Retrieved Context Recall: This metric measures the degree to which the retrieved context aligns with and encompasses the knowledge necessary to generate ground truth responses. It evaluates the proportion of relevant information from the ground truth captured within the retrieved context, serving as a key indicator of the retrieval system’s effectiveness in supporting accurate and comprehensive response generation. High values indicate that the retrieval mechanism effectively identifies and incorporates essential knowledge, thereby enhancing the overall performance of the MRAG system. – Faithfulness: This metric evaluates the extent to which generated text maintains factual consistency with the information in the retrieved documents, ensuring the output accurately reflects the source material and minimizes hallucinations or deviations from the evidence. In MRAG systems, it also ensures alignment with multimodal retrieved content, including textual, visual, and auditory elements, maintaining consistency across modalities. – Hallucination: This metric measures the proportion of generated outputs containing hal- lucinated content, such as unsupported claims, fabricated information, or inaccuracies not substantiated by the retrieved data. It is essential for evaluating the reliability and factual consistency of the model’s responses.
