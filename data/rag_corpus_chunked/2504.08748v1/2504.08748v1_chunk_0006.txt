modalities based on the MLLM. Considering the immense potential of MRAG in this field, this survey aims to systematically review and analyze the current state and main challenges of MRAG. We discuss existing research from several key perspectives: 1) What important components and technologies are involved in MRAG? 2) What types of datasets can be used for the evaluation of MRAG? 3) What methods and metrics are used to evaluate MRAG? 4) What limitations exist in the different aspects of MRAG? We explore the main challenges faced by MRAG, and hope to provide clearer guidelines for their future development. In summary, the main contributions of this paper are as follows: • Comprehensive and Timely Survey: We conducted an extensive survey on the emerging paradigm of multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation, systematically reviewing the current state of research and development in this field. • Systematic Analysis from Four Key Perspectives: Our survey is organized around four key aspects: essential components and technologies, datasets, evaluation methods and metrics, and limitations. This structured approach allows for a detailed understanding of how MRAG can be efficiently constructed, its reliability issues, and how it can be further improved. • Current Challenges and Future Research Directions: We discuss the existing challenges of MRAG, highlight potential research opportunities and directions, and provide a forward-looking perspective on the future development of this paradigm, encouraging researchers to delve deeper into this exciting field. We have provided an overall introduction to this survey paper. The section 2 presents a compre- hensive overview of multimodal retrieval-augmented generation, covering multiple developmental stages. The section 3 delves into the technical details of multimodal retrieval-augmented generation, focusing on key components such as multimodal retrieval, multimodal generation, etc. In section 4, we discuss how to comprehensively evaluate multimodal retrieval-augmented generation systems using datasets, including specialized assessments for
