adaptability needed to capture nuanced semantic or contextual understanding, especially in multimodal environments where text, images, and other data types interact. • LLM/MLLM-based Metrics: The emergence of LLMs and MLLMs has transformed evalua- tion paradigms, enabling the use of their advanced reasoning and comprehension capabilities. LLM/MLLM-based metrics now provide more holistic and context-aware assessments of MRAG systems, with key approaches including: – Answer Precision: This metric measures the degree to which the knowledge in a model- generated answer is supported or entailed by the ground truth. It assesses the accuracy and relevance of retrieved information by evaluating the overlap between the model’s output and the factual or contextual basis provided by the ground truth. High answer precision indicates that the model effectively utilizes retrieved multimodal data to produce responses aligned with the expected factual content. This metric is crucial for evaluating the reliability and factual consistency of multimodal RAG systems, ensuring that generated outputs are both contextually appropriate and informationally accurate. – Ground Truth Recall : This metric measures the degree to which the knowledge in the ground truth is accurately captured and reflected in the model-generated response. It assesses the model’s ability to retrieve and integrate relevant information from the provided knowledge base or multimodal sources, ensuring the output aligns with the factual or contextual details in the reference data. It is particularly crucial for evaluating retrieval-augmented systems, as it directly quantifies the fidelity of the model’s output to the intended knowledge. Higher scores indicate stronger alignment with the ground truth, reflecting enhanced retrieval and generation capabilities. – Retrieved Context Precision: This metric measures the alignment between the knowledge in the retrieved context and the information in the ground truth response.
