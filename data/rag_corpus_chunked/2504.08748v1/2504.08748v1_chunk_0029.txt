MLLMs. Empirical studies reveal a performance gap between multimodal and text-only retrieval, highlighting differences in effectiveness when using raw multimodal data versus text or combined modalities [312, 463]. Consequently, a new paradigm has emerged that leverages OCR for text indexing, document screenshots for multimodal indexing, and executes textual and visual RAG in parallel. The results from both streams are then fused through modality integration to produce the final answer [342]. 3.2 Multimodal Search Planning Multimodal search planning refers to the strategies employed by MRAG systems, to effectively retrieve and integrate information from multiple modalities to address complex queries. The planning can be broadly categorized into two main approaches: fixed planning and adaptive planning. 3.2.1 Fixed Planning. Early MRAG systems typically adopt fixed planning strategies for handling multimodal queries, characterized by predetermined processing pipelines that lack flexibility in adapting to diverse query requirements. These approaches can be broadly categorized based on their retrieval modality choices: • Planning for Single-modal Retrieval. Early fixed planning strategies usually focus on a single modality for retrieval, despite the multimodal nature of input queries. These approaches can be , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: April 2018. A Survey on Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation 15 broadly classified into text-centric and image-centric paradigms, reflecting initial efforts to adapt traditional IR query processing techniques [171, 184] to the multimodal domain. – Text-centric planning approaches prioritize textual retrieval by transforming multimodal queries into text-only formats. For instance, Plug-and-Play [ 357] employs vision-language models to convert the visual component of a query into textual descriptions, followed by text- based retrieval planning. This strategy simplifies the multimodal problem into a traditional text-based RAG pipeline, leveraging established multi-stage query processing techniques from conventional IR systems. However, this approach often introduces a semantic gap between the user’s original intent and the generated
