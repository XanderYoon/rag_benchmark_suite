this, multi-perspective reformulation strategies could be employed, leveraging diverse interpretations of the query to generate reformulations that better align with the original intent. Such strategies might integrate contextual under- standing, domain-specific knowledge, and cross-modal alignment techniques to ensure semantic consistency with the user’s intent. • Comprehensive Evaluation Benchmarks: The third critical challenge is the absence of com- prehensive evaluation benchmarks capable of assessing planning mechanisms across diverse query complexities and scenarios. Existing benchmarks often focus on narrow performance aspects, failing to capture the full spectrum of real-world applications. To address this gap, future benchmarks should evaluate systems across multiple dimensions, including adaptability to query diversity, robustness in handling complex queries, and efficiency in resource utilization. These benchmarks should incorporate a wide range of query types, from simple factual retrievals to multi-hop reasoning and creative tasks, ensuring rigorous testing under realistic conditions. Addi- tionally, benchmarks should incorporate metrics for semantic alignment in query reformulation, computational efficiency, and scalability. , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article .

A Survey on Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation 49 These interconnected challenges highlight the need for future research to develop adaptive planning mechanisms capable of addressing both query diversity and complexity. This could involve multi- agent coordination for advanced cases, alongside robust query reformulation and comprehensive evaluation frameworks. 6.3 Retrieval Multimodal retrieval has made significant progress but continues to face challenges that can be categorized into methodological and practical issues. These challenges arise from the inherent complexity of integrating and retrieving information across diverse data modalities such as text, images, audio, and video. Below, we outline the key challenges in this field: • Heterogeneity of Cross-Modal Data : The heterogeneity of data across modalities poses a significant challenge in multimodal retrieval and representation learning. Text, being sequential and discrete, relies on syntactic and semantic
