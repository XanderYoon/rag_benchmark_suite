30 minutes. Finally, these videos is annotated to select a subset of 103 videos. Event-Bench [71] 2024 includes 6 event-related tasks and 2,190 test instances. VNBench [488] 2024 1,350 samples with 9 sub-tasks. TempCompass [232] 2024 collects a total of 410 videos and 500 pieces of meta-information, with 9 content categories. MovieChat [332] 2024 1K long videos and 13K manual question-answering pairs. Industry MME-Industry [429] 2025 encompasses 21 distinct domain, comprising 1050 question-answer pairs with 50 questions per domain. Conversational QA SparklesDialogue [134] 2023 SparklesDialogueCC comprises 4.5K dialogues, each consisting of at least two images spanning two conversational turns. SparklesDialogueVG includes 2K dialogues, each with at least three distinct images across two turns. SciGraphQA [192] 2023 selected 290,000 Computer Science or Machine Learning ArXiv papers, and then used Palm-2 to generate 295K samples of open-vocabulary multi-turn question-answering dialogues about the graphs. As context, it provided the text-only Palm-2 with paper title, abstract, paragraph mentioning the graph, and rich text contextual data from the graph itself, obtaining dialogues with an average 2.23 question-answer turns for each graph. ConvBench [225] 2024 comprises 577 image-instruction pairs tailored for multi-round conversations. Each pair is structured around three sequential instructions, each targeting a distinct cognitive skill—beginning with perception, followed by reasoning, and culminating in creation. Encompassing 215 tasks, the benchmark is divided into 71 tasks focused on perception, 65 on reasoning, and 79 on creation. , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: April 2018. A Survey on Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation 43 MMDU [235] 2024 comprises 110 multi-image multi-turn dialogues with more than 1600 questions, each accompanied by detailed long-form answers. The questions in MMDU involve 2 to 20 images, with an average image&text token length of 8.2k tokens, a maximum turn length of 27, and a maximum image&text length reaching 18K tokens.
