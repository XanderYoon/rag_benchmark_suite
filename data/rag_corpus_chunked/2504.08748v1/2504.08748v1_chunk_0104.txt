in NLP for evaluating the quality of machine-generated text by assessing its similarity to one or more reference texts. Initially designed for machine translation, BLEU has been adapted to various NLP tasks, including multimodal generation. In multimodal settings, BLEU can evaluate the alignment between generated text and associated modalities (e.g., images, videos) by comparing the output to reference descriptions or captions. However, while BLEU offers a quantitative measure of n-gram overlap, it has limitations in capturing semantic depth, contextual coherence, and multimodal consistency, which are essential for comprehensive evaluation in MRAG systems. – Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR): MRR is a widely used metric for evaluating the performance of systems that produce ranked lists of results, such as search engines, recommendation systems, or retrieval-augmented models. MRR measures the rank position of the first relevant item in the returned list, reflecting the system’s ability to surface correct or useful information quickly. It is calculated as the average of the reciprocal ranks of the first relevant result across multiple queries or tasks. A higher MRR indicates better performance, as it demonstrates the system’s effectiveness in prioritizing relevant results at the top of the list. , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article .

A Survey on Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation 45 – CIDEr (Consensus-based Image Description Evaluation): CIDEr is specifically designed to measure the agreement between machine-generated captions and human-authored reference captions. It utilizes a TF-IDF weighting mechanism to quantify the similarity between generated and reference texts. – SPICE (Semantic Propositional Image Caption Evaluation) : The evaluation of MRAG systems frequently utilizes the SPICE metric to assess the quality of generated captions. SPICE prioritizes semantic fidelity by parsing captions into structured scene graphs, which depict objects, attributes, and relationships within the text. These generated scene graphs are subsequently compared to reference graphs
