highlights three critical challenges that must be addressed to advance the field. • Intelligent Adaptive Planning Mechanisms: The primary challenge is developing intelligent adaptive planning mechanisms that can dynamically adjust to the diversity and complexity of queries. Current systems often rely on predetermined pipelines, which fail to accommodate variations in query characteristics or computational constraints, leading to inefficient resource allocation and suboptimal performance [125, 474]. While fixed strategies may suffice for homo- geneous query types, real-world applications handle heterogeneous query patterns that demand dynamic adjustment of retrieval strategies. For example, complex queries involving multi-hop reasoning or creative problem-solving could greatly benefit from a multi-agent collaborative approach [369]. In such a framework, specialized agents could explore parallel reasoning paths, propose complementary retrieval strategies, and collaboratively synthesize findings to construct comprehensive search plans. This collaborative paradigm not only simulates diverse perspec- tives but also facilitates intricate interactions between knowledge sources and reasoning steps. By evaluating search plans from multiple angles, such systems can balance effectiveness and efficiency, ensuring robust performance across diverse query types. • Query Reformulation and Semantic Alignment: A second major challenge is query reformu- lation, particularly in maintaining semantic alignment between the original multimodal query intent and the reformulated queries [197]. As queries become more sophisticated, accurately capturing and maintaining their intent grows increasingly complex. This challenge is amplified in multimodal contexts, where queries may integrate text, images, audio, or other data types, each requiring precise interpretation. To address this, multi-perspective reformulation strategies could be employed, leveraging diverse interpretations of the query to generate reformulations that better align with the original intent. Such strategies might integrate contextual under- standing, domain-specific knowledge, and cross-modal alignment techniques to ensure semantic consistency with the user’s intent. • Comprehensive Evaluation Benchmarks: The third critical challenge is the absence of com- prehensive evaluation benchmarks
