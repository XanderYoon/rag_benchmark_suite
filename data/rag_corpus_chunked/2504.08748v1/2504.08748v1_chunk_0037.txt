However, early sparse retrieval methods face limitations, such as assuming term independence and relying on lexical matching, which hinders their ability to capture contextual term importance or semantic relationships between terms.

The architectures of retriever in multimodal retrieval. methods struggle to understand deeper textual meanings and contextual relevance between queries and documents. Recent advancements in sparse retrieval models have been driven by the integration of pre-trained language models (PLMs). While these approaches leverage PLMs, they remain fundamentally rooted in lexical matching, enabling the reuse of traditional sparse index structures by incorporating auxiliary information such as contextualized embeddings [94, 208] and extended tokens [83, 84, 284]. This research domain focuses on two main approaches: term weighting and term expansion. Term
