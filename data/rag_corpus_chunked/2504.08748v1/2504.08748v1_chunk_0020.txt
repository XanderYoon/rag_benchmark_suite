such as the web or a knowledge base, by querying and filtering potential candidates that best match the text’s context and intent. 3) Matching and Insertion: The system selects the most appropriate multimodal element from the retrieved candidate set based on relevance, quality, and coherence. The chosen data is then seamlessly integrated into the identified positions, producing a cohesive and enriched multimodal answer. 2.3.3 New Modules. • Multimodal Search Planning: This module tackles key decision-making challenges in MRAG systems by focusing on two core tasks: retrieval classification and query reformulation. Given a multimodal query Q = (𝑞, 𝑣), where 𝑞 is the textual component and 𝑣 is the visual component, the module is designed to optimize information acquisition. Specifically, retrieval classification involves determining the relevance and category of the multimodal query to guide the search toward the most appropriate data sources. Query reformulation, on the other hand, refines the , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: April 2018. A Survey on Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation 11 query by integrating textual and visual cues to improve retrieval accuracy and comprehensive- ness. By combining these tasks, the module strengthens the system’s ability to handle complex multimodal inputs, ensuring more effective and contextually relevant information retrieval. – Retrieval Classification: This task determines the optimal retrieval strategy 𝑎∗ from the action space A = {𝑎𝑛𝑜𝑛𝑒, 𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 , 𝑎𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑔𝑒 } based on the current query and optionally the retrieved historical documents. The decision process is formulated as: 𝑎∗ = 𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑎∈ A F𝑅𝐶 (𝑎 | Q , D) (1) where the retrieval control module F𝑅𝐶 evaluates the utility of retrieval actions by considering query characteristics, the MLLM’s inherent capabilities, and, when available, the retrieved documents D from previous iterations. For example, in multi-hop scenarios, after retrieving visual information in the initial round, the module
