language models (MLLMs) with human intuition, HITL systems enhance adaptability, build trust, and improve the robustness of intelligent planning frameworks. This collaborative approach is particularly valuable in domains requiring nuanced understanding, creativity, or domain-specific knowledge. – Reinforcement Learning for Adaptation: Intelligent adaptive planning mechanisms can be developed using reinforcement learning (RL) to enable dynamic, context-aware decision- making. By modeling the search process as a sequential decision problem, RL agents can be trained to optimize resource allocation and retrieval accuracy. These agents adapt their strategies by receiving rewards for minimizing computational overhead, reducing latency, and delivering precise results tailored to query characteristics, such as modality, complexity, and user intent. • Query Reformulation and Semantic Alignment: – Multi-Perspective Reformulation: To address the complexity of multimodal search, query reformulation strategies must generate diverse interpretations while preserving the original intent across modalities. This involves: 1) Contextual Understanding: Leveraging contextual embeddings (e.g., from transformer-based models) to capture semantic nuances and contex- tual dependencies, ensuring reformulated queries retain the richness of the original input. 2) Cross-Modal Alignment: Employing advanced techniques like contrastive learning to align rep- resentations across text, images, and audio modalities. By embedding queries and multimodal data into a shared latent space, this ensures consistent interpretation and retrieval across diverse data types. 3) Domain-Specific Knowledge Integration: Incorporating domain-specific ontologies or knowledge graphs to enhance reformulation accuracy, particularly in specialized fields. This leverages structured domain knowledge to improve the relevance and precision of reformulated queries. – Interactive Query Refinement: A pivotal strategy is interactive query refinement, which allows users to iteratively adjust queries based on intermediate results. Intelligent systems can facilitate this process by suggesting alternative query formulations, identifying ambiguities, and providing contextual feedback to better align queries with user intent. By integrating user feedback loops and real-time semantic analysis, these systems dynamically bridge the
