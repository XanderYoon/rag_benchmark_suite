handle the complexities of long documents, ensuring accurate maintenance and leveraging of contextual relationships for enhanced performance in multimodal document understanding tasks. This is particularly relevant when combining Optical Character Recognition (OCR), LLMs, and MLLMs to process and interpret documents with diverse content types. , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: April 2018. 52 Trovato et al. – Error Detection and Correction: To improve the accuracy and reliability of multimodal document parsing, integrating advanced error detection and correction mechanisms is crucial. Leveraging LLMs and MLLMs, systems can validate extracted text against the original docu- ment, identifying and correcting inaccuracies or omissions. These models can be enhanced with consistency-checking algorithms to ensure coherence and accuracy across multimodal data, including text, images, and tables. For critical documents, a human-in-the-loop (HITL) approach is advisable. This involves human reviewers verifying and refining parsed data, especially in cases where systems may struggle with complex layouts, ambiguous content, or domain-specific nuances. By combining the strengths of LLMs, MLLMs, and human ex- pertise, this hybrid approach ensures high accuracy and reliability, making it suitable for precision-demanding applications such as legal, medical, or financial document processing. • Improving Multimodal Data Integration: – Unified Multimodal Representation: Advancing multimodal document parsing requires the development of unified representation frameworks that seamlessly integrate diverse data types, such as text, images, and tables, into a cohesive structure. Such frameworks enable robust, context-aware analysis by leveraging multimodal transformers—like CLIP, Flamingo, or other state-of-the-art models—to encode disparate modalities into a shared embedding space. This interoperability enhances downstream tasks, including information extraction, question answering, and summarization. A promising approach involves hybrid strategies that combine raw multimodal data with textual representations. For instance, raw images can support visual tasks (e.g., object detection or layout analysis), while textual captions or OCR-derived text can improve text generation
