contains two sub-tasks: attribute recognition and spatial relationship reasoning. The attribute recognition task has 115 samples. The spatial relationship reasoning task has 76 samples. MME-RealWorld [480] 2024 contains 29,429 question-answer pairs that cover 43 subtasks across 5 real-world scenarios, where each one has at least 100 questions. Visual COT [324] 2024 438k visual chain-of-thought question-answer pairs spans across five distinct domains, each consisting of a question, an answer, and an intermediate bounding box as CoT contexts. About 98k question-answer pairs include extra detailed reasoning steps. Mementos [381] 2024 It consists of 4,761 image sequences with varying episode lengths, encompassing diverse scenarios from dailylife, robotics tasks, and comic-style storyboards. Each sequence is paired with a human-annotated description of the primary objects and their behaviors within the sequence. MIRB [482] 2024 comprises 925 samples with average image number of 3.78, constructed from four distinct categories of multi-image understanding: perception, visual world knowledge, reasoning, and multi-hop reasoning. , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: April 2018. A Survey on Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation 41 ReMI [162] 2024 It consists of 13 tasks that span a range of domains and properties. The tasks require reasoning over up to six images, with all tasks requiring reasoning over at least two images. The images comprise a variety of heterogeneous image types. MuirBench [368] 2024 It consists of 12 distinctive multi-image understanding tasks that involve 10 categories of multi-image relations, comprising 11,264 images and 2,600 multiple-choice questions, with an average of 4.3 images per instance. VEGA [493] 2024 contains 50k scientific literature entries, over 200k question-and-answer pairs, and a rich trove of 400k images. It includes the Interleaved Image-Text Comprehension subset, which is segmented into two categories based on token length: one supports up to 4,000 tokens, while the other extends to 8,000 tokens. Here, images
