We demonstrate that the generated con- texts substantially enrich the semantics of the queries and G AR with sparse representations (BM25) achieves comparable or better per- formance than state-of-the-art dense retrieval methods such as DPR (Karpukhin et al., 2020). We show that generating diverse contexts for a query is beneﬁcial as fusing their results con- sistently yields better retrieval accuracy. More- over, as sparse and dense representations are often complementary, GAR can be easily com- bined with DPR to achieve even better per- formance. G AR achieves state-of-the-art per- formance on Natural Questions and TriviaQA datasets under the extractive QA setup when equipped with an extractive reader, and con- sistently outperforms other retrieval methods when the same generative reader is used.1 1 Introduction Open-domain question answering (OpenQA) aims to answer factoid questions without a pre-speciﬁed domain and has numerous real-world applications. In OpenQA, a large collection of documents (e.g., Wikipedia) are often used to seek information per- taining to the questions. One of the most com- mon approaches uses a retriever-reader architecture (Chen et al., 2017), which ﬁrst retrieves a small sub- set of documents using the question as the query and then reads the retrieved documents to extract (or generate) an answer. The retriever is crucial as it is infeasible to examine every piece of information in the entire document collection ( e.g., millions of Wikipedia passages) and the retrieval accuracy bounds the performance
