Relevant and irrelevant contexts are shown in green and red. Ground-truth references are shown in the {braces}. The issue of generating wrong answers is alleviated by generating other contexts highly related to the question/answer. better performance on Trivia. 6.1 Query Context Generation Automatic Evaluation. To evaluate the quality of the generated query contexts, we ﬁrst measure their lexical overlap with the ground-truth query contexts. As suggested by the nontrivial ROUGE scores in Table 3, GAR does learn to generate meaningful query contexts that could help the re- trieval stage. We next measure the lexical overlap between the query and the ground-truth passage. The ROUGE-1/2/L F1 scores between the original query and ground-truth passage are 6.00/2.36/5.01, and those for the generation-augmented query are 7.05/2.84/5.62 (answer), 13.21/6.99/10.27 (sen- tence), 7.13/2.85/5.76 (title) on NQ, respectively. Such results further demonstrate that the generated query contexts signiﬁcantly increase the word over- lap between the queries and the positive passages, and thus are likely to improve retrieval results.6 Case Studies . In Table 2, we show several ex- amples of the generated query contexts and their ground-truth references. In the ﬁrst example, the correct album release date appears in both the gen- erated answer and the generated sentence, and the generated title is the same as the Wikipedia page 6We use F1 instead of recall
