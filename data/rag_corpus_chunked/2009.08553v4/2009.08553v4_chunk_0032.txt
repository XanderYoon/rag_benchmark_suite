GAR achieves better results than DPR whenk≥ 5. We show in Table 9 the retrieval accuracy break- down using the question-answer overlap categories. The most signiﬁcant gap between BM25 and other methods is on the Question Overlap category, which coincides with the fact that BM25 is un- able to conduct question paraphrasing (semantic matching). GAR helps BM25 to bridge the gap by providing the query contexts and even outperform DPR in this category. Moreover, GAR consistently improves over BM25 on other categories andGAR + outperforms DPR as well.
