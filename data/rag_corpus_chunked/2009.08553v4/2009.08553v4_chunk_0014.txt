We use Anserini (Yang et al., 2017) for text retrieval of BM25 and GAR with its default parameters. We conduct grid search for the QE baseline RM3 (Abdul-Jaleel et al., 2004). Generator. We use BART-large (Lewis et al., 2019) to generate query contexts in GAR. When there are multiple desired targets (such as multi- ple answers or titles), we concatenate them with [SEP] tokens as the reference and remove the [SEP] tokens in the generation-augmented queries. For Trivia, in particular, we use the value ﬁeld as the generation target of answer and observe better per- formance. We take the checkpoint with the best ROUGE-1 F1 score on the validation set, while observing that the retrieval accuracy of GAR is rel- atively stable to the checkpoint selection since we do not directly use the generated contexts but treat them as augmentation of queries for retrieval. Reader. Extractive GAR uses the reader of DPR with largely the same hyperparameters, which is initialized with BERT-base (Devlin et al., 2019) and takes 100 (500) retrieved passages during train- ing (inference). Generative GAR concatenates the question and top-10 retrieved passages, and takes at most 1,024 tokens as input. Greedy decoding is adopted for all generation models, which appears to perform similarly to (more expensive) beam search. 6 Experiment Results We evaluate the effectiveness of GAR in three stages: generation of query contexts (Sec. 6.1), retrieval of relevant passages (Sec. 6.2), and pas- sage reading for OpenQA (Sec. 6.3).
