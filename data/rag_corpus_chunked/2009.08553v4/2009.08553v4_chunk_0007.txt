the documents D⊂ C and the reader reads the documents D to extract (or generate) an answer. Our goal is to improve the effectiveness and efﬁ- ciency of the retriever and consequently improve the performance of the reader. 3.2 Generation of Query Contexts In GAR, queries are augmented with various heuris- tically discovered relevant contexts in order to re- trieve more relevant passages in terms of both quan- tity and quality. For the task of OpenQA where the query is a question, we take the following three freely accessible contexts as the generation targets. We show in Sec. 6.2 that having multiple gener- ation targets is helpful in that fusing their results consistently brings better retrieval accuracy. Context 1: The default target (answer). The de- fault target is the label in the task of interest, which is the answer in OpenQA. The answer to the ques- tion is apparently useful for the retrieval of relevant passages that contain the answer itself. As shown in previous work (Roberts et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2020), PLMs are able to answer certain questions solely by taking the questions as input (i.e., closed- book QA). Instead of using the generated answers directly as in closed-book QA, GAR treats them as contexts of the question for retrieval. The ad- vantage is that even if the generated answers are partially correct (or even incorrect), they may still beneﬁt retrieval as long as they are relevant to the passages that contain the correct answers (e.g., co- occur with the correct answers). Context 2: Sentence containing the default tar- get. The sentence in a passage that contains the answer is used as another generation target. Sim- ilar to using answers as the generation target, the generated sentences are still beneﬁcial for retriev- ing relevant passages even if
