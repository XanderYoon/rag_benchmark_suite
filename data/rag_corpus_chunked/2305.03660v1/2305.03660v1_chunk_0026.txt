of cases where the Semb scores were less between the retrieved context sentence corpus and the generations from the LLM model. Semb uses CheXbert model to calculate the cosine similarity between the embeddings from the ﬁnal hidden state repre- sentations and can give an indication of hallucination. We see there are no hallucinations. Semb Context Records (K=3) RAG Impression 0.1508 Lung volumes with right basi- lar atelectasis versus consoli- dation which could represent pneumonia in the right clini- cal context. Low lung volumes with bibasilar opacities which may represent atelectasis ver- sus aspiration. Low lung vol- umes with bibasilar opacities which could potentially be due to atelectasis. Right basilar atelectasis and consolidation likely due to pneumonia. Bibasilar opaci- ties may be due to atelectasis or aspiration. Low lung vol- umes present. 0.2116 The left lung remains grossly clear, although there is mini- mal linear opacity at the left costophrenic angle, which may represent post - inﬂammatory scarring or subsegmental at- electasis. There is a sugges- tion of a tiny left apical pneu- mothorax which me if there is attempted line placement from the left side prior to the right. There is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette there is sug- gestion of some mild engorge- ment of pulmonary vessels on the left, raising the possibility of asymmetric elevation of pul- monary venous pressure. The left lung is clear with minimal linear opacity at the left costophrenic angle. Tiny left apical pneumotho- rax and mild engorgement of pulmonary vessels on the left suggest asymmetric elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Enlargement of cardiac silhou- ette noted. 19 CXR-RePaiR-Gen Table 10: RAG based report generation metrics at diﬀerent temperature settings for the text-davinci-003 model using the sentence corpus and top K retrievals set to K=3.
