This approach keeps hallucinated generations under check and provides capabilities to gen- erate report content in the format we desire leveraging the instruction following capa- bilities of these generative models. Our approach achieves better clinical metrics with a BERTScore of 0.2865 (∆+ 25.88 %) and Semb score of 0.4026 (∆+ 6.31 %). Our approach can be broadly relevant for diﬀerent clinical settings as it allows to augment the automated radiology report generation process with content relevant for that setting while also having the ability to inject user intents and requirements in the prompts as part of the report gen- eration process to modulate the content and format of the generated reports as applicable for that clinical setting. 1. Introduction Automated Radiology Report Generation Systems can improve the report writing workﬂow of radiologists in various ways. These AI systems can generate free text content or structured report content for review by the radiologists w.r.t various attributes of interests like organ ∗ MR is also associated with Microsoft Research, Bangalore † RM is also associated with Databricks Inc., Bangalore © M.
