Generation Systems can improve the report writing workﬂow of radiologists in various ways. These AI systems can generate free text content or structured report content for review by the radiologists w.r.t various attributes of interests like organ ∗ MR is also associated with Microsoft Research, Bangalore † RM is also associated with Databricks Inc., Bangalore © M.

(2020); Miura et al. (2020)]. An interesting recent work CXR-RePaiR [Endo et al. (2021)] cast it as a retrieval problem taking advantage of the ﬁnite set of diagnostic details and attributes associated with radiology images. This approach is powerful in that it can leverage a very large database of past and present radiological reports while making im- pression recommendations. But all these approaches suﬀer from various issues related to irrelevant content or hallucinations in the generations. A very recent work CXR-ReDonE by Ramesh et al. (2022) addressed one such issue in report generation related to prior references by creating a new dataset CXR-PRO [Ramesh et al.] that eliminated the prior references found in the radiology text reports of MIMIC- CXR [Johnson et al. (2019)] and used this dataset to improve CXR-RePaiR [Endo et al. (2021)] to establish a new SOTA benchmark in radiology report impression generations. But purely retrieval-based report writing models like CXR-RepaiR and CXR-ReDonE does not allow the user to modulate the retrievals per their need which is useful for appli- cability in various clinical settings. Below are some limitations with pure retrieval-based approaches, some of
