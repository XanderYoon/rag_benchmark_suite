in the retrieved context documents were not included in the ﬁnal impression. • Out of 87 references to previous/prior reports, 80 references were successfully excluded in the impression. Some sample cases where the prior report references and follow-up actions were removed based on the instructions in the prompt are shown in Table 7 4.8. Modulate Report Generation Format One of the key advantages of RAG is the ability to modulate output generation format via prompt engineering. Table 8 shows the report generation outputs in a structured json format extracting the attributes of interest using the few shot prompts in Table 2. 14 CXR-RePaiR-Gen Table 6: Examples from MS-CXR dataset: Generated reports compared to the reference report and the baseline method CXR-RedonE. RAG based generations from CXR-RepaiR- Gen avoids noisy and duplicate details in its generation and still retains the important clinical entities. Outputs were generated at top K retrievals set to 3. Ground Truth CXR-ReDonE (K=3) CXR-RepaiR-Gen (K=3) (text-davinci-003) Subtle opacity in the left peri- hilar region Vague asymmetric opac- ity in the left lower lobe which may represent an area of early infection. Vague left infrahilar den- sity , possibly associated with lower airway inﬂamma- tion or infection , or poten- tially early or mild bronchop- neumonia , but not of deﬁnite signiﬁcance.Indeterminate 3 cm ovoid density in the left lung base with possible retrocardiac correlate on lat- eral view. Vague asymmetric opacity in the left lower lobe is suggestive of early infection or developing pneumonia, depending on the clinical scenario. Left lower lobe consolidation due to pneumonia More conﬂuent basilar opac- ities may reﬂect dependent edema , but aspiration and infectious pneumonia should also be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.Retrocardiac opacity likely reﬂects basilar atelec- tasis , however infection or aspiration may produce a similar appearance ,
