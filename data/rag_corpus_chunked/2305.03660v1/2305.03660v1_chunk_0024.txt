generated report impression and the retrieved context from the sentence corpus with K=3 top K retrievals. We ﬁnd that the average similarity score is 0.8466 and around 87% of the test impressions have a Semb > 0.70 which is a good indication that the generations did not hallucinate. Table 9 presents a couple of records which had the lowest Semb scores in the test set. We ﬁnd that even such records did not hallucinate, and the lowest scores may be attributed to the concise impression summary generated. 5. Discussion We ﬁnd that CXR-RepaiR-Gen - Retrieval Augmented Generation based approach for radi- ology report impression generation using embeddings from contrastively pretrained model CXR-ReDonE for retrieval of relevant radiology text and OpenAI LLM models for gener- ation can help generate very concise and precise radiology report impressions and improve the clinical eﬃcacy metrics speciﬁcally the BERTScore and Semb scores without compro- mising on retaining the relevant clinical entities. We also ﬁnd that the LLM based report generations via few shot prompts and instructions allow for modulation of report outputs for desired content and format and helps reduce noisier text (like recommendations for further evaluation, prior report mentions, speciﬁc patient details etc) and avoids repeating content in the impressions which are the typical issues with a pure retrieval-based setup. We note that these limitations were mentioned in the CXR-RePaiR paper which warranted the requirement to have a template database that removed these noisy details or dupli- cates and use the template database for performing the retrievals for better quality report generation. We see that RAG based generation can address this limitation via eﬀective prompt engineering and also using approaches like structured content extraction with few shot prompts to extract only the attributes of interest and produce a more concise, precise, and complete impression
