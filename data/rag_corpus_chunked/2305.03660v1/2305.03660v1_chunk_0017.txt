Results – CXR-PRO We evaluate the performance of radiology report impressions generated using a purely retrieval-based approach in CXR-ReDonE as our baseline. We ﬁnd that RAG based gen- erations improves the BERTScore metrics for both report and sentence corpus retrievals bringing in an absolute improvement of 5.06% at k=3 for sentence-based retrieval. Simi- larly, it also improves Semb scores for both report and sentence corpus retrievals, bringing in an absolute improvement of 2.43% at k=3 for sentence-based retrieval. RadGraph F1 metric that measures the retrievals of clinical entities is on par with CXR-ReDonE at k=3 and slightly lower at lower k values. We should note that our approach generates the im- pressions on the augmented data so we cannot exceed CXR-ReDonE on RadGraph F1 as otherwise we are hallucinating clinical entities not based on the context. The evaluation metrics are available in Table 3. 4.5. Results – MS-CXR Our approach improves the BERTScore on MS-CXR phrase grounding text by an absolute value of 8.67 and Semb by an absolute value of 3.86. The evaluation metrics are available in Table 4. 11 CXR-RePaiR-Gen Table 4: Evaluation of CXR-RePaiR-Gen on MS-CXR phrases using text-davinci-003 for sentence corpus-based retrieval at k = 3. Metrics evaluated are BERTScore, Semb and Rad- Graph F1. Our approach outperforms the baseline on both the clinical metrics BERTScore and Semb and at par for RadGraph F1. Italics denotes improvement over the baseline, while bold denotes the highest value obtained by our approach.
