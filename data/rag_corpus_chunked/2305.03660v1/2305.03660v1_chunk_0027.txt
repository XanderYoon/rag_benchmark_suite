GPT-3 Hyperparameters We tried with temperature values of 0, 0.5 and 1 for the zero shot impression generations from the text-davinci-003 model using the top K retrievals(K=3) from the sentence level corpus as the context. We found that it did not inﬂuence the output scores much as seen from Table 10. The instruction to use retrieved sentence corpus as context for generations may be responsible for this behavior.
