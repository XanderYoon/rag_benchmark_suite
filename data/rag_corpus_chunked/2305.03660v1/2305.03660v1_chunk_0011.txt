an adapted version of the MIMIC-CXR dataset [Johnson et al. (2019)]] with prior references omitted. It addresses 6 CXR-RePaiR-Gen the issue of hallucinated reference to priors produced by radiology report generation models. We use the impressions sections of the radiology reports in the corpus and consider both report-level impressions and as well as the sentences comprising the report-level impressions as the retrieval corpus for report generation as in CXR-RePaiR [Endo et al. (2021)] 3.2. Baselines We consider CXR-ReDonE [Ramesh et al. (2022)] which does retrieval-based report gener- ation with CXR-PRO dataset [Ramesh et al.] as the retrieval corpus as our baseline. We aim to see if retrieval augmented generation using LLMs on top of these retrievals can help improve radiology report generation clinical metrics. 3.3. Prompt Design We design two sets of prompts to generate the radiology report as free-text report, one for the text-davinci-003 model and another for report generation in the conversational setup with the gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4 model as shown in Table 1 We provide instructions to the LLM to use the retrieved sentences as a context to generate the radiology report. For gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4 the prompt design involves system prompt and a user prompt in a conversation setting. The system prompt instructs the system to generate a radiology report impression from the context that the user will send. The user prompt sends the retrieved records as a context requesting the system to provide the radiology report as a response. 3.4. Structured Report Output We also experiment with the ability to modulate the report generation output with speciﬁ- cations on the desired report output format in the prompts as few shot examples. It can be interesting for the radiologist and downstream applications to generate certain attributes of interest from the radiology report apart from generating the
