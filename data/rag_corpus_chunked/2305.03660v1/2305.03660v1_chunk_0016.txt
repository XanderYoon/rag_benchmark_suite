we can format the output the generated impression as per user requirements. At this point in time these are not quantitatively measured but we show qualitative outputs for structured generation. 4.3. Measuring Hallucinations We also qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate if the report impression summary hallu- cinates from the top K sentences corpus given to the LLM as context. We use the Semb score between the LLM generations and the top-k context records to see if they semantically equivalent. 10 CXR-RePaiR-Gen Table 3: Evaluation of CXR-RePaiR-Gen(RAG based approach) on CXR-PRO test im- pressions for report corpus retrieval and sentence corpus retrieval. Metrics evaluated are BERTScore, Semb score and RadGraph F1. Our approach outperforms the baseline on both the clinical metrics BERTScore and Semb score for both the report and sentence corpus- based retrieval for all values of K and at par with CXR-ReDonE for RadGraph F1 at k=3. Italics denote improvement over the baseline, bold denotes the highest value obtained by our approach at the highest value of RadGraph F1 which is at k=3. We should note that CXR-RePaiR-Gen (based on RAG) cannot exceed CXR-ReDonE on the RadGraphF1 score as otherwise it means we are hallucinating on the clinical entities which are not present in the context.

Results – CXR-PRO We evaluate the performance of radiology report impressions generated using a purely retrieval-based approach in CXR-ReDonE as our baseline. We ﬁnd that RAG based gen- erations improves the BERTScore metrics for both report and sentence
