Results on Real Data 4.1. Evaluation Dataset We evaluate the performance on two golden benchmark datasets, MS-CXR [Boecking et al.] and the test impressions from the CXR-PRO dataset [Ramesh et al.] . Both datasets are created with the help of board-certiﬁed radiologists. CXR-PRO consists of 2,188 radiology images and associated reports. CXR-PRO dataset was preprocessed to remove duplicate lines. MS-CXR dataset provides 1162 image–sentence pairs across eight diﬀerent cardiopul- monary radiological ﬁndings. Both these datasets though from the same data distribution are diﬀerent, MS-CXR is a phrase grounding dataset which also contains bounding boxes to ground the phrases on the radiology image, it contains very precise and concise phrases whereas CXR-PRO has longer text for the impressions. We evaluate the performance across these two setups as in some clinical settings it may be required to give precise and concise phrases about the radiology image. 4.2. Evaluation Approach We evaluate the free text radiology impressions generated using the LLMs from the retrieved records of the report level corpus and sentence level corpus. For sentence level corpus we evaluate the impressions generated from top K sentence retrievals with K= 1, 2, 3. Our
