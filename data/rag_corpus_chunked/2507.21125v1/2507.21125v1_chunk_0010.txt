( ≥ 0.75) of its constituent meaningful words appear in the source text. Furthermore, candidates are provisionally retained if they were assigned a very high confidence score ( ≥ 0.95) by the initial LLM. As a final validation measure for candidates with at least moderate initial confidence (≥ 0.75) that did not meet the preceding criteria, their semantic similarity to the entire input text is calculated using a spaCy model. if this similarity exceeds a predefined threshold (≥ 0.70), the term is included. All these steps were designed to catch the probable hallucinations of the LLM from the first step. Proceeding from this stage, a refined, yet still broad, list of candidate phrases has been created. Yet their status as ‘technology’ needs to be validated. Therefore, a novel LLM-based validation method was subsequently employed for this critical technology identification task. 4) LLM-based Definitional Validation : The fourth stage of the RATE pipeline subjects the output list of the previous step to a definitional assessment using a second LLM instance. DeepSeek-V3 with the exact same settings as the previous step was incorporated in this step. For each candidate phrase, LLM was provided with both the phrase itself and the complete original input text to ensure a comprehensive contextual eval- uation. Central to this validation is a detailed system prompt that instructs LLM to act as an expert technology analyst. Its core task is to precisely evaluate whether the candidate, viewed within its specific textual context, qualifies as a technology or not. To enhance the understanding of the LLM from technology, four distinct, pre-defined scholarly definitions of technology based on the works of Puccetti et al. that were explicitly provided in its instructions [16]. The prompt further guides the LLM to focus its interpretation of these definitions on tangible, applied technical implementations,
