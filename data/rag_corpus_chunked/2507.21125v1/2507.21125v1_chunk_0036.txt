weaker linkage of terms like ”Metaverse” to core EEG or AI hubs in the network might suggest that, within this specific corpus and timeframe (2000- 2024), its deep integration with foundational BCI technologies is still an emerging area rather than a central research theme. On the other hand, ”machine learning” acts as a significant bridging node, connected to nearly all core technology areas, indicating its centrality and growing importance across the BCI-XR field. Our analysis indicates that Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were a frequently co-occurring ML method, often utilized for classification tasks based on extracted fea- tures. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) also appeared as an important ML-based technology, particularly relevant for visual data processing in applications involving HMDs or BCI signal analysis. Regarding emerging trends, while VR currently shows stronger and more established integration with BCI in this dataset (predominantly in rehabilitation), AR ex- hibits characteristics of a potent, growing area (Fig 4). Its dis- tinct clustering with technologies emphasizing portability and real-time interaction (such as wearable systems and SSVEP- based BCI) suggests an evolving trajectory. Although currently less intertwined with the core BCI-rehabilitation cluster than VR, AR’s role may expand significantly as portable BCI technology matures and new use cases beyond clinical settings become more prevalent. D. Future Directions Although the current framework does not incorporate ex- tensive domain knowledge during the training phase, testing it across diverse domains and comparing evaluation metrics remains a critical task. Additionally, curating a comprehensive list of technologies to augment the RAG setup could substan- tially improve the model’s precision. Therefore, future efforts should prioritize integrating such a thorough technology list into the model, followed by testing the framework in varied domains and a comparative analysis of the results.
