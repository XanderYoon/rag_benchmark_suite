extraction LLM. 2) LLM-based Candidate Technology Extraction : For the ini- tial candidate technology extraction, the RATE pipeline uti- lizes the DeepSeek-V3 model, accessed via its API endpoint [28]. Key generation parameters were set to ensure determin- istic and comprehensive output, including a temperature of 0.0 and max tokens set to 4096. This model is then prompted using a precisely engineered strategy for technology extraction with the objective of achieving maximum recall. It cautiously analyzes the primary input text to extract every single term or phrase that even remotely suggests a technology. Within this process, the LLM assigns each candidate a confidence score and includes the term if this score meets or exceeds a threshold of 0.7. While diverse contextual documents are provided via the RAG system, they serve strictly for back- ground understanding and disambiguation. As a result, all extracted technologies originate from the primary input text. This process aims to ensure that a comprehensive initial set of potential technologies are captured for subsequent refinement. 3) Intermediate Heuristic Validation : Following the initial candidate generation by the LLM, the RATE pipeline in- corporates an intermediate heuristic validation stage. first, a candidate is validated if its full phrase (case-insensitive), its base term (if the candidate contains a parenthesized acronym), or its potential acronym (if derivable from the candidate) is directly found within the input text. Second, for multi- word candidates, a partial compound match is accepted if a significant proportion ( ≥ 0.75) of its constituent meaningful words appear in the source text. Furthermore, candidates are provisionally retained if they were assigned a very high confidence score ( ≥ 0.95) by the initial LLM. As a final validation measure for candidates with at least moderate initial confidence (≥ 0.75) that did not meet the preceding criteria, their semantic similarity to
