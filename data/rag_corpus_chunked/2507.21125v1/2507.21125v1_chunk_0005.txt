with precision in prior automated technology recognition methods, due to the lack of annotated datasets, highlight the need for a more reliable and generalizable approach. Although modern LLMs and RAG systems precisely execute tasks, they do not inherently guarantee that extracted terms genuinely represent ” Technology” without validation against scholarly criteria. The crucial missing element is a tar- geted methodological framework for this rigorous definitional assessment. Therefore, a significant methodological gap exists for a systematic approach. Addressing this identified methodological gap, this paper introduces Retrieval Augmented Generation Technology Ex- traction (RATE), an automated pipeline designed for general- scale technology extraction from textual data. RATE employs a distinctive multi-stage process: it first utilizes an LLM pow- ered by RAG for comprehensive candidate technology identi- fication from scientific texts (abstracts, titles, and keywords). These candidates then undergo a novel validation phase where a second LLM critically evaluates each term against four dis- tinct, literature-derived definitions of technology, considering the full textual context from which the candidate originated. This study applies the RATE pipeline to a corpus of scientific literature focused on the intersection of AR, VR, and BCI. Our primary aims are to demonstrate the feasibility and effec- tiveness of this definition-driven, LLM-powered methodology in creating a granular and rigorously validated inventory of technologies, and subsequently, to provide initial insights into the technological landscape of the BCI-XR domain through co-occurrence analysis. II. M ETHODOLOGY A. Introduction to Methodology This study aims to develop and evaluate RATE, an auto- mated pipeline for extracting and validating technology terms from scientific literature, specifically focusing on publications at the intersection of AR, VR, and BCI. The proposed multi- stage methodology integrates LLMs with RAG for initial candidate identification, followed by a novel LLM-based val- idation process employing multiple scholarly definitions of technology.
