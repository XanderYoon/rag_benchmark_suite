develop and evaluate RATE, an auto- mated pipeline for extracting and validating technology terms from scientific literature, specifically focusing on publications at the intersection of AR, VR, and BCI. The proposed multi- stage methodology integrates LLMs with RAG for initial candidate identification, followed by a novel LLM-based val- idation process employing multiple scholarly definitions of technology. This approach was chosen for its potential to achieve high recall in candidate generation, enhance contextual understanding through RAG, and ensure high precision and conceptual rigor in the final validated list through its unique definitional validation step, addressing limitations of prior automated methods (Fig 1). B. Data Collection and Preprocessing The primary corpus for this study consists of data gathered from the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection. The search query was constructed in two main parts: the first part focused on AR and VR terms, and the second focused on BCI terms. These two parts were then combined using the ’AND’ operator of WoS to retrieve publications at the intersection of these fields. The search string for AR and VR, based on the work of Yeung et al. [4], was: TS= (” virtual realit*” OR ”augmented realit*” OR ”mixed realit*” OR ”computer-mediated realit*”) Text Pre-processing Data Collection WoS Query 2000-2024 Article and proceeding Initial Corpus LLM (CandidateGeneration) RAG RAG Knowledge Base LLM (DefinitionalValidation) Original Paper context Post-processing Extracted Technologies Heuristic validation rule-based andsemantic Fig. 1.
