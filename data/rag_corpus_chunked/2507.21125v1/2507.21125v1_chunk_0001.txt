I NTRODUCTION AND LITERATURE REVIEW The early 21st century has been an era of acceleration in the development of transformative digital technologies. Pow- ered by advancements in computing power, high-resolution displays, and artificial intelligence (AI), new ways of ex- periencing reality have emerged, most notably Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) [1]. AR enhances users’ perception of their real world environment by overlaying digital data onto their view [2], while VR immerses users in a completely artificial, computer generated reality [1], the umbrella term that brings these two immersive technologies together is called Extended Reality (XR) [3]. These immersive tools have found potent applications across diverse fields. In medicine, they help with diagnostics, surgi- * Corresponding author cal procedures, and rehabilitation programs [4]. Educational settings benefit from these technologies for training, inter- active teaching, and observational learning [5]. Furthermore, in industrial contexts, AR and VR serve as critical tools for maintenance, assembly guidance, and improving human-robot collaboration [6]. The efficacy of these applications often stems from the realistic and engaging experiences these tech- nologies provide. Such experiences can be significantly broad- ened and enriched by combining XR with Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) [7]. A BCI functions as a communication system that allows direct control of computers or external devices through neural activity alone [8]. In AR, BCIs offer a powerful method for real-time engagement with AR headsets, leading to applications such as hands-free manipulation of information by medical professionals, direct neural command of robotic devices, and help
