its specific textual context, qualifies as a technology or not. To enhance the understanding of the LLM from technology, four distinct, pre-defined scholarly definitions of technology based on the works of Puccetti et al. that were explicitly provided in its instructions [16]. The prompt further guides the LLM to focus its interpretation of these definitions on tangible, applied technical implementations, tools, systems, or methods, using specific ’YES if’ / ’NO if’ decision criteria. For every candidate, the LLM is required to return its assess- ment in a structured YAML format, which includes a Boolean field, indicating its textual reasoning for its decision, an integer confidence from 1 to 10 (based on detailed scoring rubrics provided to the LLM), and the technology name. A candidate technology phrase is ultimately confirmed and retained from this stage if the LLM returns Boolean field: true and assigns a confidence score greater than six. This step enhances the precision of the model significantly while maintaining the recall. While the results of this step are close to the final list of technologies within the specific paper, due to the nature of LLMs output some redundancies and different letter case variances for phrases were observed. This issue was addressed in the next step. 5) Post-Processing: Following the LLM-based definitional validation, the confirmed technology terms undergo a final series of post-processing steps. First, all validated terms are converted to lowercase, and exact duplicates are removed to ensure a unique set. This list is then checked against a user-defined, domain-specific list of prohibited or overly generic terms, allowing for user-defined exclusion of tech- nologies. Subsequently, an acronym-priority deduplication was performed to manage instances where both an acronym and its full expanded form exists, retaining the more concise version if they refer to the same base concept. The final remaining
