functionality within these rehabilitative applications. A second distinct cluster, labeled ” Portable AR-SSVEP Brain-Computer Interfaces for Real-Time Hands-Free Control”, centers around AR. This clus- ter’s co-occurrence with technologies like portable systems, wearable devices, real-time processing, and hands-free control suggests a different application focus for BCI-AR integration compared to BCI-VR. The relative separation of AR from the main rehabilitation-focused cluster in the network indicates its potential development towards daily-use and interactive control applications, often using paradigms like SSVEP. A third important cluster, named ” Head-Mounted Haptic Virtual Reality Interfaces with Physiological Feedback”, groups HMD technologies with haptic feedback systems and various phys- iological measurement techniques, including hemodynamic Fig. 4. Representation of technologies co-occurrence network with VOSviewer BCIs, heart-rate monitoring, and broader brain wave detection methods. This suggests a research thrust focused on creating richer, multi-sensory immersive experiences where BCI inputs are potentially augmented or correlated with other physiolog- ical signals to enhance interaction or user state assessment. C. Broader Network Insights and Emerging Trends The overall network structure and the prominence of certain nodes reinforce the observation that VR, BCI, and EEG form a well-established core in this research domain, particularly within a rehabilitation context. While our data included men- tions of non-EEG modalities like functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) and Magnetoencephalography (MEG), EEG clearly remains the dominant Neuroimaging technology in relation to BCI-XR applications found in the analyzed literature, likely due to its portability and cost-effectiveness. The relative peripheral position or weaker linkage of terms like ”Metaverse” to core EEG or AI hubs in the network might suggest that, within this specific corpus and timeframe (2000- 2024), its deep integration with foundational BCI technologies is still an emerging area rather than a central research theme. On the other hand, ”machine learning” acts as a significant bridging node, connected to nearly all
