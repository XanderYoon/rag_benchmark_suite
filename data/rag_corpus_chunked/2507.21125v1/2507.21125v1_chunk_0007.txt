The search string for BCI, based on the work of Yin et al. [21], was: TS= (” brain-computer interface *” OR ” brain- machine interface *” OR ” brain machine interface *” OR ”brain computer interface *” OR ”direct neural interface *”) Therefore, the final combined search string used in WoS was: TS= ((” virtual realit *” OR ” augmented realit *” OR ” mixed realit *” OR ” computer-mediated realit *”) AND (”brain-computer interface*” OR ”brain-machine interface*” OR ” brain machine interface *” OR ” brain computer inter- face*” OR ”direct neural interface *”)) To refine the search results, the publication years were restricted to 2000–2024, and document types were limited to ”proceeding” and ”article”. Furthermore, the language was set to English only. This search strategy yielded 678 publications as of the 23rd of May 2025. For each of these publications bibliographic data including Abstract, Title, publication year, and author keywords were extracted. The extracted Title, Abstract, and Author Keywords for each publication were then concatenated to form a single comprehensive text document representing that publication. This combined text served as the primary input for the subsequent technology extraction process. In the final pre-processing step a dedicated function was used to standardize the format of the text document by removing excessive whitespaces. C. RATE Pipeline 1) RAG Setup: The initial stage of the RATE pipeline es- tablishes a RAG system designed to provide the primary tech- nology extraction LLM with relevant contextual documents. resulting in domain understanding and term disambiguation for the LLM. RAG’s knowledge base is constructed by consolidat- ing diverse public technology lists, including Wikipedia’s list of emerging technologies (drawing on insights from Puccetti et al. [16]), the Chinese catalogue of prohibited and restricted technologies (based on CSET [22]), the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) list of clean
