supervised Machine Learning tech- niques such as BERT. Its success comes from an innovative multi-stage design. Initially, one LLM with RAG identifies a broad set of potential technology candidates. Then, cru- cially, a second LLM validates these candidates by assessing them against four distinct scholarly definitions of technology directly within their original textual context. This unique, definition-driven validation step significantly improves preci- sion and helps overcome the common challenge of technol- ogy’s ambiguous nature. RATE thus offers a robust approach for accurately mapping technological landscapes, reducing the reliance on extensive pre-annotated datasets often required by other methods. As a result, a novel method to detect technologies without requiring extensive field knowledge or annotated data had been proposed. brain computer interfacevirtual realityelectroencephalographyaugmented realitymotor imagerysteady state visual evoked potentialmachine learningroboticssupport vector machineneurofeedback wearablefeature extractioneye tracking artificial intelligence head mounted displayevent related desynchronizationdeep learning p300 event related potential electromyography virtual reality headsetcanonical correlation analysisevent related potentialscommon spatial patternslinear discriminant analysisconvolutional neural network extended reality mixed reality emotion recognition signal processingelectroencephalography-based brain-computer interfacehybrid brain computer interface internet of thingsmetaverse electrooculogram augmented reality glasses affective computing steady-state visual evoked potential brain-computer interface classifiers dry electrodes biofeedback information transfer rate functional magnetic resonance imagingmotor imagery brain computer interface random forest electroencephalography signals brain-computer interface virtual reality classification kinesthetic motor imageryscalp electroencephalographyclosed loop brain computer interfacebrain modeling functional electrical stimulation computer vision virtual reality game fast fourier transform microsoft hololens p300 event-related potential exoskeleton augmented reality headset non invasive brain stimulation ar ssvep exoskeletons principal component analysis asynchronous brain-computer interface power spectral density virtual reality driving simulator discrete wavelet transform solid modeling power spectrumwireless openvibe functional near infrared spectroscopy artificial neural networks signal to noise ratio blood volume pulseelectrodermal activity p300 event-related potential brain-computer interface asynchronous control eegnet transfer learning leave one subject out cross validation heart
