technologies included Mo- tor Imagery (MI) (14.18% corpus frequency), Steady State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) (6.06%), Machine Learning (ML) (5.32%), Neurofeedback (5.17%), eye tracking tech- nologies (3.84%), P300 (2.95%), and Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) (2.66%). C. Technology mapping using co-occurrence networks The resulting technology co-occurrence network, initially consisted of 3181 nodes (representing unique technologies) and 23465 edges (representing co-occurrence of technologies). However, analyzing and visualizing such a large network typically results in a confusing representation. Therefore, to improve clarity and focus on more significant relationships, nodes with a weighted degree of less than 10 were removed. This filtering process resulted in a final primary network of 1260 nodes and 11610 edges (Table I). This refined network were then created and analyzed with the help of Gephi, a prominent network creation and analyzing tool. The resulting network exhibited an average weighted degree of 23.041, a network diameter of 3 (indicating relatively short paths between any two technologies), and a graph density of 0.015. It showed a high propensity for local clustering with an average clustering coefficient of 0.912, and the average path length of 2.066. The entire filtered network comprised a single connected component. Community structure within this refined network was further investigated using two distinct algorithms. First, by applying the Louvain method a modu- larity score of 0.395 had been calculated. Second, the Girvan- Newman algorithm was also applied. This method identified 112 distinct communities and achieved a maximum modularity score of 0.44 (Fig 2). These metrics collectively describe the topological characteristics and the nuanced community organization of the refined technology co-occurrence network. These specific values and their implications for the BCI-XR field were detailed further in the Discussion section. the most prominent cluster based on Girvan-Newman consisted of 385 technologies, many of the most important technologies of the field (Highest
