(FP), and False Negatives (FN) of both models. Consequently, precision, recall, and F1-score were calculated for RATE and BERT. Calculated precision, recall, and F1-score for BERT were 39.16%, 85.50%, and 53.73% respectively. While the results for RATE were significantly superior with 94.26% precision, 88.47% recall, and 91.27% F1-score. RATE’s superior F1- score highlights its effectiveness in balancing high precision with strong recall, without requiring annotated training data. To the best of our knowledge, this F1-score represents a state-of-the-art performance for technology extraction in a general context from scientific literature, particularly in zero- shot settings. B. Descriptive Statistics of Extracted Technologies The RATE pipeline was applied to the entire corpus of 678 scientific papers focusing on the intersection of XR and BCI, published between 2000 and 2024. This comprehensive analysis identified and validated a total of 3,181 unique tech- nology terms across all documents. Regarding the distribution of technologies per paper, the most frequently occurring counts of unique technologies were 8 (observed in 78 papers), 7 (in 76 papers), and 9 (in 75 papers). On average, each paper contained 8.8 unique technology terms, with a standard devi- ation of 3.4. The number of unique technologies identified in a single paper ranged from a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 23. Analysis of corpus frequency revealed that the most widely observed technologies were BCI at 71.64%, VR at 50.66%, Electroencephalography (EEG) at 43.13%, and AR at 17.73%. Other notable frequently occurring technologies included Mo- tor Imagery (MI) (14.18% corpus frequency), Steady State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) (6.06%), Machine Learning (ML) (5.32%), Neurofeedback (5.17%), eye tracking tech- nologies (3.84%), P300 (2.95%), and Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) (2.66%). C. Technology mapping using co-occurrence networks The resulting technology co-occurrence network, initially consisted of 3181 nodes (representing unique technologies) and 23465 edges (representing co-occurrence of technologies).
