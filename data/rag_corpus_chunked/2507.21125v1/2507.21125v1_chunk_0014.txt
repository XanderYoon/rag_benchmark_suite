conducted using the Trainer API with the fol- lowing hyperparameters: 20 epochs, batch size of 16, learning rate of 2e-5, AdamW optimizer with weight decay of 0.01, and early stopping based on F1-score on the validation set. Evaluation metrics included token-level accuracy and entity- level F1-score, accounting for partial matches in multi-word entities. This BERT baseline was trained on a GPU-enabled environment, achieving convergence after 15 epochs. Post- training, the model was used to predict technology entities on unseen test texts by aggregating B-TECH and I-TECH tokens into phrases, filtering out single-token noise through post-processing. F . Technology Mapping and Co-occurrence Analysis Following the extraction and validation of technology terms by the RATE pipeline for each of the 678 scientific papers, a co-occurrence analysis was conducted to map and visualize the relational structure of these technologies within the BCI-XR research domain. This analysis aimed to identify prominent technologies, understand their interconnections, and reveal underlying thematic groupings. Two technologies were consid- ered to co-occur if they both appeared in the final validated list of extracted technologies for the same scientific paper. This co- occurrence data was used to construct a network where each unique validated technology represents a node, and an edge between two nodes signifies that the technologies co-occurred. The weight of each edge was determined by the frequency of co-occurrence across the entire corpus of 678 papers. The co-occurrence network was constructed using custom Python scripts leveraging the Pandas library [32] for reading the processed Excel data and the NetworkX library for graph creation and manipulation [33]. Nodes with low edge wight were removed ( < 10) for better readability, then the average weighted degree, indicating the average sum of co-occurrence frequencies for each technology node, was calculated. The network diameter, defined as the longest shortest path between any
