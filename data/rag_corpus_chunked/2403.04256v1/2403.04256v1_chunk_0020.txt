in LLMs, thus enjoying a more compre- hensive understanding of user preferences. 5.3 Sensitivity Analysis In this section, we conduct a sensitivity analysis w.r.t. α in Equation 63. This is a key factor affect- ing the hybrid retrieval before LLM. In particular, we change it from 0 to 1 and keep other configura- tions the same. The results are shown in Figure 4. We observe that the balance between ID-based re- trieval and text-based retrieval play an important role in terms of hybrid retrieval. As shown in Fig- ure 4, there exists an optimal α between 0 and 1 for different datasets respectively, indicating the necessity of hybrid retrieval in GPT-FedRec. 3Due to the limit budget of calling GPT API, we only perform sensitivity analysis for the first stage of GPT-FedRec.

We mask out different com- ponents of GPT-FedRec separately, and evaluate the recommendation performance. 5.4 Ablation Study Finally, we conduct an ablation study to evalu- ate the contribution of each key module of GPT- FedRec, namely the hybrid retrieval in the first stage and the LLM-based re-ranking in the second stage. The results are reported in Table 2. In Ta- ble 2, w/o LRU refers to GPT-FedRec only with E5 as retriever in the first stage, and w/o E5 indicates that there is only LRURec in the first stage. w/o LLM represents GPT-FedRec without the LLM- based re-rank. As expected, we observe that both hybrid retrieval and LLM-based re-ranking con- tributes to a better recommendation
