Such regulations limit the development of modern recommendation systems. To address this issue, federated recommenda- tion (FR) emerges as a new paradigm facilitating privacy-preserving recommendations (Ammad-Ud- Din et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2024). In FR, a cen- tral server stores a global recommendation model, while a set of clients contain local private data. These clients collaboratively train the global model without sharing their private data. Note that the concept "client" does not necessarily refer to a sin- gle human user, but can also represent a local data server with a small dataset. For clarity, we con- sistently use "client" to represent a federated client, and use "user" to denote a human user of a recommender system. However, traditional FR systems usually rep- resent users/items with discrete identities (Zhang et al., 2024). As such, they may suffer from de- graded performance, due to the data sparsity and heterogeneity in the federated setting (Wu et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2024). In FR, the clients might only contain the data of a few or even a single user (data sparsity). Training an ID-based recommender on such sparse data is prone to overfitting (Zhang 1General Data Protection
