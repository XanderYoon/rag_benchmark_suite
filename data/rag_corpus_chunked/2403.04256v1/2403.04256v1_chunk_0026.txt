A Implementation Details A.1 Datasets Details and FR Setup Overall Dataset Statistics. The detailed dataset statistics (after 5-core processing) is reported in Table 3. According to Table 3, it is observed that the averaged sequence length in ML-100K is significantly larger than that of other datasets. In addition, the density of ML-100K is also much higher than others. Finally, the Beauty, Games, Toys and Auto datasets are all Amazon review datasets, whose domain is rather different from that of ML-100K.
