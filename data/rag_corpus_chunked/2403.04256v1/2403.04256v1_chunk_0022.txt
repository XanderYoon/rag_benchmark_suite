one might need to finetune these hy- perparameters, which brings extra computational cost. Another limitation of this work is that our method does not take the inherent bias of GPT into account. However, it is known that such pretrained LLMs usually have encoded the bias in the pre- training data (e.g., stereotypical data, racism and hate speech). Such bias could have negative ethical implications on the downstream FR applications. Therefore, a future research direction is to develop a benign and fair FR framework.
