with gated neural atten- tion for person search. Niu et al. [32] designed a multi-granularity image-text alignments model for better modeling the similarity between text description and person images. In [9], Guo et al. intro- duced the reinforcement learning techniques to the task of dialog- based interactive image search that enables users to provide feed- back via natural language. 3 THE PROPOSED APPROACH This paper proposes to tackle the content-based complex-query video retrieval task, in which the query is a natural language sen- tence that describes a video. We basically follow the embedding- based paradigm that embeds the queries and videos into a joint embedding space where texts and videos can be easily matched and ranked. In this section, we first introduce an approach to recur- sively compose a latent semantic tree to model the complex query in Section 3.1. Then we introduce how to obtain the vector repre- sentations of the query and videos in Section 3.2 and 3.3, followed by the joint optimization of the query and video embeddings in the same space in Section 3.4. 3.1 LST: Latent Semantic Tree To better understand the complex query, this work proposes to use the Tree-structured LSTM (TreeLSTM) [39] to recursively compose a latent semantic tree (LST) in a bottom-to-up fashion to struc- turally describe each given query. Following [4], the LST structure is formulated as a binary recursive tree with two kinds of nodes: leaf nodes (i.e., words) and parent nodes (i.e., constituents). A parent node takes in two adjacent child nodes and describes more com- plex semantics than its child nodes. In this section, we first briefly describe how to apply TreeLSTM to compute the parent node repre- sentation from its two child nodes and then describe how to select the parent node at each layer for recursively
