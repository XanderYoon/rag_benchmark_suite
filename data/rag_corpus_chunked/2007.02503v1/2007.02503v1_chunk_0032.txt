The composed latent semantic trees are presented under the corresponding queries. The normalized node weights are also shown. Videos with red marks are the correct ones. being played followed by a basketball team playing on a court ” is more complex than the query “a music video ”. Hence, the results validates that our proposed TCE is better in handling the complex queries, mainly benefiting from the latent semantic tree. In Figure 3(b), the performance in different query categories varies greatly, showing the varying difficulty of queries in different categories. For instance, the performance on the query group of sports/actions is higher than 0.25, while only about 0.13 on the query group of news/politics. The observation is reasonable since the sports/actions scenes are easy to be visually distinguished, while the news/politics scenes are much more diverse, and it is hard to learn the relation between news words and the visual scenes with limited training data. Despite the varied difficulty for each group, our proposed TCE model consistently beats the baseline on all groups. 4.2.4 Qualitative Analysis.
