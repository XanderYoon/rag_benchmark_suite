and modeled the word dependency based on a series of manually derived rules. In [45], Xu et al. constructed the dependency-tree structure based on subject-verb-object triplets extracted from a sentence and modeled the structure by a recursive neural network. For video embedding, a typical approach is to first extract the frame-level features by pre-trained CNNs and subsequently ag- gregate them into a video representation. To obtain the video- level feature, mean pooling and max pooling are common choices [6, 28, 30, 45]. Yu et al. [51] used LSTM to model the temporal infor- mation, where frame-level features are sequentially fed into LSTM, and the hidden vector at the last step is used as the video feature. Dong et al. [7] also explicitly exploited the global and local patterns in videos to obtain a multi-level video representation. In this work, we design a temporal attentive video encoder that jointly models the temporal dependence between consecutive frames by RNNs and frame-wise temporal interaction by using the multi-head attention mechanism. Natural language query-based retrieval techniques have also been successfully applied for domain-specific object retrieval in the filed of video surveillance or E-commerce, such as text-based person search [19] and its application in person re-identification [32, 46, 47] and dialog-based fashion retrieval [ 9]. In [19], Li et al. collected a large-scale person description dataset with detailed natural lan- guage annotations and person samples from various sources and proposed a novel recurrent neural network with gated neural atten- tion for person search. Niu et al. [32] designed a multi-granularity image-text alignments model for better modeling the similarity between text description and person images. In [9], Guo et al. intro- duced the reinforcement learning techniques to the task of dialog- based interactive image search that enables users to provide feed- back via natural language. 3
