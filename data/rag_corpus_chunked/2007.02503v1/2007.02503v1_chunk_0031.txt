Figure 3: Performance comparison of DualGRU and our proposed TCE on MSR-VTT. Queries have been grouped in terms of (a) query lengths and (b) query categories. in each group by query lengths and categories are shown in Fig- ure 3(a) and 3(b), respectively. In Figure 3(a), our proposed TCE consistently outperforms the DualGRU in all groups with different query lengths, showing its effectiveness in complex query modeling. Especially, we clearly observe that with increasing query lengths (from left to right in Figure 3(a)), the performance gain of TCE over DualGRU becomes much more significant. Generally, the longer queries are more complex than the shorter queries.
