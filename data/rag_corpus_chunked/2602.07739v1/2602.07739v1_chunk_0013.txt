the Lorentz factors.We define a radius-dependent weighting function ϕ(xi) =x p i,0, p >0, which is monotone in the radial coordinate. The Outward Einstein Midpoint is then given by mOEM K,p = Pn i=1 (wi ϕ(xi))λ ixiPn i=1 (wi ϕ(xi))λ i , followed by reprojection onto the hyperboloidH d K. As shown in Figure 3, by construction, this operator assigns disproportionately higher weight to tokens located farther from the origin, counteracting the contraction inherent to naïve averaging. We now establish theoretical guarantees for the Outward Einstein Midpoint, showing that it system- atically improves upon the standard Einstein midpoint in preserving radial structure. Theorem 4.6(OEM Pre-Projection Bound).Let ˜v=Pn i=1 ˜wixi where ˜wi ∝w ixp+1 i,0 are the normalized OEM weights. Then, forp≥0, we have ˜v0 = Pn i=1 wixp+2 i,0 Pn i=1 wixp+1 i,0 ≥ Pn i=1 wixi,0Pn i=1 wi = ¯rw. We apply Chebyshev’s sum inequality to the co-monotonic sequences ai =x p+1 i,0 and bi =x i,0 to prove this. Full proof can be found in Appendix A.4. While projection onto Hd K contracts the radial coordinate, the OEM’s concentration of weight on high-radius tokens inflates the pre-projection average, counteracting this effect. Theorem 4.6 establishes that OEM increases the pre-projection radial coordinate. The following theorem shows a stronger result: OEM prov- ably dominates the standard Einstein midpoint in preserving radial structure. Theorem 4.7(OEM Outward Bias).Let mEin K denote the standard Einstein midpoint (p= 0 ) and mOEM K,p the Outward Einstein Midpoint. Then, for allp≥1: r(mOEM K,p )≥r(m Ein K ). The OEM weights ˜wi ∝w ixp+1 i,0 concentrate more mass on high-radius points than the Einstein weights wixi,0, in- creasing the pre-projection time component while reducing pairwise dispersion. Full proof in Appendix A.5. Together, these results establish that the Outward Einstein Midpoint provably preserves hierarchical structure during aggregation,
