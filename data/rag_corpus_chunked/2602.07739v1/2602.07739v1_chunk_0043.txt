describing the Bixby guide: “When you press the button for the first time, the Using Bixby button appears... a tutorial on using Bixby is shown. ”This enables a concise, accurate response: “The feature of Bixby guide is a tutorial on using Bixby, which is shown when you press the button on your Samsung Smart Remote after the first time, and then press the Select button. ” (2) Retrieval Collapse with Honest Refusal (GTE).GTE retrieves its default “hub” documents—generic content about picture quality, SmartThings, and antenna connections—regardless of the query. The LLM correctly identifies the context mismatch: “Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the Bixby guide. ” A7 HypRAG Table A4.Case study metrics for the query“What is the feature of Bixby guide?”CR = Context Relevance, F = Faithfulness, AR = Answer Relevancy. Model CR F AR Failure Mode HyTE-H1.0 1.0 1.0None (Success) GTE 0.5 1.0 0.0 Honest Refusal Gemma 1.0 0.25 0.94 Ungrounded Extrapolation While this response is faithful (F=1.0), it provides no utility (AR=0.0). This pattern, where Euclidean embeddings collapse to retrieving the same generic documents, occurred for 100% of queries in GTE’s results. (3) Partial Context with Topic Drift (Gemma).Gemma retrieves tangentially related content about the Samsung Smart Remote that mentions Bixby but not the Bixbyguide. The LLM provides information about running Bixby generally rather than the guide feature: “Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the Bixby guide. However, based on general knowledge, the Bixby guide is a feature in Samsung TVs that provides users with a personalized interface to access various features and settings. It offers a simplified and intuitive way to navigate the TV’s menu... ” This response achieveshighanswer relevancy (AR=0.94) because it sounds plausible, butlowfaithfulness (F=0.25) because the claims are fabricated. This “confident hallucination” failure mode is particularly dangerous: users receive authoritative-sounding misinformation. JSON
