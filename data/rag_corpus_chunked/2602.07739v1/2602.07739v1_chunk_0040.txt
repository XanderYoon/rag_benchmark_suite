in-batch negatives of sizeN requires O(N 2d) per batch, matching the complexity of standard contrastive learning. Supervised contrastive fine-tuning has the same asymptotic cost. Masked language modeling introduces no additional asymptotic overhead beyond the encoder forward pass. Retrieval and RAG Inference.At inference time, dense retrieval over a corpus of size |D| requires computing hyperbolic distances between a query embedding and document embeddings, with total cost O(|D|d) . This matches Euclidean dense retrieval up to constant factors. Approximate nearest neighbor indexing can be applied without modification, as retrieval relies only on pairwise distance computations. In summary, the proposed hyperbolic dense retrieval system has the same asymptotic computational complexity as a Euclidean transformer-based retriever: O(L(n2d+nd 2)) for encoding, and O(|D|d) for retrieval. The additional cost of hyperbolic geometry manifests only as constant-factor overhead from Lorentzian inner products and reprojection, while enabling geometry-aware modeling of hierarchical structure. E. Additional results Full MTEB Results.Table A1 presents the performance of our proposed models on the MTEB benchmark across seven task types. All models share the same architecture with 149M parameters, 768 dimensions, and 12 layers. HyTE-H achieves the best overall performance with a Mean (Task) score of 59.89, outperforming both HyTE-FH and the Euclidean baselines. Notably, HyTE-H ranks first in six out of seven task categories, demonstrating the effectiveness of the hybrid hyperbolic-Euclidean approach. HyTE-FH shows competitive performance in clustering tasks, securing second place, which suggests that hyperbolic geometry is particularly beneficial for capturing hierarchical relationships. The Euclidean equivalent (ModernBert-embed*) achieves second place in most categories but falls short of HyTE-H, indicating that incorporating hyperbolic components provides meaningful improvements over purely Euclidean representations.
