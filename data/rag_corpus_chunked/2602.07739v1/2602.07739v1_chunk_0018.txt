Implementation.We implement all hyperbolic models using HyperCore (He et al., 2025e) and train on NVIDIA H100 GPUs. All three models, HyTE-FH, HyTE-H, and Eu- cBERT, share the same architecture, each containing 149M parameters with 12 transformer layers and 768-dimensional embeddings. For generation and judging, we use Llama- 3.1-8B-Instruct (Weerawardhena et al., 2025). For RAG benchmarks, we fix the retrieval context window size to 5 for all models to ensure a controlled comparison; we additionally report ablations with larger context sizes in Appendix Table A3. 5.2. Results MTEB Benchmark.Table 1 reports performance on the MTEB benchmark. HyTE-FH achieves the highest mean score across tasks (56.41), outperforming both EucBERT (54.11) and HyTE-HEuc (54.57). On the task-type mean, HyTE-FH and HyTE-HEuc perform comparably (53.75 and 53.71, respectively), with both surpassing EucBERT (51.31). These results demonstrate that hyperbolic representations not only improve RAG retrieval but also remain competitive on general-purpose embedding benchmarks. We present task-wise results in Table A1. RAG Benchmark Results.Table 2 presents RAG bench- mark results across five datasets. HyTE-FH achieves the best average performance across all three metrics: faithful- ness (0.732), context relevance (0.848), and answer rele-
