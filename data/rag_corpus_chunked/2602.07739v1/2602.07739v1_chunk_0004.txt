introduce the Outward Einstein Midpoint, a geometry-aware pooling operator that amplifies tokens farther from the origin, provably preserving hierarchical structure during pooling. Through extensive evaluation on RAGBench, we demon- strate that both hyperbolic variants consistently outper- form Euclidean baselines in answer relevancy across multi- ple datasets, while achieving competitive performance on MTEB. Our experiments validate three key findings: (1) hy- perbolic retrieval substantially improves RAG performance, with up to 29% gains over Euclidean baselines in context relevance and answer relevance; (2) hyperbolic models nat- urally encode concept-level hierarchies in their radial struc- ture, with the fully hyperbolic model achieving a 20.2% radius increase from general to specific concepts, while Eu- clidean models fail to capture this organization; and (3) our theoretically grounded Outward Einstein Midpoint pooling preserves this hierarchical structure during aggregation. 2. Related Works Text Embeddings and Dense Retrieval.Dense retrieval embeds queries and documents into a shared vector space and ranks candidates by similarity (e.g., dot product or co- sine). Transformer bi-encoders (e.g., BERT (Devlin et al., 2019)) are widely used in this context due to their scalabil- ity with maximum inner product search (Karpukhin et al., 2020; Reimers & Gurevych, 2019). Most methods train with contrastive objectives using in-batch and hard negatives (Gao et al., 2021; Izacard et al., 2021; Xiong et al., 2021), often following large-scale pretraining plus task-specific fine-tuning (Wang et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Nussbaum et al., 2025). More recently, decoder-only embedding mod- els initialize from LLMs to exploit their pretrained linguis- tic knowledge (Muennighoff et al., 2024; Lee et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2025). However, most retrievers remain reliant on inner products or distances in Euclidean geometry-an in- ductive bias often misaligned with the hierarchical structure of language and document collections. We address this gap by introducing hyperbolic geometry for text
