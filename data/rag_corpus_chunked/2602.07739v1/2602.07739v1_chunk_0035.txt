i,0 ≥ P i wixi,0P i wi . The left-hand side equals ˜v0 and the right-hand side equals ¯rw, completing the proof. Equality holds if and only if all xi,0 are identical. 2 A.5. Proof of Theorem 4.7 Theorem A.5(OEM Outward Bias).Let mEin K denote the standard Einstein midpoint (p= 0 ) and mOEM K,p the Outward Einstein Midpoint. Then for allp≥1: r(mOEM K,p )≥r(m Ein K ). Proof.For a general exponentq≥0, define the weighted average with weights proportional tow ixq+1 i,0 : v(q) = P i wixq+1 i,0 xi P i wixq+1 i,0 . The projected point ism (q) = ΠK(v(q))with radial depth: r(m(q)) = v(q) 0p K⟨v (q),v (q)⟩L . The Einstein midpoint corresponds toq= 0and the OEM toq=p. We show that q7→r(m (q)) is non-decreasing for q≥0 . Define the normalized weights α(q) i =w ixq+1 i,0 /P j wjxq+1 j,0 . As q increases, these weights concentrate toward indices with largerx i,0: ifx i,0 > x j,0, then α(q) i α(q) j = wi wj  xi,0 xj,0 q+1 is strictly increasing inq. A3 HypRAG The radial depth after projection satisfies: r(m(q))2 = (v(q) 0 )2 K⟨v (q),v (q)⟩L . We analyze numerator and denominator separately. Numerator:We havev (q) 0 =P i α(q) i xi,0. By Chebyshev’s inequality (Theorem 4.6), this is non-decreasing inq. Denominator:We have K⟨v (q),v (q)⟩L = X i,j α(q) i α(q) j K⟨x i,x j⟩L. By Lemma A.1, K⟨x i,x j⟩L ≥1 with equality iff xi =x j. As weights concentrate on fewer points (larger q), the sum decreases toward 1. Thus as q increases: the numerator (v(q) 0 )2 increases, while the denominator K⟨v (q),v (q)⟩L decreases. Both effects increase r(m(q))2, establishing monotonicity. Forp≥1>0, we concluder(m OEM K,p ) =r(m (p))≥r(m (0)) =r(m Ein K ).2 B. RAG Prompt For each
