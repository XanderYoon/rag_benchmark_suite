Euclidean spaces distort such hierarchies due to crowding effects, while hyperbolic geometry preserves hierar- chical relationships through exponential volume growth. (B) Ricci curvature analysis of document embeddings from strong baselines reveals predominantly negative curvature, indicating tree-like se- mantic structure. et al., 2024), where embedding quality directly determines whether generated responses are grounded in evidence or hallucinated. By retrieving relevant documents and condi- tioning generation on this context, RAG systems produce responses that are more attributable and aligned with ver- ifiable sources (Ni et al., 2025). Yet, despite advances in retrieval architectures, current systems continue to rely on Euclidean embeddings, a choice inherited from standard neural networks rather than from language structure itself. Natural language inherently exhibits strong hierarchical or- ganization (He et al., 2025b; Robinson et al., 2024), with semantic structure giving rise to locally tree-like neigh- borhoods. Euclidean spaces struggle to represent such branching hierarchies due to polynomial volume growth (He et al., 2025b), introducing shortcuts between hierarchically distinct regions that distort semantic relationships. In re- trieval settings, these distortions can cause semantically dis- tant documents to appear spuriously similar (Radovanovic et al., 2010; Bogolin et al., 2022), degrading retrieval preci- sion (Reimers & Gurevych, 2021): a query about a specific subtopic may retrieve documents from sibling or parent cat- egories that share similarity but lack the required specificity. To further see why geometry matters for retrieval, consider a query about transformer attention mechanisms (Figure 1A). Relevant documents form a natural hierarchy—from general concepts
