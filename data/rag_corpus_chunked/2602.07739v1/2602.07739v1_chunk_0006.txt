generation (Liu et al., 2019), recommendation (Yang et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021), im- age retrieval (Khrulkov et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2024; Bui et al., 2025), and knowledge graph embedding (Ganea et al., 2018a; Dhingra et al., 2018). More recently, hyperbolic ge- ometry has also shown promise for multi-modal embedding models (Desai et al., 2023; Ibrahimi et al., 2024; Pal et al., 2024) and foundation models (Yang et al., 2025; He et al., 2025a). In contrast to these works, we study how hyper- bolic representations can improve retrieval in RAG systems. Concurrently, Cao et al. (2025) use hyperbolic geometry to improve RAG rankings, but obtain hyperbolic embed- dings via a simple projection from Euclidean encoders; by contrast, we build on fully hyperbolic encoders trained end- to-end and address key challenges in this setting, including providing the theoretically grounded geometry-aware pool- ing for document-level representations. 3. Hyperbolic Space Preliminaries In this section, we go over all the preliminaries of Lorentz model of hyperbolic space and introduce the basic building blocks that create HyTE-FH. 3.1. Lorentz Model of Hyperbolic Space We represent all embeddings in d-dimensional hyperbolic space Hd K with constant negative curvature K <0 using the Lorentz (hyperboloid) model. In the Lorentz model, hyperbolic space is realized as the upper sheet of a two- sheeted hyperboloid embedded inR d+1, Hd K =  x∈R d+1 ⟨x,x⟩ L = 1 K , x 0 >0  , where the Lorentzian inner product is defined as ⟨x,y⟩ L = −x0y0 +Pd i=1 xiyi. This formulation admits closed-form expressions for geodesic distances, barycentric operations, and parallel transport, and expresses similarity directly through Lorentzian inner products. The geodesic distance between two points x,y∈H d K is given by dK(x,y) = 1√−K cosh−1(K⟨x,y⟩ L), which is a monotone function of the Lorentzian
