relationships. The Euclidean equivalent (ModernBert-embed*) achieves second place in most categories but falls short of HyTE-H, indicating that incorporating hyperbolic components provides meaningful improvements over purely Euclidean representations.

While the Lorentz inner product provides a computationally convenient similarity A6 HypRAG measure, geodesic distance directly reflects intrinsic distances on the manifold. As shown in Table A2, using geodesic distance in the contrastive objective leads to improved performance across both mean task and mean task-type metrics, suggesting more effective alignment of representations in hyperbolic space. Table A2.Comparison of loss functions for hyperbolic embeddings. Both Lorentz inner product and geodesic distance are evaluated for their effectiveness in learning hierarchical representations.

The Euclidean baseline (Gemma) exhibits a large performance gain across all metrics with the larger context window, but still falls short of the fully hyperbolic HyTE-H model. HyTE-FH also improves with increased context, while HyTE-H remains comparatively stable, achieving consistently strong performance at both context sizes. This suggests that fully hyperbolic retrieval is less sensitive to context expansion and maintains effectiveness even under smaller retrieval budgets. Table A3.Average performance on
