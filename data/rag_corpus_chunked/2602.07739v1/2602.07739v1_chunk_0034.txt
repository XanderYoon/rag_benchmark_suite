factor growth is: Vol(Bρ) λ ∼ exp((d−1) √ −K ρ) exp( √ −K ρ) = exp((d−2) √ −K ρ). For d≥3 , this ratio diverges as ρ→ ∞ , demonstrating that the Lorentz factor provides insufficient compensation for the exponential growth of hyperbolic space at large radii.2 A.4. Proof of Theorem 4.6 Theorem A.4(OEM Pre-Projection Bound).Let ˜v= Pn i=1 ˜wixi where ˜wi ∝w ixp+1 i,0 are the normalized OEM weights. Then, forp≥0: ˜v0 = Pn i=1 wixp+2 i,0 Pn i=1 wixp+1 i,0 ≥ Pn i=1 wixi,0Pn i=1 wi = ¯rw. A2 HypRAG Proof.We apply Chebyshev’s sum inequality. Define sequences: ai =x p+1 i,0 , b i =x i,0. Since xi,0 >0 for all i (points lie on the upper sheet of the hyperboloid) and p≥0 , both sequences are strictly positive. Moreover, the sequences are co-monotonic: for anyi, j, xi,0 ≥x j,0 ⇐ ⇒x p+1 i,0 ≥x p+1 j,0 , sincet7→t p+1 is strictly increasing on(0,∞). Chebyshev’s sum inequality states that for co-monotonic sequences {ai}, {bi} and non-negative weights {wi} withP i wi >0: X i wiaibi ! X i wi ! ≥ X i wiai ! X i wibi ! . Substitutinga i =x p+1 i,0 andb i =x i,0: X i wixp+2 i,0 ! X i wi ! ≥ X i wixp+1 i,0 ! X i wixi,0 ! . Dividing both sides by P i wixp+1 i,0  (P i wi)>0: P i wixp+2 i,0 P i wixp+1 i,0 ≥ P i wixi,0P i wi . The left-hand side equals ˜v0 and the right-hand side equals ¯rw, completing the proof. Equality holds if and only if all xi,0 are identical. 2 A.5. Proof of Theorem 4.7 Theorem A.5(OEM Outward Bias).Let mEin K denote the standard Einstein midpoint (p= 0 ) and mOEM K,p the Outward Einstein Midpoint. Then
