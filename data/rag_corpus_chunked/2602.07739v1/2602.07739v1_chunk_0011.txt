larger radii. This provides a measurable signature for evaluating whether models learn meaningful hierarchical structure. The simplest aggregation strategy is Euclidean averaging in the ambient space followed by reprojection. However, this approach provably contracts rep- resentations toward the origin (Ganea et al., 2018a; Chami et al., 2019), destroying hierarchical structure encoded in radial depth. We formalize this in the following proposition. Proposition 4.3(Euclidean Mean Contracts).Let {xi}n i=1 ⊂H d K with n≥2 . Define the Euclidean mean ¯x= 1 n Pn i=1 xi and its projection onto the hyperboloid mEuc = ΠK(¯x). Then, we have r(mEuc)≤ 1 n nX i=1 r(xi), with equality if and only if allx i are identical. 4 HypRAG Figure 3.Outward Einstein Midpoint. Size of token shows its contribution towards aggregation. The proof of this Proposition is available in Appendix A.2. This failure motivates a precise characterization of desirable pooling behavior. We formalize the requirement that pooling should preserve, rather than collapse, radial structure. Definition 4.4(Outward Bias).A pooling operator P: (Hd K)n →H d K isoutward-biasedif r(P({x i}n i=1))≥¯r , where¯ris the weighted mean radius. A natural alternative is a weighted aggregation scheme in which token contributions are modulated by their relative im- portance. For example, Zhu et al. (2020) adopt the Einstein midpoint, the canonical barycenter in hyperbolic space (Gul- cehre et al., 2019), to emphasize semantically specific to- kens during pooling: since points near the boundary receive higher weight via the Lorentz factor λi =x i,0, more infor- mative content should dominate the aggregate. However, we show this intuition is misleading: the implicit radial weight- ing is fundamentally insufficient to counteract hyperbolic contraction at the document level. Proposition 4.5(Implicit Radial Weighting is Insufficient). The Einstein midpoint weights points by the Lorentz factor λi =x i,0, but this weighting grows as exp( √ −Kρ) while
