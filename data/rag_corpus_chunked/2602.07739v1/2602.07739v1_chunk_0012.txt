=x i,0, more infor- mative content should dominate the aggregate. However, we show this intuition is misleading: the implicit radial weight- ing is fundamentally insufficient to counteract hyperbolic contraction at the document level. Proposition 4.5(Implicit Radial Weighting is Insufficient). The Einstein midpoint weights points by the Lorentz factor λi =x i,0, but this weighting grows as exp( √ −Kρ) while hyperbolic volume grows as exp((d−1) √ −Kρ). Specifi- cally, for a point x∈H d K at hyperbolic distance ρ from the origino= (1/ √ −K,0, . . . ,0), we have x0 = 1√ −K cosh √ −K ρ  ∼ 1 2 √ −K exp √ −K ρ  as ρ→ ∞ . Thus, the Lorentz factor weighting undercom- pensates for the exponential growth of hyperbolic balls at large radii by a factor ofexp (d−2) √ −K ρ  . These results establish that neither Euclidean averaging nor the standard Einstein midpoint satisfies the outward- bias property required for hierarchy-preserving aggregation. This motivates the design of a pooling operator with ex- plicit radial amplification. The proof of this Proposition is available in Appendix A.3. 4.3. Outward Einstein Midpoint Pooling To mitigate radial contraction during aggregation, we in- troduce theOutward Einstein Midpoint, a geometry-aware pooling operator that explicitly amplifies the contribution of tokens with larger hyperbolic radius. Let {xi}n i=1 ⊂H d K denote a sequence of token embeddings, with optional atten- tion weights wi ≥0 , and λi denoting the Lorentz factors.We define a radius-dependent weighting function ϕ(xi) =x p i,0, p >0, which is monotone in the radial coordinate. The Outward Einstein Midpoint is then given by mOEM K,p = Pn i=1 (wi ϕ(xi))λ ixiPn i=1 (wi ϕ(xi))λ i , followed by reprojection onto the hyperboloidH d K. As shown in Figure 3, by construction, this operator assigns
