levels: from Level 1 (most general, e.g., document-level topics) to Level 5 (most specific, e.g., fine- grained entities). Figure 4 presents these results. The fully hyperbolic model demonstrates clear hierarchical organi- zation with radii increasing monotonically from Level 1 (2.902) to Level 5 (3.488, +20.2%). This shows the model naturally places general concepts near the origin and spe- cific details toward the boundary, consistent with hyper- bolic geometry, where proximity to the origin represents generality. Euclidean models show flat or decreasing dis- tributions. Baselines maintain constant norms across levels 7 HypRAG Figure 4.Empirical validation of hierarchical encoding.

Hybrid models exhibit substantially larger radii from the hy- perbolic component. The fine-tuned hybrid increases from 116.9 to 146.7, showing that fine-tuning induces structured hierarchy. We have attached the dataset for this case study in the supplementary material. The concept level hierarchy data is available in Appendix C. Ablation Studies.We compare two pooling strategies for aggregating token embeddings into document representa- tions: CLS token pooling and OEM pooling. CLS pool- ing uses the representation of a special classification token, while OEM pooling performs geometry-aware aggregation directly in hyperbolic space. Table 4 shows that OEM pool- ing yields higher performance across both mean task and mean task-type metrics on MTEB retrieval tasks, indicating more effective document-level aggregation in the hyperbolic setting. We also show that using geodesic distance in the contrastive objective outperforms the Lorentz inner product (Appendix Table A2), suggesting better alignment of repre- sentations on the manifold. Additionally, hyperbolic models maintain strong performance with smaller retrieval budgets,
