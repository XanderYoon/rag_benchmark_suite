Standard approaches map representations to tangent space, aggregate in Euclidean space, then map back to the manifold (Yang et al., 2024; Desai et al., 2023), but this distorts hierarchical structure encoded in radial depth in both the models. In the following subsections, we analyze this failure mode formally and in- troduce a pooling operator designed to preserve hierarchical information. 4.2. Failure of Naïve Hyperbolic Pooling Naïve pooling strategies that aggregate in Euclidean space (Yang et al., 2024; Desai et al., 2023) systemati- cally contract representations toward the origin. This fol- lows from hyperbolic convexity: for any {xi}n i=0 ⊂H d K, the barycenter lies strictly closer to the origin than the maximum-radius point unless all points coincide. Conse- quently, document-level embeddings lose the radial separa- tion that encodes document specificity through hierarchical depth. To address this failure mode, we first establish no- tation for projecting ambient vectors onto the hyperboloid and measuring radial depth. Definition 4.1(Lorentz Projection).For v∈R d+1 with ⟨v,v⟩ L <0 and v0 >0 , let ΠK(v) = v√ K⟨v,v⟩ L denote the unique positive rescaling satisfying ⟨ΠK(v),Π K(v)⟩L = 1/K. Definition 4.2(Radial Depth).The radial depth of x∈H d K is r(x) =x 0. Since x0 = 1√−K cosh( √ −K ρ) where ρ=d K(o,x) , ordering by x0 is equivalent to ordering by intrinsic hyperbolic distance from the origin. Semantically, radial depth encodesconcept specificity: gen- eral concepts should lie near the origin while fine-grained entities should have larger radii. This provides a measurable signature for evaluating whether models learn meaningful hierarchical structure. The simplest aggregation strategy is Euclidean averaging in the ambient space followed by reprojection. However, this approach provably contracts rep- resentations toward the origin (Ganea et al., 2018a; Chami et al., 2019), destroying hierarchical structure encoded in radial depth. We formalize this in the following
