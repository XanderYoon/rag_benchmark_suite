field of Machine Learning, specifically dense retrieval for retrieval-augmented generation systems. By improving the geometric fidelity of document embeddings, our approach aims to reduce retrieval errors that can lead to hallucinated or poorly grounded responses in RAG systems. We believe more accurate retrieval contributes positively to the reliabil- ity of AI-generated content. Additionally, our fully hyper- bolic model demonstrates improved parameter efficiency, which may reduce computational costs and environmental impact associated with training and deploying embedding models. There are many potential societal consequences of our work, none which we feel must be specifically high- lighted here. References Asai, A., Wu, Z., Wang, Y ., Sil, A., and Hajishirzi, H.
