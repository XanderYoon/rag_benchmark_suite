with equality iff xi =x j. As weights concentrate on fewer points (larger q), the sum decreases toward 1. Thus as q increases: the numerator (v(q) 0 )2 increases, while the denominator K⟨v (q),v (q)⟩L decreases. Both effects increase r(m(q))2, establishing monotonicity. Forp≥1>0, we concluder(m OEM K,p ) =r(m (p))≥r(m (0)) =r(m Ein K ).2 B. RAG Prompt For each retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) query, we construct a single inference prompt by concatenating the top-|C| retrieved documents into the context window of the language model. The documents are provided verbatim, without re-ranking or compression, and are ordered according to their retrieval score. The language model is then instructed to generate an answer conditioned solely on the retrieved context and the user query, ensuring that any factual content in the response must be supported by the retrieved evidence.

Hierarchical Document Probe Dense retrieval models implicitly induce a geometry over documents. While Euclidean encoders often cluster documents based on surface-level similarity, they struggle to faithfully represent hierarchical relationships that arise naturally in language and knowledge organization. Hyperbolic spaces, by contrast, are well suited for embedding tree-like and taxonomic structures due to their exponential volume growth. To qualitatively assess whether hyperbolic encoders recover such hierarchical organization, we construct a controlled document set that exhibits a clear semantic hierarchy while
