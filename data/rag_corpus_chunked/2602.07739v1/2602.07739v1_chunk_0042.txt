all metrics with the larger context window, but still falls short of the fully hyperbolic HyTE-H model. HyTE-FH also improves with increased context, while HyTE-H remains comparatively stable, achieving consistently strong performance at both context sizes. This suggests that fully hyperbolic retrieval is less sensitive to context expansion and maintains effectiveness even under smaller retrieval budgets.

Best results in bold. E.1. Case Study: The Impact of Retrieval Geometry on Answer Quality To illustrate how embedding geometry affects end-to-end RAG performance, we analyze a representative query from the Emanuel dataset where models exhibit markedly different behaviors. Query.“What is the feature of Bixby guide?” This query requires retrieving documentation about a specific Samsung TV feature: the Bixby tutorial that appears when users first interact with the voice assistant. The correct answer is contained in a single passage within the hierarchically organized e-Manual. Quantitative Comparison.Table A4 presents the evaluation metrics for each model. Only HyTE-H successfully retrieves relevant context and generates a faithful response. Qualitative Analysis.We identify four distinct outcomes based on retrieval quality and LLM response behavior: (1) Successful Retrieval (HyTE-H).The hyperbolic hybrid model retrieves the exact passage describing the Bixby guide: “When you press the button for the first time, the Using Bixby button appears... a tutorial on using Bixby is shown. ”This enables a concise, accurate response: “The feature of Bixby guide is a tutorial on using Bixby, which is shown when you press the button on your Samsung Smart Remote after the first time, and
