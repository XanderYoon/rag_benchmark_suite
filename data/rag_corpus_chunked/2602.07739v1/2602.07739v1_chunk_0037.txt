on surface-level similarity, they struggle to faithfully represent hierarchical relationships that arise naturally in language and knowledge organization. Hyperbolic spaces, by contrast, are well suited for embedding tree-like and taxonomic structures due to their exponential volume growth. To qualitatively assess whether hyperbolic encoders recover such hierarchical organization, we construct a controlled document set that exhibits a clear semantic hierarchy while ensuring that individual documents remain self-contained and independent. We design a synthetic yet semantically natural hierarchy consisting of five levels of increasing specificity: Science→ Mathematics→Algebra→Linear Algebra→Linear Transformations. At each level, we generate five independent paragraphs that are topically coherent but do not explicitly reference parent or child topics. Importantly, documents at deeper levels refine the semantic scope of higher-level topics without sharing explicit lexical markers or cross-document A4 HypRAG dependencies. This construction isolates hierarchical structure as a latent semantic property rather than an artifact of explicit cues. All paragraphs are embedded independently with no hierarchical supervision. We analyze the resulting embeddings by inspecting their relative organization in the learned space. Hyperbolic models are expected to organize documents according to semantic specificity, with broader concepts closer to the origin and more specific concepts at increasing radial depth. We present a few of them here and we have attached the data file in supplementary material. Hierarchical Document Texts (Verbatim) [SCIENCE] Science is a systematic way of understanding the natural world through observation , experimentation , and reasoning . It encompasses a wide range of disciplines that study phenomena from the smallest subatomic particles to the vast structure of the universe . At its core , science seeks patterns , explanations , and predictive principles that help humans make sense of reality . [MATHEMATICS] Mathematics also plays a central role in modeling complex systems. By formalizing assumptions and relationships , mathematical models help
