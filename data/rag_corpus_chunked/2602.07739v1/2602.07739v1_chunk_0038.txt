range of disciplines that study phenomena from the smallest subatomic particles to the vast structure of the universe . At its core , science seeks patterns , explanations , and predictive principles that help humans make sense of reality . [MATHEMATICS] Mathematics also plays a central role in modeling complex systems. By formalizing assumptions and relationships , mathematical models help clarify underlying mechanisms and enable precise predictions under well−defined conditions . [ALGEBRA] Modern algebra emphasizes structural relationships over explicit computation. Rather than focusing on individual equations , it studies entire systems of elements and operations , revealing patterns that persist across different mathematical settings . [LINEAR ALGEBRA] The power of linear algebra lies in its balance between abstraction and computation. While grounded in rigorous theory , it offers efficient numerical techniques that scale to high−dimensional problems. [LINEAR TRANSFORMATIONS] Linear transformations form the foundation of many applied systems, from computer graphics to neural networks. Understanding their behavior is essential for analyzing stability , expressiveness , and computational efficiency . D. Runtime and Computational Complexity In this section, we analyze the computational complexity of the proposed hyperbolic dense retrieval system and compare it to a standard Euclidean transformer-based retriever. Let n denote the input sequence length, d the hidden dimension, h the number of attention heads, andLthe number of transformer layers. Hyperbolic Transformer Encoder.The HyTE-FH encoder follows the standard transformer structure, with all linear, normalization, attention, and residual operations replaced by their Lorentzian counterparts. Crucially, these operations preserve the same asymptotic complexity as their Euclidean analogues. Each Lorentz linear transformation (HLT) consists of a matrix multiplication followed by a constant number of scalar operations and a reprojection. This incurs O(nd2) time per layer, identical to a Euclidean linear layer up to constant factors. A5 HypRAG Hyperbolic self-attention computes pairwise geodesic distances between
