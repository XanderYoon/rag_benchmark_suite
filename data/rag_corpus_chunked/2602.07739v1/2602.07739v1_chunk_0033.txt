i.e., all points are identical.2 A1 HypRAG A.3. Proof of Proposition 4.5 Proposition A.3(Implicit Radial Weighting is Insufficient).The Einstein midpoint weights points by the Lorentz factor λi =x i,0, but this weighting grows as exp( √ −K ρ) while hyperbolic volume grows as exp((d−1) √ −K ρ). The Lorentz factor weighting therefore undercompensates by a factor ofexp((d−2) √ −K ρ)ford≥3. Proof. We establish the asymptotic growth rates of the Lorentz factor and hyperbolic volume separately, then compare them. Step 1: Lorentz factor asymptotics.The hyperbolic distance from the origin o= (1/ √ −K,0, . . . ,0) to a point x∈H d K is: ρ=d K(o,x) = 1√ −K cosh−1(K⟨o,x⟩ L). Computing the inner product: ⟨o,x⟩ L =− x0√ −K , soK⟨o,x⟩ L =−K·(−x 0/ √ −K) = √ −K x0. Thus: ρ= 1√ −K cosh−1( √ −K x0). Inverting this relation: x0 = 1√ −K cosh( √ −K ρ). For largeρ, usingcosh(t)∼ 1 2 et: x0 ∼ 1 2 √ −K exp( √ −K ρ). Hence the Lorentz factorλ=x 0 grows asexp( √ −K ρ). Step 2: Hyperbolic volume asymptotics.The volume of a geodesic ball of radiusρinH d K is: Vol(Bρ) = ωd−1 (−K) (d−1)/2 Z ρ 0 sinhd−1( √ −K t)dt, whereω d−1 = 2πd/2/Γ(d/2)is the surface area of the unit(d−1)-sphere. For largeρ, usingsinh(t)∼ 1 2 et: Vol(Bρ)∼C d exp((d−1) √ −K ρ), whereC d is a dimension-dependent constant. Step 3: Compensation deficit.The ratio of volume growth to Lorentz factor growth is: Vol(Bρ) λ ∼ exp((d−1) √ −K ρ) exp( √ −K ρ) = exp((d−2) √ −K ρ). For d≥3 , this ratio diverges as ρ→ ∞ , demonstrating that the Lorentz factor provides insufficient compensation for the exponential growth of hyperbolic space at large radii.2 A.4.
