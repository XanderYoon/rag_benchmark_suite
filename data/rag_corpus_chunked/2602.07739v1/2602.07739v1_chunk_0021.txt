performance across both mean task and mean task-type metrics on MTEB retrieval tasks, indicating more effective document-level aggregation in the hyperbolic setting. We also show that using geodesic distance in the contrastive objective outperforms the Lorentz inner product (Appendix Table A2), suggesting better alignment of repre- sentations on the manifold. Additionally, hyperbolic models maintain strong performance with smaller retrieval budgets, whereas Euclidean baselines require larger context windows to achieve comparable results (Appendix Table A3).

Conclusion We introduced hyperbolic dense retrieval for RAG, show- ing that aligning embedding geometry with the hierarchical structure of language improves faithfulness and answer qual- ity. Our approach preserves document-level structure during aggregation through a geometry-aware pooling operator, ad- dressing a key failure mode of Euclidean retrieval pipelines. Across evaluations, we observe consistent gains using mod- els substantially smaller than current state-of-the-art retriev- ers, highlighting the effectiveness of hyperbolic inductive bias over scale alone. Case studies further show that hy- perbolic representations organize documents by specificity through norm-based separation, a property absent in Eu- clidean embeddings. These findings suggest that embedding geometry is a central design choice for reliable retrieval in RAG systems, with implications for future scalable and multimodal retrieval architectures. 8 HypRAG Impact Statement This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of Machine Learning, specifically dense retrieval for retrieval-augmented generation systems. By improving the geometric fidelity of document embeddings, our approach aims to reduce retrieval errors that can lead to hallucinated or poorly grounded responses in RAG systems. We believe more accurate retrieval contributes positively to the reliabil- ity of AI-generated content. Additionally, our fully hyper- bolic model demonstrates improved
