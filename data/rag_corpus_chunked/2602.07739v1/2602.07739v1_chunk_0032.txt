if and only ifx=y. 2 A.2. Proof of Proposition 4.3 Proposition A.2(Euclidean Mean Contracts).Let {xi}n i=1 ⊂H d K with n≥2 . Define the Euclidean mean ¯x= 1 n Pn i=1 xi and its projection onto the hyperboloidm Euc = ΠK(¯x). Then: r(mEuc)≤ 1 n nX i=1 r(xi) with equality if and only if allx i are identical. Proof.We first verify that the projection is well-defined, then establish the contraction inequality. We must show⟨ ¯x, ¯x⟩L <0and¯x 0 >0. The latter is immediate since¯x 0 = 1 n P i xi,0 >0. For the former, compute: K⟨¯x, ¯x⟩L =K * 1 n X i xi, 1 n X j xj + L = 1 n2 X i,j K⟨x i,x j⟩L. By Lemma A.1, each term satisfiesK⟨x i,x j⟩L ≥1. Therefore: K⟨¯x, ¯x⟩L ≥ 1 n2 ·n 2 = 1>0. SinceK <0, this implies⟨ ¯x, ¯x⟩L <0, confirming projectability. The projection is given bym Euc = ¯x/ p K⟨¯x, ¯x⟩L, so the radial depth satisfies: r(mEuc) = ¯x0p K⟨¯x, ¯x⟩L . From Step 1, we haveK⟨ ¯x, ¯x⟩L ≥1, hence p K⟨¯x, ¯x⟩L ≥1. Therefore: r(mEuc) = ¯x0p K⟨¯x, ¯x⟩L ≤¯x0 = 1 n nX i=1 xi,0 = 1 n nX i=1 r(xi). Equality holds if and only if p K⟨¯x, ¯x⟩L = 1, which by Step 1 requiresK⟨x i,x j⟩L = 1for all pairsi, j. By Lemma A.1, this occurs if and only ifx i =x j for alli, j, i.e., all points are identical.2 A1 HypRAG A.3. Proof of Proposition 4.5 Proposition A.3(Implicit Radial Weighting is Insufficient).The Einstein midpoint weights points by the Lorentz factor λi =x i,0, but this weighting grows as exp( √ −K ρ) while hyperbolic volume grows as exp((d−1) √ −K ρ). The Lorentz factor weighting therefore undercompensates by a factor ofexp((d−2) √ −K ρ)ford≥3.
