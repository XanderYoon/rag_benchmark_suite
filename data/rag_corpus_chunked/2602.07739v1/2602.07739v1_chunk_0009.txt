HyTE-H Architecture. weights are computed using squared hyperbolic geodesic distances (He et al., 2025c; Chen et al., 2022) as νi,j = exp −d2 K(qi,k j)/√m  Pn l=1 exp(−d2 K(qi,k l)/√m) , with head dimension m. This prioritizes geodesic proximity rather than angular similarity. The attended representation is obtained via a Lorentzian weighted midpoint AttL(x)i = Pn j=1 νi,jλjvj √ −K Pn j=1 νi,jλjvj L , where λj =v j,0 is the Lorentz factor. Unlike Euclidean averaging, this aggregation remains on Hd K and preserves radial structure during contextualization. 4. Method We now outline our approach to hyperbolic dense retrieval. We begin by introducing the two proposed HyTE architec- tures, followed by an analysis of why naïve pooling strate- gies fail in hyperbolic space, and conclude by presenting our geometry-aware aggregation operator. 4.1. Architecture The hyperbolic encoder components described in Section 3 form the building blocks (Figure 2A) of HyTE-FH, our fully hyperbolic transformer (Figure 2B). By operating entirely within hyperbolic geometry, HyTE-FH preserves hierar- chical structure throughout token-level contextualization, aggregation, and similarity computation, with semantic ab- straction and specificity encoded along radial dimensions. HyTE-H (Figure 2C) instead projects pretrained Euclidean representations into hyperbolic space, which allows hyper- bolic geometry to be leveraged with a strong initialization and avoiding the need to train a fully hyperbolic encoder from scratch. While hyperbolic self-attention enables geometry-consistent contextualization at the token level, dense retrieval re- quires aggregating variable-length sequences into fixed- dimensional representations. Standard approaches map representations to tangent space, aggregate in Euclidean space, then map back to the manifold (Yang et al., 2024; Desai et al., 2023), but this distorts hierarchical structure encoded in radial depth in both the models. In the following subsections, we analyze this failure mode formally and in- troduce a pooling operator designed to preserve hierarchical information. 4.2.
