HypRAG: Hyperbolic Dense Retrieval for Retrieval Augmented Generation Hiren Madhu 1 Ngoc Bui 1 Ali Maatouk 1 Leandros Tassiulas1 Smita Krishnaswamy 1 Menglin Yang2 Sukanta Ganguly 3 Kiran Srinivasan 3 Rex Ying 1 Abstract Embedding geometry plays a fundamental role in retrieval quality, yet dense retrievers for retrieval- augmented generation (RAG) remain largely con- fined to Euclidean space. However, natural lan- guage exhibits hierarchical structure from broad topics to specific entities that Euclidean embed- dings fail to preserve, causing semantically distant documents to appear spuriously similar and in- creasing hallucination risk. To address these limi- tations, we introduce hyperbolic dense retrieval, developing two model variants in the Lorentz model of hyperbolic space: HyTE-FH, a fully hyperbolic transformer, and HyTE-H, a hybrid architecture projecting pre-trained Euclidean em- beddings into hyperbolic space. To prevent rep- resentational collapse during sequence aggrega- tion, we introduce the Outward Einstein Mid- point, a geometry-aware pooling operator that provably preserves hierarchical structure. On MTEB, HyTE-FH outperforms equivalent Eu- clidean baselines, while on RAGBench, HyTE-H achieves up to 29% gains over Euclidean base- lines in context relevance and answer relevance us- ing substantially smaller models than current state- of-the-art retrievers. Our analysis also reveals that hyperbolic representations encode document specificity through norm-based separation—with over 20% radial increase from general to specific concepts—a property absent in Euclidean embed- dings, underscoring the critical role of geometric inductive bias in faithful RAG systems1. 1.
