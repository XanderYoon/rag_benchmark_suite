optimization results for DAiD and FAiD on FID scores. Left: FID scores for DAiD across different combinations of retrieval temperature τ and merging weight λ. Right: FID scores for FAiD across varying levels of hop h and numbers of blender modules b. All experiments conducted on the Midjourney-10K benchmark, with optimal configurations highlighted by red borders. Both DAiD and FAiD require careful optimization of distinct sets of hyperparameters. For DAiD, we optimize the retrieval temperature τ and merging weight λ, which control the retrieval-based probability distribution sharpness and the balance between retrieval and model predictions, respec- tively. For FAiD, we focus on the level of hop (h) and number of blender modules (b), determining the spatial context incorporated during retrieval and extent of feature blending. To identify optimal 17 configurations, we conducted a systematic ablation study on the Midjourney-10K benchmark using Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) as the performance metric. Figure 7 presents the FID scores for DAiD across different combinations of λ and τ, and for FAiD across varying levels of (h) and (b), where composite hop levels such as “12” indicate combined use of multiple hop distances. Analysis of the DAiD results reveals that performance degrades as λ increases, suggesting that modest integration of retrieval information enhances performance while excessive reliance impairs generative flexibility. The retrieval temperature τ demonstrates less pronounced effects, though a moderate value of 0.6 provides marginal benefits. For FAiD, configurations incorporating multiple hop levels generally outperform single hop levels, with the “12” configuration yielding optimal results. Regarding blender modules, an intermediate value consistently delivers the best performance, implying that moderate feature blending optimizes the incorporation of retrieved patches while avoiding both under-utilization and over-smoothing. Based on this analysis, we selected λ = 0.05) and τ = 0.6 for DAiD, and hop levels “12” with2 blender
