readily adaptable to a wide range of applications, making it valuable for both academic research and industrial deployment. However, as our approach builds upon existing generative models, it may inherit their biases and could potentially produce inappropriate outputs in the absence of additional safety mechanisms. Furthermore, the large-scale retrieval database may contain unsafe or undesirable content, which can be reflected in the retrieved image patches. To ensure safe deployment in real-world scenarios, additional safeguards and filtering measures are necessary to mitigate these risks. 18
