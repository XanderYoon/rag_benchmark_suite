them into a coherent scale-specific feature representation. After processing all scales for a given retrieved patch, the algorithm computes the final refined representation by averaging the scale-specific features. The normalization factor (Q − 1) accounts for the number of scales processed, ensuring consistent feature magnitudes across different retrieved patches. This averaging operation effectively combines multi-scale contextual information into a single refined representation that preserves both fine-grained details from smaller kernel sizes and broader contextual patterns from larger kernel sizes. The resulting refined patch representations maintain spatial coherence with the surrounding generation context while preserving the essential visual characteristics of the retrieved content. B Experiment Setup B.1 RA-CM3 Implementation Details Since the pretrained RA-CM3 model is not publicly available, we implement our own version following the methodology described in the original paper to serve as a representative baseline for image-level retrieval-augmented generation. Our implementation uses Janus-Pro as the backbone model to ensure fair comparison with our proposed methods, as both approaches operate on the same foundation architecture. We construct an image-level retrieval database using the same CC12M [ 5] and JourneyDB [ 36] datasets employed for our patch-level retrieval database to maintain consistency in the underlying data distribution. All images in the database are encoded into 512 dimensional vector representations using a pretrained CLIP [29] model. For each training instance in our 50,000 sample training set, we retrieve the most relevant reference image by encoding the corresponding text prompt with the same CLIP model, extracting the [CLS] token as the text representation, and computing cosine similarity scores between the text representation and all image representations in the database. The image 14 with the highest similarity score is selected as the retrieved reference. Each retrieved image is then processed through the quantized autoencoder from Janus-Pro to obtain image tokens [v1, . .
