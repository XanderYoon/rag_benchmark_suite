outperform single hop levels, with the “12” configuration yielding optimal results. Regarding blender modules, an intermediate value consistently delivers the best performance, implying that moderate feature blending optimizes the incorporation of retrieved patches while avoiding both under-utilization and over-smoothing. Based on this analysis, we selected λ = 0.05) and τ = 0.6 for DAiD, and hop levels “12” with2 blender modules for FAiD, achieving FID scores of 14.12 and 13.13, respectively. These configurations effectively harness retrieval information while preserving the generative strengths of the underlying Janus-Pro model, as demonstrated by their superior performance on the benchmark. D Limitations While our AR-RAG framework demonstrates strong performance across multiple benchmarks, several limitations should be acknowledged. First, our approach relies on discrete image tokenization and targets discrete token-based models, so it may not be directly applied to continuous diffusion models operating in latent spaces. Second, due to computational resource limitations, our retrieval database remains smaller than billion-scale databases. This limitation may introduce visual pattern biases, as the database may not fully capture the diversity of real-world visual patterns, potentially affecting the generation of underrepresented visual elements. Third, our implementation focuses exclusively on 2D image generation. While the underlying patch-based retrieval concept could theoretically extend to other structured generation tasks such as 3D point cloud generation, we have not explored these applications. E Broader impacts We propose a novel retrieval-augmented approach to enhance existing image generation models. Our method is both highly efficient and readily adaptable to a wide range of applications, making it valuable for both academic research and industrial deployment. However, as our approach builds upon existing generative models, it may inherit their biases and could potentially produce inappropriate outputs in the absence of additional safety mechanisms. Furthermore, the large-scale retrieval database may contain unsafe or undesirable content, which can be reflected
