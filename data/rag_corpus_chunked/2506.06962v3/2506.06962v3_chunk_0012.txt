3.3 million from JourneyDB [36], and 4.6 million from DataComp [12], while ensuring that any samples included in the testing set are excluded to prevent data leakage. Each image is encoded into a sequence of patch-level representations and image tokens using the same image tokenizer employed in the Janus-Pro model. For efficient similarity search, we implement our retriever using the FAISS library [21]. Training Setup We adopt Janus-Pro-1B [9] and Show-o [44] as our backbone models and fine-tune them on a dataset of 50,000 image-caption pairs sampled from CC12M [ 5] and Midjourney-v6 3. We empirically determine the optimal hyperparameters for DAiD and FAiD, and the complete hyperparameter optimization experiment results can be found in Appendix C.2. Further details regarding the training dataset construction and implementation can be found in Appendix B.3. Baselines To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, we adopt several state-of-the-art image generation approaches as baselines, including non-retrieval models such as LlamaGen [37], LDM [32], Stable Diffusion (SDv1.5 and SDv3) [31, 10], PixArt-alpha [7], DALL-E 2 [30], Show- o[44], and Janus-Pro [ 9], and image-based retrieval augmentation methods, including RDM [ 3], RA-CM3 [46], and ImageRAG[33]. Since pretrained models of RA-CM3 are not publicly available, we try our best to replicate their method based on Janus-Pro to ensure a fair comparison. More details of training and implementation of RA-CM3 can be found in Appendix B.1. Evaluation Benchmarks and Metrics To comprehensively evaluate our proposed methods, we employ three benchmarks: (1) GenEval [14], which assesses models’ ability to generate images with specific attributes and relationships described in text prompts; (2) DPG-Bench [18], which evaluates performance on detailed prompts with complex requirements; and (3) Midjourney-30k [40], where we employ three complementary metrics: FID [17] for measuring statistical similarity between generated and real image distributions, CMMD [20] for assessing
