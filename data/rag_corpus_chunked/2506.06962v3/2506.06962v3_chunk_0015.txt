Note our methods are based on Janus-Pro highlighted in gray. On GenEval, our methods show significant improvements in categories such as “Two Obj.” and “Position,” which demand accurate multi-object generation and spatial arrangement. These gains are largely due to the local and dynamic nature of our autoregressive patch-level retrieval. Consider the prompt “a green couch and an orange umbrella”, a combination that rarely co-occurs in real-world images. Static full-image retrieval methods may retrieve references containing only one of the objects. Taking these references as a global visual prior throughout the generation can lead the model to overfit to irrelevant layouts or dominant visual structures in the retrieved examples. On DPG-Bench, which features dense and highly detailed prompts, the performance gap between our method and prior retrieval-augmented approaches becomes even more substantial.

In contrast, our autoregressive aug- mentation framework overcomes this limitation by dynamically retrieving patch-level visual features based on the evolving image context rather than the original prompt, enabling more targeted and effective augmentation. On Midjourney-30K, our proposed methods con- sistently outperform both Janus-Pro and Show-o baselines across
