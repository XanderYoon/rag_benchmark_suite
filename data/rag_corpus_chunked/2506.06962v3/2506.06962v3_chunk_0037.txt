generated images that correctly align with the text descriptions. • DPG-Bench [18] (Detailed Prompt Generation Benchmark) evaluates how well image generation models handle detailed prompts with complex requirements, covering categories such as global image quality, entity generation, attribute accuracy, relationship modeling, and other complex generation tasks. Scores are reported as percentages. • For the Midjourney-30k benchmark [40], we employ three complementary metrics to evaluate the quality of generated images, including (1) Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) [17], which measures the statistical similarity between the distributions of generated and real images in the feature space of a pre-trained Inception network; (2) CLIP-MMD (CMMD) [20], which measures the distance between real and generated images using CLIP embeddings and the Maximum Mean Discrepancy, and is specifically designed to better align with human perception of image quality and addresses several limitations of FID, including poor sample efficiency and incorrect normality assumptions; and (3) Fréchet Wavelet Distance (FWD) [ 39], which measures the distance between real and generated images in the wavelet packet coefficient space. FWD captures both spatial and frequency information without relying on pre-trained networks, making it domain-agnostic and robust to domain shifts across various image types.For all three metrics, lower scores indicate higher-quality image generation, with both CMMD and FWD particularly effective in capturing distortions in generated images in ways that better correlate with human judgements. 4https://huggingface.co/datasets/brivangl/midjourney-v6-llava 16 C Experiment Results and Discussion C.1 Accuracy of Patch-based Autoregressive Retrieval Figure 6: l2 distance between ground-truth tokens and top-10 retrieved tokens (blue line) compared to randomly sampled tokens (red dashed line). The curved arrow indicates a broken y-axis that accom- modates the large gap between the retrieved token and the random token baseline. To assess the effectiveness of our patch-level autoregressive retrieval mechanism, we conduct a comparative analysis between the top- K re- trieved
