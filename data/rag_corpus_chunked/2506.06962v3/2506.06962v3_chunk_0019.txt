Table 4 shows the inference time comparisons across different models when generating 100 images using both a single L40 GPU. The DAiD method introduces only a minimal increase in inference time compared to the base Janus-Pro-1B model, with an average overhead of just 0.22%, demonstrating that DAiD maintains high computational efficiency. FAiD shows a more noticeable overhead of 36.03% on a single GPU due to its autoregressive retrieval and feature blending operations. However, this increase remains reasonable given the substan- tial performance gains in generation quality. Overall, both DAiD and FAiD do not significantly compromise the inference efficiency of Janus-Pro, making them practical for real-world applications. 6 Related Work Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm that enhances generative models by incorporating external knowledge during decoding [ 23, 13, 16, 47, 46, 15, 24, 25, 42]. Originally developed for natural language processing, RAG enables models to retrieve relevant documents to supplement parametric knowledge during response generation [4], and has been widely adopted in many downstream tasks, such as knowledge-intensive tasks [23], document fusion [19], model pretraining [16], dialogue generation [35, 1], and so on. Beyond the text domain, prior research has explored enhancing image generation by incorporating external visual references. Early approaches [ 8, 3] condition the diffusion process on retrieved images, typically encoded via CLIP or V AE encoders, to guide generation toward higher visual fidelity. KNN-Diffusion [34] extends this idea by leveraging k-nearest neighbor images to improve zero-shot generalization to novel domains. Building on this retrieval-augmented framework, more recent methods [49, 33] introduce adaptive retrieval pipelines that iteratively
