Wikidata and Wikipedia as a training dataset. Even if the streets of Melbourne are part of the test dataset, we decided to include the 22 streets detected in Melbourne in the training dataset for three reasons. First, we want to characterize the streets in Melbourne to improve inference, hence it is necessary to have data for this area. Second, the dataset for Australia is 18 times smaller than in the original paper for Germany. Third, our objective is not to find originsex nihilo but rather to detect more origins than those already recorded in gazetteers: we accept that the model is biased by having seen the training dataset. Moreover, the pre-trained LMs used in our model are also biased as they might have seen also the training dataset. The parameters for StreetToPerson are unchanged.

Results 5.1. Searcher Table 3 presents the results for the searcher. The gazetteer provides 248 streets in DS:Gazetteer with a known origin in 92.7% of the cases. Only 57.7% of the streets commemorate a person. Of those, 27.4% commemorate a local inhabitant of the area, such as a merchant or a former land owner, even though they are not explicitly named in the document3. The searcher successfully extracts a knowledge graph from DBpedia for 89.5% of the streets: the missing graphs are due to a lexical
