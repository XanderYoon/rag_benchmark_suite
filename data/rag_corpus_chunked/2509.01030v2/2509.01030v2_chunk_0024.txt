Australia; gpt-4o-mini provides insightful answers only for common knowledge whereas our models offer better and specialized answers in the long-tail knowledge. Indeed, for StreetToPerson, HR...@1 and HR∗ ...@1 are significantly lower than in our approach. With gpt-4o-mini, HRsem@1 is better than StreetToPerson but still lower than our approach; moreover, gpt-4o-mini correctly retrieves an origin for streets that are named after common elements (Plover4 Lane or Bridleway5 Walk) contrary to our model. Capacity of generalization. With limited supervision, the use of a generator aims to align a final answer with an initial question, while discriminating information. In our experiments, the generator fills this role but is not optimized to take decisions. The generator tends to systematically answer the query without hallucination; however, it seldom rejects an irrelevant top- kranker set: we only encounter the answer “There is no relevant information to answer the question” once or twice. In our experiments, limited scores for the HR@1 in Figure 3 are found.
