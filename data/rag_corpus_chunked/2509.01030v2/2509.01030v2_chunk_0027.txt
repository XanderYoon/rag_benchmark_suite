retrieval, particularly to help to associate a footprint with the mentions “near Collins Street” or “arrived in Australia.” Recent works try to tackle this intrinsic nature of spatial information [11] in language models. Nevertheless, the domain is still an open problem. Further development. In this work, the results can be extended at larger scales, notably other cities in Australia or in France for example where the ambiguity behind a place name might be limited. In this chapter, we focused on a task that requires high resources in terms of annotations for the evaluation. In a first step, the creation of a gold dataset between a place name and its origin and, in a second step, the annotation of each result in the top-10 and top-1. Despite being encapsulated in texts, spatial containment relations are better captured within hierarchies. In this aim, the high level of representation conveyed by knowledge graphs is more promising than prosaic texts. Techniques commonly applicable for natural language processing systems partially fail with spatial information: indeed, geographic information retrieval needs to know which footprints are impacted rather than which words are.
