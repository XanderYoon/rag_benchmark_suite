name. With its rich available archives, this chapter evaluates these automated tools within the streets of Melbourne, the historic center of Victoria. Developing such automated tools is challenging for at least two reasons. First, spatial queries can be highly ambiguous. For example, place names in Australia often consist of a single identifying word rather than a whole name (e.g., Batman Street in Melbourne, contrary to Avenue Simone Veil in Nice, France). To deal with ambiguity, it is often necessary to clarify the spatial context for a place name, such as the city, state, and country; the neighboring streets and the neighborhood. Our expectations about the most likely name origins vary spatially, for example, depending on whether the name appears in Melbourne, Victoria (where John Batman is a well-known historical figure who played a role in the founding of Melbourne, as well as in numerous massacres of Indigenous Australians) or in Los Angeles, California (where the comic-book character might be more relevant to the spatial context). Second, place name origins often fall within the domain of “long-tail knowledge”: discovering origins may rely on piecing together multiple low-frequency but salient occurrences in a knowledge base. For example, in a knowledge base such as DBpedia the name “Batman” is likely to appear much more frequently in association with the popular superhero than the historical figure. Identifying such long-tail instances often requires a chain of sophisticated reasoning to uncover correct answers. In this chapter, we develop a geographic information retrieval (GIR) system to automatically and effectively identify the origins of place names. We formulate the problem as a retrieval augmented generation task, allowing us to combine the strengths of traditional information retrieval and the generative capabilities of advanced language models (LMs). In our approach, relevant data is first retrieved from external knowledge sources (i.e.,
