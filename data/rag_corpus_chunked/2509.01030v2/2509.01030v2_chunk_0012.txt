= 1) document. For [kranker] knowledge graphs, an extract from the RDF/XML file is provided; the names of the knowledge graphs are: [subject 1]. . .[subjectkranker]. We want to find an answer to: “[ANCHOR QUESTION]”. These are the extracts: [KG 1]. . .[KGkranker]”. Give me a simple answer to “[ANCHOR QUESTION]”. [INSTRUCTIONSa] aInstructions: “Only use the provided information. First, choose the extract that best allows you to answer among: [title 1]. . .[titlekranker]. Delimit your chosen answer with the tags ⟨CHOICE⟩ ⟨/CHOICE⟩ . Second, give your answer by delimiting it with the tags ⟨ANSWER⟩ ⟨ /ANSWER⟩. Your answer should be concise. If it is a person, I need the first name and the last name. For example, to “Who is Rue Madame Curie in Beirut, Lebanon named after?”, write: “ ⟨CHOICE⟩ [write here your chosen source] ⟨/CHOICE⟩ ⟨ ANSWER⟩ Marie Curie ⟨/ANSWER⟩ Based on the provided information, ...” Here, the generated prompts were sent to a non fine-tuned Llama2-13B-Chat model, frozen with a 4-bit quantization. This maximum size of context is 4096, allowing us to concatenate all the chosen documents without truncation. 4. Experimental design Each place name Xplace in the gazetteer is treated independently as a sample: the results of one sample is not re-used for another place name. 4.1. Datasets We curated a dataset for evaluating the presented framework. Let DS:Gazetteer = {(X i place,yi origin)}N i=1 be the dataset containing N data samples, where the i-th sample is a pair of location X i place and its ground-truth origin yi origin. This dataset is derived from the Vicnames, a comprehensive database containing rich information about place names owned by Victorian State Government register of Geographic Place Names, Australia. In this work, we filtered this dataset to keep only street names in the city of Melbourne to perform
