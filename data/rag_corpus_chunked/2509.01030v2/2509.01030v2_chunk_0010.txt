(1) Here, y represents a country that is a positive answer to the question X. To fine-tune ColBERTv2, we also generated negative samples to the same question X, so that the model can learn to discriminate the spatial context involved in X. Specifically, we randomly sampled a country [countryk] that does not share border with [countryi] and generated a negative sample: y− = “ [countryk] shares a border with [countryi].” (2) DS:GeoNames. This dataset completes DS:GeoNames country by also capturing the closeness among cities. We extracted cities from Geonames, keeping only cities with a population of at least nhab. For these cities, we computed their pairwise spherical distance. Similar to DS:GeoNamescountry, we constructed a city graph denoted as Gcity = {V city,Ecity} where each node represents one city. Given city [cityi] and [city j], if their distance is less than or equal to the threshold dcity, we added an edge ecity i, j to the edge set, and generated a question answer pair using the following template:  X = “Give a city near [cityi] in [country(cityi)].” y+ = “[city j] in [country(city j)] is a neighbor of [cityi] in [country(cityi)].”  (i, j) (3) The negative samples in DS:GeoNames were generated in a similar way to DS:GeoNamescountry. We omit the details for conciseness. DS:QALD9RDF/XML. This dataset covers questions on general knowledge rather than focusing on spatial knowledge. Given a question X, its answer is curated by extracting sub-knowledge graphs from DBpedia in RDF/XML format. We built this dataset based on QALD9, which includes a range of questions and their corresponding SPARQL queries on DBpedia [10], denoted as {(X,ySPARQL)}. Given the i-th pair consisting question Xi and query ySPARQL,i, we executed the query and extracted the knowledge graph y+ KG,i, forming the new pair {(Xi,y+ KG,i)}. For training, we also
