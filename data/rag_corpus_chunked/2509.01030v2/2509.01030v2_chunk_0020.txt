In these cases, evident answers are already strong markers, without the need to attend to spatial understanding. Indeed, the models does not discard the answer for the query in the top-10 in more than 48% of the cases, as indicated by the HR ∗ sem@k. Moreover, MRR∗ sem is over 41% which means that the first evident answer appears quickly in the highest ranks. We observe that MAP ∗ sem is between .1 and .2: an interpretation is that, on average, 1 or 2 retrieved items among the set of top-10 contain relevant information. Nonetheless, certain names like Flinders Street are more specific thanRainbow Alley, which increases the chances to have more than 2 items instead
