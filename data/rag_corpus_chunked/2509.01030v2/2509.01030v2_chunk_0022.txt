a spatial dataset (b) C2a ( /gl⌢be-asia+ /commen◎s) - trained on a spatial dataset Figure 2. Retrieved items for 15 place names regarding geo aus and geo vic. A fine-tuning is expected to highlight spatially related candidates at the highest ranks, which is characterized by the nDCG@10. of priority, human understanding would focus on spatial similarities, as indicated in the anchor-question, by giving better ranks for items related to Melbourne, Victoria, or Australia. This characteristic is not fully respected by our results. For all the models, the scores for the nDCGgeo ...@k and MAPgeo ...@k are worse than nDCGgeo ...@∗k and MAP∗ geo ... with a systematic difference of more than .05. This indicates that the models tend to provide more attention to the semantic aspect than the two spatial in-context Identifying Origins of Place Names Via Retrieval Augmented Generation filters. In other words, mentioning in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia in the anchor- question does not act as a filter. Effect of training. In these cases, fine-tuning is mainly useful to read the RDF format and to find similarities based of the global meanings, with a compromise with spatial understanding. Training with DS:QALD9RDF/XML offers better models for the evaluation sem than the baseline C0 [ ∅] since ColBERT now understands the RDF/XML format. However, there is a compromise between the semantic and the spatial scores: a previous fine- tuning on DS:GeoNames country and DS:GeoNames reduced the scores on sem to offer better scores for geo aus or geo vic as shown in Figure 2 for example. As a surprising result, training on a fine-grained grid of locations with DS:GeoNames does not improve scores on fine locations geo vic but only on coarse locations with geo aus. We propose two explanations to this observation: first, DS:GeoNames contains more mentions to countries that
