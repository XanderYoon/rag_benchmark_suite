systems. An example of machine learning for street names. Despite its limited information in comparison with DBpedia, Wikidata is an atomic knowledge graph used in StreetToPerson [9]. This model restricts the candidates for the origin of place names to persons only: given a place name X Street, StreetToPerson extracts vectors of attributes (e.g., name, occupation, place) for persons having X in their name and then trains a random forest classifier. 3. Methodology and architecture Our model is designed to identify the origin of a place name by extracting related knowledge from a spatial knowledge graph. Anchor-question. An example question that our model aims to solve is: “Who is the person that Batman Street in Melbourne is named after?” We formulate such a question into the following format: “ Who (A) is [Xplace] most likely named after (A), in [city([Xplace])] (B), [country([Xplace])] (C)? If it is not a person (A), find any other origin (A). ” Here, Xplace represents the target place name. As our model is based on language model generation, the template above will focus more on a person origin of Xplace ( A ). It also implies a spatial context involving a coarse spatial filter ( C ) and a finer-grained spatial filter ( B ). To retrieve the answer, the model first uses a searcher to extract candidate answers from DBpedia. Then, it uses an indexer-ranker to rank these candidates based on their closeness with the query. Finally, a generator module produces the final answer from the ranked list of candidates. These three modules are detailed below, with reference to the overall architecture illustrated in Figure 1. 3.1. Searcher. Given a query for the origin of a place name, the searcher module aims to extract any relevant data from an external spatial knowledge graph. In this work,
