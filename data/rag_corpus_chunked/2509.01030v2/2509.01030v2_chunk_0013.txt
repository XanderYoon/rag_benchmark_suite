is a pair of location X i place and its ground-truth origin yi origin. This dataset is derived from the Vicnames, a comprehensive database containing rich information about place names owned by Victorian State Government register of Geographic Place Names, Australia. In this work, we filtered this dataset to keep only street names in the city of Melbourne to perform a focused study. In addition, for each place name, we extracted its root name by removing any prefix and street type, e.g., converting Little Bourke Street to Bourke. The resultant dataset contains 248 entries, i.e., N = 248. Horde Vo, Duckham, He, and Benli As mentioned in Section 3, three datasets are curated to fine-tune the underlying language model, ColBERTv2, of the indexer-ranker: DS:GeoNames country, DS:GeoNames, and DS:QALD9 RDF/XML. To prepare DS:GeoNames country, we kept the ratio between positive and negative answers as 1:100. To prepare the dataset DS:GeoNames, we set nhab = 50K, dcity = 50 km. For each question, we kept the ratio between positive and negative answers as 1:5 at maximum. The statistics of these datasets are presented in Table 1. 4.2. Evaluation Using DS:Gazetteer, we evaluate the model in terms of its capability in two aspects: (1) understanding semantic meaning of a query; and (2) processing spatial contexts involved in a query. The following measures are utilized to evaluate the relevance of the retrieved answer to the query: • Semantic relevance: sem. In this measurement, we focus on the semantic similarity of the retrieved answer and the textual description of the place name Xplace in the gazetteer. Suppose thatXplace is Nancy Adams Placein Melbourne that is named after a local person in Melbourne. We evaluate if the retrieved answer is semantically relevant to Xplace. For example, if the system identifies the origin as Nancy Adams who
