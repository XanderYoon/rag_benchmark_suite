Finally, a generator module produces the final answer from the ranked list of candidates. These three modules are detailed below, with reference to the overall architecture illustrated in Figure 1. 3.1. Searcher. Given a query for the origin of a place name, the searcher module aims to extract any relevant data from an external spatial knowledge graph. In this work, we used DBpedia Identifying Origins of Place Names Via Retrieval Augmented Generation as the external knowledge source, where all knowledge is stored as triplets, i.e., (subject, predicate, object). Let Xplace be the place name mentioned in the query. We used the DBpedia SPARQL endpoint to extract ksearcher triplets from the DBpedia knowledge graph. Each extracted triplet satisfies two constraints: (1) the subject must contain the place name X ∗ place name; and (2) the predicate must belong to a predefined relation set Frel, where Frel = {abstract, children, comment, country, date, geo, label, location, occupation, parent, place, spouse }. In particular, {abstract, comment} are included in Frel because triplets with these predicates usually include rich descriptions about their subjects. Extracted triplets are stored in a RDF/XML format. In order to improve the compactness of RDF/XML, all the URIs 2 were mapped with their prefixes, allowing LMs used in later modules to focus on those meaningful tokens in the URIs. 3.2. Indexer and ranker. An indexer and a ranker were developed to identify those triplets that are more relevant to the query. We developed the indexer and ranker based on ColBERTv2 [1], a pre- trained LM designed to compute the closeness between a pair of query and a triplet document in terms of semantic similarity. Here, the texts associated with a set of triplets related to one subject can be treated as one triplet document, and thus the semantic similarity between
