by focusing on the accessibility an IR system provides to the documents in a collection. Accessibility is an abstract concept coined almost 50 years ago in the land use and transportation planning ﬁeld [10], where it was deﬁned as a me asure of potential opportunities for interaction with resources like employm ent, school- ing, shopping, dining, etc. Measuring the accessibility in this context enabled many studies (e.g. [10][12][15][7]) to be performed which examined, for e xam- ple, how changes in the levels of accessibility to such opportunities aﬀ ected the urban area (in terms of economic impact, social changes and so for th). The re- sults of such studies provide valuable information to transportatio n planners and city designers in the development of land use and transportation sy stems. Be- fore this, planners and designers would focus on measures which we re based on the eﬀectiveness and eﬃciency of the transportation system (su ch as, the travel time between particular locations). However, accessibility provided a diﬀerent perspective, and while related to eﬀectiveness and eﬃciency, it tak es a more abstracted or high level view on the evaluation of transportation s ystems, con- sidering more general concerns relating to access, instead of foc using on speciﬁc instances. Their deﬁnition of accessibility 3 considers the accessibility of opportunities at locations in a physical space (such as a city). The transportatio n system is the means by which opportunities are made accessible (i.e., the road netw ork and the bus, cycle path and a bicycle, etc). In this context, the main co nsideration in the design and management of the transportation system is to loo k beyond eﬃciency and eﬀectiveness and to consider the accessibility of oppo rtunities given a certain distance or the generalized cost the user is willing to incur to
