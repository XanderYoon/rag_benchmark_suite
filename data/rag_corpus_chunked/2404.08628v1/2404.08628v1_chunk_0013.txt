with in the col- lection imposed by the IR system. For a system administrator, this c ould prove to be very useful in designing, managing and tuning the IR system (s ee [1] for empirical examples). This work represents the initial step towards formalizing accessibilit y and de- veloping accessibility measures for information spaces, in IR and mor e generally for any Information Access system. However, there are many op en problems, challenges and issues which have arisen as a result of this work. Furt her research needs to be conducted in two main directions: 1. the calibration, computation and estimation of document access ibility mea- sures, and 2. the application of document accessibility measures.
