to access the documents in the information space. Much like a particular bus ta king a pre-deﬁned route through a city. However, unlike in the physical s pace, in the information space, there is no constraint imposed by the user’s cur rent location (i.e., at a particular document) because the IR system facilitates ac cess to the collection regardless of location. The IR system is like being at a bus st op where every possible bus route is available, (i.e., the universe of all possible q ueries), and we can select any route desired, at any time. While this makes eve ry docu- ment potentially accessible, the choice of route and distance the us er is willing to travel will aﬀect just how accessible documents are in the inform ation space. 3 Accessibility is also a key concept in other areas but deﬁned diﬀerently. For in- stance, the disability rights movement advocates equal acc ess to social, political, and economic life which includes not only physical access bu t access to the same tools, services, organizations and facilities. Another ex ample is the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)’s Web Accessibility Initiative (W AI), wh ich is aimed to improve the accessibility of the World Wide Web for people using a wid e range of user agent devices, not just standard web browsers. However, accessib ility in these contexts concentrates on the physical aspects of accessing the infor mation, and even extends to issues regarding usability and mobility. In this paper, our main contribution is the introduction of the conce pt of accessibility and the proposal of how to measure accessibility in this c ontext. To do so, we ﬁrst describe the related research in Section 2 and dra w upon the extensive body of work in transportation planning and land
