This paper introduces the concept of accessibility from the ﬁeld of transportation planning and adopts it within the con text of In- formation Retrieval (IR). An analogy is drawn between the ﬁe lds, which motivates the development of document accessibility measu res for IR systems. Considering the accessibility of documents withi n a collection given an IR System provides a diﬀerent perspective on the ana lysis and evaluation of such systems which could be used to inform the d esign, tuning and management of current and future IR systems.

In pursuit of this better- ment evaluation has been instrumental in the development of IR Sys tems. While evaluation has typically focused on the eﬀectiveness [14], or the eﬃc iency [16] of the IR system, these are only two ways in which to assess the quality of an IR system. In this paper, we introduce a complementary view to evalua tion which provides a higher level view of the IR system by focusing on the accessibility an IR system provides to the documents in a collection. Accessibility is an abstract concept coined almost 50 years ago in the land use and transportation planning ﬁeld [10], where it was deﬁned as a me asure of potential opportunities for interaction with resources like employm ent, school- ing, shopping, dining, etc. Measuring the accessibility
