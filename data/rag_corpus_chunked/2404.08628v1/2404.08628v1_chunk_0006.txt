interest) to be considered, and the representation of the opportunities. First derived by [10], Gravity Based Measures provide a general method for measuring accessibility, which is widely used. They diﬀer from cumulativ e based measures in that they include a cost function within the calculation. G enerally, the cost function takes the form of a negative exponential funct ion (as described by [10], above), such that opportunities that are further away will have a lower impact on the ﬁnal accessibility value. By “further”, it is meant in ter ms of time, distance or generalized cost. While more sophisticated measures have been developed, such as Utility Based Measures [12] and Activity Based Measures [7], we shall only be consider- ing the former two methods in this work as they are the most widely us ed and accepted measures in transportation and planning. Thus, it seems reasonable to use these as a starting point to determine if they can be useful and informative in IR, before developing more sophisticated measures. 2.2 Accessibility in Information Retrieval Accessibility issues in IR have focused on restrictions (physical and virtual) to in- dex or retrieve information, whether this is because of a physical im pairment [8], restricted access due to security clearance [11], or the inability to c rawl portions of the web [4]. In each case, documents are inaccessible to the use r or the sys- tem because of some physical or virtual limitation. For instance, in t he latter case, the inability to crawl a web site means that certain documents are not indexed by the IR system, and therefore are not accessible to the user via the IR system. Recently, it was posited that the “searchability” of a we b site would be aﬀected by how easily pages can be crawled and how
