the road netw ork and the bus, cycle path and a bicycle, etc). In this context, the main co nsideration in the design and management of the transportation system is to loo k beyond eﬃciency and eﬀectiveness and to consider the accessibility of oppo rtunities given a certain distance or the generalized cost the user is willing to incur to reach these opportunities and the desirability of these opportunities. In the context of Information Retrieval, an analogy of accessibility can be made as follows. Instead of an actual physical space, in IR, we are predomi- nately concerned with accessing information within a collection of doc uments (i.e., information space), and instead of a transportation system, we have an In- formation Access System (i.e., a means by which we can access the inf ormation in the collection, like a query mechanism, a browsing mechanism, etc). The ac- cessibility of a document is indicative of the likelihood or opportunity of it being retrieved by the user in this information space given such a mechanis m. For ex- ample, in a hyper-linked collection exposed by a browsing-based syst em, a page with no incoming or outgoing links will have no accessibility. Conversely, a page with thousands of incoming links would be very accessible. Here, we co nsider the accessibility of documents given an IR system, where documents ar e accessed by querying the system. Each query provides a diﬀerent ordering in wh ich to access the documents in the information space. Much like a particular bus ta king a pre-deﬁned route through a city. However, unlike in the physical s pace, in the information space, there is no constraint imposed by the user’s cur rent location (i.e., at a particular document) because the IR system facilitates ac cess to the collection regardless of
