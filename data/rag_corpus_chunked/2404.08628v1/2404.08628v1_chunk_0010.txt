of times the document can be retrieved within that cuto ﬀ over the set Q. A gravity based measure can also be deﬁned by setting the function to reﬂect the eﬀort of going further down the ranked list, such that the fur ther down the ranking the less accessible a document becomes. There are numero us ways in which such a function could be determined. Here, we adopt the func tion sug- gested in [10], where the accessibility of the document is inversely pro portional to the rank of the document, such that: f (cdq, β) = 1 (cdq)β (2) where, the set of parameters θ includes β which is a dampening factor that adjusts how accessible the document is in the ranking. Interesting ly, if the β parameter is set to one, then accessibility of the document for the given query is equivalent to the reciprocal rank of the document, which is relate d to the (expected) search length [6]. When there is only one relevant docum ent, the expected search length is equivalent to the reciprocal rank of the document. Intuitively, the expected search length (ESL) and accessibility of d ocuments is related, because the expected search length corresponds to ho w many irrelevant documents have to be examined in order to ﬁnd the relevant docume nts. The expected search length to a particular document is proportional t o the accessi- bility of the document for a given query. However, what the access ibility measure captures is more general, i.e., how retrievable the document is given a ll possi- ble/likely queries regardless of relevancy, but this link to ESL and rec iprocal rank appears to provide a connection between accessibility and eﬀe ctiveness. As we have previously mentioned this direction is left for future work. Given either measure,
