query. However, what the access ibility measure captures is more general, i.e., how retrievable the document is given a ll possi- ble/likely queries regardless of relevancy, but this link to ESL and rec iprocal rank appears to provide a connection between accessibility and eﬀe ctiveness. As we have previously mentioned this direction is left for future work. Given either measure, A(d) provides an indication of the opportunity of retrieving d. This value can be obtained for each document d ∈ D so that we can compare whether there is more opportunity to retrieve one do cument over another. Using this measure to compare groups of documents has potential to aid in the design, management and tuning of retrieval systems in a nu mber of ways. Imagine that for a given collection of documents and a given IR system, the average A(d) of a set of documents is extremely high, while for another set of documents the average A(d) is very low. Perhaps, the ﬁrst set of documents was a group of site entry pages, and our system has a prior towards su ch pages, thus we would expect these pages to have a higher A(d). In this case, it is desirable that these documents are so accessible. On the other hand, if the set of highly accessible pages was composed of spam pages, because these pag es have used “tricks” to artiﬁcially inﬂate the number of queries for which they ar e retrieved, then this is not desirable and the system needs to be adjusted. Alte rnatively, if there is a set of documents which are virtually inaccessible in the colle ction, then it is a management decision to decide whether these documents should be included in the index or not. At a higher level, the measure A(d) motivates questions
