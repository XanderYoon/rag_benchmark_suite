point 1 is the summa tion of the ac- cessibility to each of the individual areas around point 1. T herefore, as more and more jobs are located nearer to point 1, the accessibilit y to employment at point 1 will increase. Key to this deﬁnition is the notion that as opportunities become furt her away the less accessible they become, and that by considering all po ssibilities to opportunities subject to the cost function based on the distance apart, provides a measure of accessibility. Essentially, this measure quantiﬁes the potential of opportunities for interaction [10]. In the context of IR, the opportunities are the documents in the information space, and we wish to capture the potential of documents for retrieval . 2.1 Measures of Accessibility in T ransportation Planning There are numerous measures of accessibility that have been prop osed in the ﬁeld of Transportation Planning; the simplest and most popular meas ures are the Cumulative Opportunity Measures and Gravity Based Measures . Cumulative Opportunity Measures also known as Isochrone measures count the number of opportunities that can be reached within a given trav el time, distance, or generalized cost [15]. An example application of the mea sure is “the total number of dining opportunities within 400 metres”. The advan tage of this measure is that it is intuitive and easy to compute. However, the mea sure is sensitive to the size of the range (around the point of interest) to be considered, and the representation of the opportunities. First derived by [10], Gravity Based Measures provide a general method for measuring accessibility, which is widely used. They diﬀer from cumulativ e based measures in that they include a cost function within the calculation. G enerally, the cost function takes the form of a negative exponential funct ion (as
