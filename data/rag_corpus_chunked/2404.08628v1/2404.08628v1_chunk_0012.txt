ar e retrieved, then this is not desirable and the system needs to be adjusted. Alte rnatively, if there is a set of documents which are virtually inaccessible in the colle ction, then it is a management decision to decide whether these documents should be included in the index or not. At a higher level, the measure A(d) motivates questions regarding how ac- cessible documents in the collection should be, and whether we are int erested in trying to “hide” or “promote” certain documents within the collect ion. Or whether we should adopt an approach that ensures access to the information is free from bias, i.e. “universal access” 4 so that any document is as accessible as any other document in the collection. This provides a novel framework for mea- suring document accessibility, which enables the consideration of su ch questions and issues. 4 As previously mentioned, the disability rights movement ad vocates equal access and terms this notion as universal access. 4 Conclusion and Future Work The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of the concep t of ac- cessibility and quantifying the accessibility of documents in the collect ion given a particular IR system. Measures of accessibility are not performa nce measures like eﬀectiveness or eﬃciency, but instead are measures of the potential of doc- uments for retrieval (a.k.a., their retrievability [2]). This abstraction provides a novel way to quantify and detect diﬀerent levels of accessibility with in the col- lection imposed by the IR system. For a system administrator, this c ould prove to be very useful in designing, managing and tuning the IR system (s ee [1] for empirical examples). This work represents the initial step towards formalizing accessibilit y and de- veloping accessibility measures for information spaces, in IR and mor e generally
