examining the inﬂu ence of the IR system to restrict or promote access to the information within the collection as opposed to other restrictions. This paper hopes to es tablish the idea of accessibility as an integral concept in the ﬁeld by highlighting its pot ential in the practical task of developing, building, and optimizing IR Systems , as well as diagnostics and evaluation. 3 Measuring Document Accessibility Given a collection D, an IR system accepts a user query q and returns a ranking of documents Rq, which are deemed to be relevant to q from within D by the IR system. We can consider the accessibility of a document as a system dependent factor that measures how retrievable it is, with respect to the colle ction D and the ranking function used by the IR system. Using the analogy of tr ansporta- tion, entering a query is like to choosing a particular bus, where the o rder of documents returned are like the order of destinations reached fo r that given bus route. Opportunities to interact with resources while traveling alon g the route are reﬂected by going through the documents returned in the ran king Rq. The accessibility of the resources (i.e., documents) is dependant on the willingness of the user to travel a certain distance along the route (i.e., trave rse down the ranked list) and all the queries that users are likely to travel along. So, by adapt- ing the measures from transportation planning, we propose a gene ral measure of the accessibility of a document, as: A(d) = ∑ q∈Q oq · f (cdq, θ) (1) where oq denotes the likelihood of expressing query q from the universe of queries Q and f (cdq, θ) is a generalized utility/cost function where cdq is the distance
