instance, in t he latter case, the inability to crawl a web site means that certain documents are not indexed by the IR system, and therefore are not accessible to the user via the IR system. Recently, it was posited that the “searchability” of a we b site would be aﬀected by how easily pages can be crawled and how well the searc h engine matches and ranks them [13]. Searchability and accessibility are ther efore very similar concepts. However, we are concerned with the inﬂuence of t he IR sys- tem on accessing documents. Others (e.g. [9][5]) have considered ho w documents are accessed from the index in the retrieval process to facilitate m ore eﬃcient retrieval by considering processor, disk and memory constraints . For instance “access-ordered indices” [9] are where the documents which are m ore likely to be returned at higher ranks are placed before those that are not likely to be returned at higher ranks. Another example, is the caching of quer ies [3], in web search engines, where results pages are cached in response to po pular queries in order to facilitate eﬃcient access. In essence, IR is all about accessing information , and how the information is accessed . Our work is focused on measuring the accessibility of documents in the collection given the IR system used to access these document s. This is diﬀerent from past work, in that we are speciﬁcally examining the inﬂu ence of the IR system to restrict or promote access to the information within the collection as opposed to other restrictions. This paper hopes to es tablish the idea of accessibility as an integral concept in the ﬁeld by highlighting its pot ential in the practical task of developing, building, and optimizing IR Systems , as well
