by adapt- ing the measures from transportation planning, we propose a gene ral measure of the accessibility of a document, as: A(d) = ∑ q∈Q oq · f (cdq, θ) (1) where oq denotes the likelihood of expressing query q from the universe of queries Q and f (cdq, θ) is a generalized utility/cost function where cdq is the distance associated with accessing d through q which is deﬁned by the rank of the doc- ument, and θ is a parameter or set of parameters given the speciﬁc type of measure. A cumulative based measure can then be deﬁned as follows: θ = c, where c denotes the maximum rank that a user is willing to proceed down the ra nked list. The function f (cdq, c) returns a value of 1 if cdq ≤ c (with the top-most position considered as rank 1), and 0 otherwise. So, if returning a d ocument in response to a given query has a distance greater than c associated with it, then it is considered unaccessible (for this query). For another qu ery however, the document may be accessible because the cost of accessing it is within the distance c. Alternatively, the document could be considered accessible for th e same query but to a user who has a higher cost threshold. Since all the documen ts within the cutoﬀ deﬁned by c are equally weighted, this type of measure emphasizes the number of times the document can be retrieved within that cuto ﬀ over the set Q. A gravity based measure can also be deﬁned by setting the function to reﬂect the eﬀort of going further down the ranked list, such that the fur ther down the ranking the less accessible a document becomes. There are numero us ways in which such
