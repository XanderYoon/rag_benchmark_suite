extends to issues regarding usability and mobility. In this paper, our main contribution is the introduction of the conce pt of accessibility and the proposal of how to measure accessibility in this c ontext. To do so, we ﬁrst describe the related research in Section 2 and dra w upon the extensive body of work in transportation planning and land use t o provide the basis in developing measures of accessibility for IR system. Then in Section 3, we propose two IR based accessibility measures that are analogo us to those in the ﬁeld of transportation. The introduction of accessibility pres ents many diﬀerent possibilities and challenges which can not be fully addressed h ere, so we summarize this initial contribution in Section 4. 2 Related Work In Hansen’s seminal paper [10] on measuring accessibility in transpor tation plan- ning and land use, he deﬁnes how accessibility could be measured: a measurement of the spatial distribution of activities abo ut a point ad- justed for the ability and the desire of people or ﬁrms to over come spatial separation. More speciﬁcally, the formulation states that the accessibility at point 1 to a particular type of activity at area 2 (say employm ent) is directly proportional to the size of the activity at area 2 (number of j obs) and inversely proportional to some function of the distance separating po int 1 from area 2. The total accessibility to employment at point 1 is the summa tion of the ac- cessibility to each of the individual areas around point 1. T herefore, as more and more jobs are located nearer to point 1, the accessibilit y to employment at point 1 will increase. Key to this deﬁnition is the notion that as opportunities become furt her away the less accessible they
