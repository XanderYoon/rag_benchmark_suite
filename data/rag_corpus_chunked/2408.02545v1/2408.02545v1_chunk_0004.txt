individual steps, they do not introduce any form of training. Khattab et al. (2023, 2022) presents a different approach, where LLM prompt- ing is represented as a programming language, to be optimized and compiled; a rather unique and general approach that could benefit RAG but has a high level of complexity due to the abstractions introduced. Saad-Falcon et al. (2024) focuses more on the evaluation aspect, by creating synthetic data and training an LLM critic to evaluate the RAG sys- tem. Hsia et al. (2024) studies aspects of retrieval on the performance of RAG; our RAG Foundry li- brary is general and enables experimentation on all aspects of RAG: retrieval, text-processing, prompt design, model selection, inference and evaluations. Recently, a concurrent work by Jin et al. (2024) proposes a RAG building framework, including some RAG implementations and datasets; we fo- cus on extensibility, letting users define custom types of pipelines with custom components. Rau et al. (2024) presents a framework, sharing a similar design-principle of extensibility-through- configuration as ours; their library imposes a spe- cific workflow structure (retriever, ranker, LLM) while our library is more general and does not im- poses any specific paradigm. 3 RAG Foundry The RAG F OUNDRY framework facilitates rapid prototyping and experimentation with various RAG settings and configurations. The library is com- posed of four modules: dataset creation, training, name: my_pipeline cache: true steps: - _target_: dataset_loaders.loaders.HFLoader inputs: main dataset_config: path: "Tevatron/wikipedia-trivia" split: train - _target_: dataset_loaders.loaders.LocalLoader inputs: fewshot-data filename: prepared-fewshot-data.jsonl - _target_: global_steps.sampling.ShuffleSelect inputs: main shuffle: 42 limit: 10000 - _target_: local_steps.retrievers.HaystackRetriever,→ inputs: main pipeline_path: configs/qdrant.yaml query_key: query docs_key: positive_passages - _target_: global_steps.sampling.FewShot inputs: main input_dataset: fewshot-data k: 3 output_key: fewshot_examples - _target_: local_steps.prompter.TextPrompter inputs: main prompt_file: prompts/basic.txt output_key: my_prompt mapping: question: query context: positive_passages fewshot: fewshot_examples answer: answers - _target_: global_steps.output.OutputData inputs: main
