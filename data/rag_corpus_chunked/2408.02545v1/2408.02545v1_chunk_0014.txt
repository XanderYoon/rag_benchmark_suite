Plans Our hope is that the library will be useful to as many people and use-cases as possible. However, due to time and resource constraint, we were able to demonstrate its usefulness on a subset of tasks and datasets. Future work can expand the evaluation to other tasks, as well as implementing other RAG techniques and evaluations. Although we designed the library to be general and customizable, there might be specific work- flows which will be difficult to run as-is and some code changes may be required. The library proved useful for our own research projects on a diverse set of datasets and tasks and extending it is easy and straightforward. Finally, despite our best efforts to offer detailed documentation in the library, there could be some missing details regarding some functionality or spe- cific use-cases. The code repository will accept suggestions, bug-fixes and pull requests. Ethics Statement In conducting our research we strive abiding to the highest ethical standards, including integrity, fairness, and societal benefit of our work. We pri- oritized data privacy and security throughout our research; any data used in our experiments was publicly available and did not contain any private information. We are committed to the principles of transparency and reproducibility; the methodolo- gies, including data pre-processing, model training, and evaluation are documented in order to enable others to replicate our findings. Code is made avail- able in an open repository. We advocate for the responsible use of LLMs and RAG augmentation. It is essential to exercise caution and verify the ac- curacy and reliability of generated text produced by LLMs. Hallucinations can have negative implica- tions, and even when RAG methods can ameliorate some of these aspects, verification and inspections are needed.
