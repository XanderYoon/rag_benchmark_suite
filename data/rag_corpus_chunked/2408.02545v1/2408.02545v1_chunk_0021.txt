A Implementation Details A.1 Prompts You are a helpful question answerer who can provide an answer given a question and relevant context. Listing 5: System instruction used in the experiments. Question: {query} Context: {docs} Listing 6: Template for inserting relevant documents as context. Question: {query} Context: {docs} Answer this question using the information given in the context above. Here is things to pay attention to: - First provide step-by-step reasoning on how to answer the question. - In the reasoning, if you need to copy paste some sentences from the context, include them in ##begin_quote## and ##end_quote##. This would mean that things outside of ##begin_quote## and ##end_quote## are not directly copy paste from the context. -
