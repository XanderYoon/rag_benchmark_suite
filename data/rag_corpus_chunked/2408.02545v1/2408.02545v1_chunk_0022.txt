context above. Here is things to pay attention to: - First provide step-by-step reasoning on how to answer the question. - In the reasoning, if you need to copy paste some sentences from the context, include them in ##begin_quote## and ##end_quote##. This would mean that things outside of ##begin_quote## and ##end_quote## are not directly copy paste from the context. - End your response with final answer in the form <ANSWER>: $answer, the answer should be succinct.
