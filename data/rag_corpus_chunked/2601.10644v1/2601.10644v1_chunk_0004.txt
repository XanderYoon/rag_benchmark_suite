Platforms like Galago [5], Indri [40], Patapsco [8], and Terrier [35] support offline experiments with traditional statistical methods, while platforms like Anserini [25, 50], Capreolus [51, 52], Experimaestro [36], FlexNeuART [2], LLM4Ranking [27], LLM-Rankers [54], OpenNIR [30], PyTerrier [32], RankLLM [54], and Tevatron [14, 29] provide support for modern neural first-stage retrieval and reranking methods [26]. These platforms are typically designed for offline IR experiments following the Cranfield paradigm. They provide reproducible in- dexing and searching capabilities to support experimentation where test queries are predefined and can be processed sequentially or in batch. Rather than provid- ing general-purpose toolkits, there has been a recent trend towards streamlining experimentation using tools designed to run specific benchmarks with a prede- fined set of collections, such as MTEB [33] and BEIR [41]. While these academic tools are useful for offline retrieval evaluation and have greatly advanced the field, their focus on offline usage limits their ability to be embedded in larger systems. They typically do not provide Web APIs to interface with downstream applications. This limitation particularly affects RAG, where retrieval is usually an up- stream or interleaving component providing retrieved information to generative 4 https://hltcoe.jhu.edu/research/scale/scale-2025/ 5 https://trec-ragtime.github.io/search_api.html 4 E. Yang et al. models [1, 9, 13, 39, 43, 46, 47]. This is a different setting from offline experi- mentation where the queries are fixed. RAG pipelines like Open Deep Research6 can dynamically generate queries to incrementally gather information for genera- tion. There are two ways to support such iterative RAG pipelines: (re-)implement the generative component within the IR platform or provide an API that can be dynamically queried by an external generative library. PyTerrier-RAG [31] takes the former
