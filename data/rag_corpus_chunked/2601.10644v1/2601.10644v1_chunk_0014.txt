Refer to theRoutIRdocumentation for more fields. In the example, we load two engines:Rank1reranker from a custom script (see Sec- tion 4.3), andqwen3-neuclirusing a FAISS index loaded from Huggingface Datasets containing Qwen3 8B embeddings. The specified document collection can be used to retrieve document text via an API or to pass documents to reranking models. thefile importsfield that allows users to specify scripts to load on-demand without modifying the package or implementing another custom entry script. Thecollectionsfield lists each collection serviced by an engine in a dic- tionary containing the name of the collection and a path to a JSONL file. Each JSON object is a document containing an ID field with arbitrary fields carrying its content.RoutIRloads each JSONL collection file and builds a memory offset lookup table to efficiently look up the document when serving the content. Such lookup tables allowRoutIRrandom access the collection file based on docu- ment IDs without reading the file sequentially or loading the entire collection into memory. RoutIRprovides several built-in
