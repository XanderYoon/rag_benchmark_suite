RAG systems are often dynamic and may involve multiple rounds of retrieval. While many state- of-the-art retrieval methods are available through academic IR platforms, these platforms are typically designed for the Cranfield paradigm in which all queries are known up front and can be batch processed of- fline. This simplification accelerates research but leaves state-of-the-art retrieval models unable to support downstream applications that require online services, such as arbitrary dynamic RAG pipelines that involve looping, feedback, or even self-organizing agents. In this work, we in- troduceRoutIR, a Python package that provides a simple and efficient HTTP API that wraps arbitrary retrieval methods, including first stage retrieval, reranking, query expansion, and result fusion. By providing a minimal JSON configuration file specifying the retrieval models to serve, RoutIRcan be used to construct and query retrieval pipelines on-the- fly using any permutation of available models (e.g., fusing the results of several first-stage retrieval methods followed by reranking). The API automatically performs asynchronous query batching and caches results by default. While many state-of-the-art retrieval methods are already supported by the package,RoutIRis also easily expandable by imple- menting theEngineabstract class. The package is open-sourced and publicly available on GitHub:http://github.com/hltcoe/routir.

Such exper- iments can be conducted through
