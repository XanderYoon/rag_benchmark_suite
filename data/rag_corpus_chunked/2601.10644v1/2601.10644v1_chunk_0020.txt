for all queries in the batch at once, which has the highest throughput despite being five times slower than PLAID-X in sequential latency. These results demonstrate the adaptivity ofRoutIRand robustness to the input types. In the next section, we demonstrate how to integrateRoutIRwith a RAG system. 6 Example of UsingRoutIRin a RAG System GPT Researcher is an open-source RAG toolkit that integrates various search engines such as Google and DuckDuckGo into a RAG system that supports plan- ning, self-reflections, and multi-agent pipelines. Figure 5 depicts a retriever in GPT Researcher interfacing withRoutIR, requiring only 21 lines of code. Since RoutIRuses the HTTP API as the interface, it does not require any other dependencies to interface with GPT Researcher. Figure 5 is an abbreviated ver- sion of the implementation (excluding some sanity checks and try-except blocks) used in HLTCOE’s system for the LiveRAG challenge at SIGIR 2025 [11]. While it would also be possible to implement GPT Researcher inside an academic IR platform, doing so would require substantially more engineering effort. RoutIR: Fast Serving of Retrieval Pipelines for RAG 13 7 Summary In this work, we introducedRoutIR, a simple and robust toolkit for wrapping and serving retrieval models to serve online queries. We described the design principles and architecture ofRoutIRand presented several use cases both in configuring the service and integration with RAG pipelines. This highlighted its ability to increase query throughput, a particularly desirable feature for RAG systems.RoutIRhas demonstrated its effectiveness and reliability as the back- bone for the 2025 JHU SCALE Workshop for more than 50 researchers and also as the search service for 2025 TREC RAGTIME Track. RoutIRis still under development with more features in the near term planned, including integration of LLM rerankers, Model Context Protocol (MCP) interface, and better resource management.RoutIRis completely open-sourced on GitHub and
