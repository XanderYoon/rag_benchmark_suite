industry to spin up a proof-of-concept application. 3 https://redis.io/ RoutIR: Fast Serving of Retrieval Pipelines for RAG 3 RoutIRhas been deployed in various research settings where it has been demonstrated to be robust and reliable. During JHU SCALE 2025, 4 a ten-week research workshop at Johns Hopkins University attended by more than 50 re- searchers working on long-form RAG,RoutIRwas able to provide the retrieval API for PLAID-X [48], SPLADE-v3 [21], and Qwen3 Embedding [53] on the TREC NeuCLIR [23], TREC RAGTIME [24], TREC BioGen [16], and TREC RAG (i.e., MS-MARCO v2 Passage) [42] document collections using only three NVIDIA 24GB TITAN RTXs. In this use case, all three retrieval systems were able to provide search results with a reasonable latency without caching, and to provide results nearly instantaneously when results were cached. With asyn- chronous HTTP requests, which is the typical use case in RAG research, since multiple queries are usually generated and searched at the same time,RoutIR provides a throughput of 3 to 10 queries per second depending on the underly- ing model.RoutIRalso powered the search service for the TREC RAGTIME track5 to provide the same PLAID-X model for all track participants. With only CPU resources, the endpoint provides a latency of around 600 ms on an AWS virtual machine when serving both TREC NeuCLIR and RAGTIME collections. In this paper, we document the design decisions, architecture, and several use cases forRoutIR. The package is publicly available on PyPI with imple- mentation available on GitHub. 2 Related Work Academic IR platformshave a long history going back to at least the mid- 1980s [4].
