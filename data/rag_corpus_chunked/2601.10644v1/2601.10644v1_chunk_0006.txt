themselves. The end user submits an HTTP request to aRoutIRendpoint for each search query, e.g.,{"service":"qwen3-neuclir","query":"where is machu picchu","limit":15 }, and receives the retrieval results of the requested 15 documents in a dictionary of document IDs and scores. A separate request delivers the document data associated with the document ID. The core design principle ofRoutIRis to be as lightweight as possible while providing a flexible service layer to mitigate the overhead of serving state- of-the-art models when they are released. InRoutIR, we limit dependencies to only essential packages and leave model-specific ones, such as Huggingface Transformers [45] and PyJNIus, 10 as extras for users to install when they are needed. 6 https://github.com/langchain-ai/open_deep_research 7 https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch 8 https://opensearch.org/ 9 https://vespa.ai/ 10 https://github.com/kivy/pyjnius RoutIR: Fast Serving of Retrieval Pipelines for RAG 5 In this section, we describe theRoutIRservice architecture, which is illus- trated in Figure 1.RoutIRhas three main components: Engines, Processors, and Pipelines. –Enginesprovide one or more core retrieval capabilities: first-stage retrieval using an index, reranking, query rewriting, and result fusion. To add new methods toRoutIR, the user writes an Engine subclass that may simply wrap an existing implementation. A specialRelayEngine can be used to access Engines provided by another node runningRoutIR. –Processorsreceive search queries as input and perform actions before passing the queries to an Engine. By default, they are used to cache results and to batch queries that arrive in quick succession. –Pipelinesdescribe how engines are composed to produce a ranking. For ex- ample, a pipeline could indicate that results from two first-stage retrieval engines should be fused and then reranked. Pipelines can be composed of available Engines on the fly. 3.1 Retrieval Engines Each retrieval model or system should be wrapped as an Engine, which imple- ments the interface for serving queries. Each engine can provide one or more of the
