available services on each endpoint inserver importsare automat- ically relayed. This allows offloading computationally expensive models, such as LLM reranking, to another machine, while still enabling their integration with other services in the end user’s custom retrieval pipelines. Figure 3 demonstrates an example configuration JSON object. Each dictionary in theserviceslist defines a processor and its underlying Engine. The fieldenginespecifies the Engine class to initiate, which can be any of those included inRoutIRas built-in engines such asPLAIDX, or ones that are implemented by the user in a separate Python script. This is accomplished via RoutIR: Fast Serving of Retrieval Pipelines for RAG 9 1{ 2" s e r v e r _ i m p o r t s " : [ " http :// l oc al ho st :5000 " ] 3" f i l e _ i m p o r t s " : [ " ./ examples / r a n k 1 _ e x t e n s i o n . py " ] , 4" services " : [ 5{ 6" name " : " rank1 " , 7" engine " : " R a n k 1 E n g i n e " , 8" config " :{ } 9} 10{ 11" name " : " qwen3 - neuclir " , 12" engine " : " Qwen3 " , 13" b a t c h _ s i z e " : 16 , 14" config " :{ 15" i n d e x _ p a t h " : " hfds : routir / neuclir - qwen3 -8 b - faiss - P Q 2 0 4 8 x 4 f s " , 16" e m b e d d i n g _ m o d
