effectiveness and reliability as the back- bone for the 2025 JHU SCALE Workshop for more than 50 researchers and also as the search service for 2025 TREC RAGTIME Track. RoutIRis still under development with more features in the near term planned, including integration of LLM rerankers, Model Context Protocol (MCP) interface, and better resource management.RoutIRis completely open-sourced on GitHub and welcomes community feedback, feature requests, and pull re- quests.
