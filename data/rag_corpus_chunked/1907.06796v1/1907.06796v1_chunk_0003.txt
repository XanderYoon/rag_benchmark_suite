In [15], the authors propose a homography-based planar detection and tracking algorithm to estimate 6DoF camera poses. Recently, [4] used detected surfaces from an image retrieval pipeline to initialize depth from the surface map. [8] adopted gradient orientation for direct surface tracking. Correlation ﬁlters are also utilized to estimate rotation as well as scale for 4DoF tracking [11]. [12] built a planar ob- ject tracking dataset and surveyed some of the related work in planar tracking. [10] proposed a model selection algo- rithm to detect which model, homography, or essential ma- trix describes the motion better. 3. Instant motion tracking Our instant motion tracking system consists of a mo- tion analysis module, a region tracking module, and either a planar target tracking module for planar surfaces as shown in ﬁg. 1a, or a pose estimation module for calibration-free 6DoF tracking as shown in ﬁg. 1b. In this section, we will brieﬂy describe each of these modules. 3.1. Motion analysis The motion analysis module extracts and tracks features over time, classiﬁes them into foreground and background, and estimates a temporally coherent camera motion model. We create temporally consistent tracks by assigning each feature path a unique ID. We describe the camera motion by the highest degree of freedom model that can be ro- bustly computed, depending on number and distribution of features, ranging from a 2DoF translation model, to a 4DoF similarity model, and ﬁnally to an 8DoF homogra- phy model. The feature extraction and tracking can be done using standard methods, including ﬁnding good features to track [19].
