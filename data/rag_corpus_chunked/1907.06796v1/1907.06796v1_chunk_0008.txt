set by the user. With this parallelization, the system is fast and efﬁcient, can track moving or static regions, and further- more requires no calibration–it works on any device with a gyroscope. 4. Results and applications to AR In ﬁg. 3 we demonstrate planar target tracking results for a real-world image from two different perspectives. Note that the tracking is capable of producing an accurate 2D quadrilateral as well as the 3D local coordinate frame of the image. When the physical size of the image is provided, the rotation and translation will be accurate to real-world scale. In ﬁg. 4 we show an AR sticker effect powered by our calibration-free 6DoF tracking. This technology is driving major AR self-expression applications on mobile phones, achieving on average 27.5 FPS across 415+ distinct devices. 5. Conclusion In this paper, we present a system of instant motion tracking, enabling planar target tracking and relative-scale 6DoF tracking. Our system is calibration-free and robust to degenerate cases. It has been deployed on hundreds of millions of mobile devices, driving major AR applications.
