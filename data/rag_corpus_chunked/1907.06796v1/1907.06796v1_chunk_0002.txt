such as slow-moving cam- eras, pure rotations, planar scenes, and tracking distant ob- jects. Homographies, on the other hand, can accurately and robustly describe the motion in such cases [16, 10]. Accurate initialization improves the resilience of SLAM algorithms and makes optimization converge faster. Re- searchers have relied on Structure-from-Motion (SfM) tech- niques, e.g. rotation averaging [3, 7], or closed-form solu- tions [9] to initialize the camera trajectories and the world map. However, these techniques still require parallax- inducing motion and accurate calibration, rendering them problematic for instant AR placement. Planar trackers are widely used in SfM applications and panoramic image registration [21]. [16] studied planar tracking for augmented reality applications. Direct region tracking algorithms typically use a homography to warp an image patch from the template to the source and mini- mize the difference [5]. [6] proposed a region-based planar tracker using a second-order optimization method for min- imizing SSD errors. [17] is another region tracker using second-order optimization to minimize the sum of condi- tional variances. Lucas-Kanade and compositional track- ers [5] require re-evaluating the Hessian of the loss function 1 arXiv:1907.06796v1 [cs.CV] 16 Jul 2019 Motion Analysis Robust Region Tracking motion data framesregion to track Planar Target Tracking feature weights tracked quad 6DoF pose (a) Planar target tracking Motion Analysis Robust Region Tracking motion data framesregion to track Pose Estimation orientation sensor data translation, relative scale 6DoF pose with relative scale (b) 6DoF tracking Figure 1: A diagram of our instant motion tracking system. at every iteration. Inverse compositional trackers [5] speed up tracking by avoiding re-evaluation of the Hessian matrix. In [15], the authors propose a homography-based planar detection and tracking algorithm to estimate 6DoF camera poses. Recently, [4] used detected surfaces from an image retrieval pipeline to initialize depth from the surface map. [8] adopted
