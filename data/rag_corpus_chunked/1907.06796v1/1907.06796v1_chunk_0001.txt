accu- rate placement and rendering of virtual content in the real world. Augmentation using virtual content can be simply overlaying a 2D texture, or rendering complex 3D charac- ters into real scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel instant motion tracking system, based on robust feature tracking, as well as global and local motion estimation. With a shared motion analy- sis module, our system is capable of performing both planar target tracking and anchor region-based 6DoF tracking (us- ing a mobile device’s orientation sensor). Unlike SLAM, our system does not require calibration or initialization to introduce parallax. It is also amenable to tracking moving regions. By removing the need for calibration, it enables AR applications to be deployed at a large scale. By remov- ing the need for initialization, we can place AR content in- stantaneously (even on moving surfaces), without requiring users to translate their phones ﬁrst. Our main contributions are: • A system that is robust in the face of degenerate cases like planar scenes, no user motion, and pure rotation. • Calibration-free placement of AR components without a complex initialization procedure. • Real-time performance on mobile phones, serving mil- lions of users AR content across a wide range of mo- bile devices. 2. Related work Standard SLAM pipelines [20] require users to perform parallax-inducing motions, the so-called SLAM wiggle [3], to initialize the world map [14]. These systems can fail in the presence of degenerate cases, such as slow-moving cam- eras, pure rotations, planar scenes, and tracking distant ob- jects. Homographies, on the other hand, can accurately and robustly describe the motion in such cases [16, 10]. Accurate initialization improves the resilience of SLAM algorithms and makes optimization converge faster. Re- searchers have relied on Structure-from-Motion (SfM) tech- niques, e.g. rotation averaging [3, 7], or closed-form
