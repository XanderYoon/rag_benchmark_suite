region’s appearance since each fea- ture’s patch intensity stays roughly constant over time. Ad- ditionally, by decomposing a region’s motion into that of the camera motion and the individual object motion, we can even track featureless regions. An advantage of our architecture is that the motion anal- ysis yields a compact motion metadata over the full image, enabling great ﬂexibility and constant computation inde- pendent of the number of regions tracked. For example, we can easily track multiple regions simultaneously, and cache metadata across a batch of frames to quickly track regions both backwards and forwards in time; or even sync directly to a speciﬁed timestamp forrandom access tracking. 3.3. Planar target tracking Many object-centric AR use cases require tracking of planar targets to augment them with virtual objects. Exam- ples of planar targets include QR codes, AR markers, and image/texture targets. Unlike region tracking (discussed in section 3.2), planar target tracking is capable of provid- ing absolute orientation and absolute position–with known physical size. In this section, we propose a variant of the re- gion tracking algorithm tailored to tracking any planar tar- get with known shape (commonly, a rectangle) with high accuracy and resilience. For the sake of brevity, we limit Figure 3: Planar target tracking results from two different perspectives, with 3D local coordinates overlaid. our discussion to a rectangular-shaped planar target. The goal of planar target tracking is to estimate the image coordinates of the four corners of the target (a quadrilateral) across frames. In this scenario, a homography transforma- tion is commonly used to describe the inter-frame move- ment of the quadrilateral [16]. Speciﬁcally, a homography matrix is ﬁrst estimated from feature correspondences be- tween frames, and applied to update the position of the quadrilateral. While a homography has 8 degrees of free- dom, in
