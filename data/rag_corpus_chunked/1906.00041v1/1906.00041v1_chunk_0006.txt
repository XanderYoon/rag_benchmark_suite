candidate entities according to P(e |E). Candidate entity selection is done as in [14]. BL1 Entity similarity is measured based on the similarity of rela- tions of e, obtained from RDF triples, and those of the seed tables entities E. BL2 It uses the Wikipedia Link-based Measure [8] to estimate the semantic relatedness of entities based on their outgoing links (in the knowledge base). BL3 It relies on the Jaccard similarity between outgoing links of entities. 3.1.2 Using Table2Vec embeddings. Recall that we have two en- tity embeddings, Table2VecE and Table2VecE*. The former is trained on all entities contained in the table, while the latter considers only entities in the core column. Given that the row population task focuses on the core column, we employ the Table2VecE* embed- dings here. We measure the similarity of each candidate entity e, against the seed entities e ′ ∈ E, using the cosine similarity of their respective embedding vectors: sim(e, E) = 1 |E| Õ e ′ ∈E sim(e, e ′) = 1 |E| Õ e ′ ∈E ®ve · ®ve ′ ∥ ®ve ∥ ∥ ®ve ′ ∥ , (3) where |E| is the size of seed entity set, and ®ve and ®ve ′ are the embedding vectors of the candidate and seed entities, respectively. We then combine the baseline similarity with the Table2Vec- based similarity using the following linear mixture: P(e |E) =αPK B(e |E) + (1 −α) Pemb (e |E) , (4) where PKB is the similarity measured using the knowledge base and Pemb is based on table embeddings, and equals to Eq. (3). 3.2 Column Population Column population is the task of returning a ranked list of headings, l1, . . . ,lk , given a seed table T . The returned headings are ranked based on their relevance
