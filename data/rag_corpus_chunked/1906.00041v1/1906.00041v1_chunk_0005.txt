core column of the table, as is shown in Fig. 1d. 3 UTILIZING TABLE2VEC EMBEDDINGS In this section, we extend previous table population and retrieval methods by incorporating the Table2Vec embeddings that we in- troduced in Sect. 2. For all tasks, we keep our focus on relational Table 1: Table2Vec embeddings. Method Input Semantic repr. Table2VecW all table data word embeddings Table2VecH table headings heading embeddings Table2VecE all entities entity embeddings Table2VecE* core column entities entity embeddings tables. It is assumed that entities mentioned in the table are recog- nized and disambiguated by linking them to entries in a knowledge base [2]. The table population task is considered in two flavors: row population and column population. We shall refer to the input table T as seed table, in which the set of entities from the core column are referred as seed entities E, and the set of headings are denoted as seed headings L. 3.1 Row Population Row population is a task of returning a list of entities, based on their likelihood of being added to the core column of the seed table T in the next row. The ranking is established based on the similarity of a candidate entity e to the seed table entities E. In this task, we measure entity similarity by two approaches: using a knowledge base and using Table2Vec embeddings. 3.1.1 Baselines. We employ three probabilistic ranking methods from [14] as our baselines, which rank candidate entities according to P(e |E). Candidate entity selection is done as in [14]. BL1 Entity similarity is measured based on the similarity of rela- tions of e, obtained from RDF triples, and those of the seed tables entities E. BL2 It uses the Wikipedia Link-based Measure [8] to estimate the semantic relatedness of entities based on their outgoing links
