column population, and table retrieval. All three tasks are performed on relational tables, which describe a set of entities placed in a core column, along with their attributes in ad- ditional columns. Table population is the task of populating a given seed table with additional elements [9, 14]. Specifically, we address the row population and column population tasks proposed in [14]. The former aims to complement the core column of a relational table with additional entities, while the latter aims to complement Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

Table retrieval is the task of returning a ranked list of tables for a keyword query [15]. Prior table-related work has considered embeddings, both pre- trained ones and task-specific ones. For example, Zhang and Balog [15] use pre-trained word and entity embeddings for table retrieval. Ghasemi-Gol and Szekely [6] develop table embeddings for table classification and Gentile et al. [5] train table embeddings for web table entity matching. However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have been conducted on training table
