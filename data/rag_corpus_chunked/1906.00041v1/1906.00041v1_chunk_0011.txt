BL1, BL2, and BL3 are 0.4, 0.0, and 0.1, respectively. This means that the second baseline does not contribute at all to the combination. Overall, we find that the combined methods outperform the respective baselines substantially and significantly (p < 0.01). BL1 + Table2VecE* yields the best performance in terms of MAP. It is Table 3: Row population performance. Statistical significance is tested against the respective baseline. #Seed entities ( |E|) Method 1 2 3 4 5 MAP MRR MAP MRR MAP MRR MAP MRR MAP MRR BL1 0.4360 0.5552 0.4706 0.5846 0.4788 0.5856 0.4786 0.5779 0.4711 0.5618 BL2 0.2612 0.4779 0.2778 0.4887 0.2845 0.4811 0.2846 0.4808 0.2817 0.4689 BL3 0.2912 0.5024 0.3024 0.4927 0.3028 0.4815 0.2987 0.4780 0.2910 0.4609 BL1 + Table2VecE* 0.5581‡ 0.7414‡ 0.6147‡ 0.8141‡ 0.6400‡ 0.8424‡ 0.6524‡ 0.8427‡ 0.6533‡ 0.8372‡ BL2 + Table2VecE* 0.5461 ‡ 0.7710‡ 0.6027‡ 0.8317‡ 0.6187‡ 0.8440‡ 0.6217‡ 0.8389‡ 0.6223‡ 0.8410‡ BL3 + Table2VecE* 0.5487 ‡ 0.7728‡ 0.6049‡ 0.8294‡ 0.6218‡ 0.8482‡ 0.6249‡ 0.8435‡ 0.6251‡ 0.8395‡ Table 4: Column population performance.

This indicates the seed entities are better utilized in our embedding-based method.
