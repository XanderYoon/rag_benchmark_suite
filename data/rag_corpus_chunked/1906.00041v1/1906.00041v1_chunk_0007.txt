, (4) where PKB is the similarity measured using the knowledge base and Pemb is based on table embeddings, and equals to Eq. (3). 3.2 Column Population Column population is the task of returning a ranked list of headings, l1, . . . ,lk , given a seed table T . The returned headings are ranked based on their relevance to the seed headings L. Similarly to row population, we consider two heading similarity measures. 3.2.1 Baseline. The baseline method, using a table corpus, is taken from [14]. First, relevant tables are retrieved from the table corpus. Then, the probability of a candidate heading being relevant P(l |L) is estimated based on the occurrences of that heading in relevant tables. 3.2.2 Using Table2Vec embeddings. We use embeddings trained on table headings, Table2VecH, for heading relevance estimation. Similarly to row population, we measure the cosine similarity be- tween the embedding vectors of the candidate heading l and seed headings l ′ ∈ L. Then, the baseline estimate is combined with the embedding-based similarity using: P(l |L) =αPKB(l |L) + (1 −α) Pemb(l |L) . (5) 3.3 Table Retrieval Table retrieval is the task of returning a ranked list of tables in response to a keyword query q, based on their relevance to q. For this task, we employ a feature-based method as a baseline, which is referred to as the LTR method in [15]. We utilize the word-based and entity-based table embeddings, Table2VecW and Table2VecE, to compute additional semantic matching features. Specifically, each type of embedding contributes four features, for each of the similarity methods in [15]. Given that both the table and query are vectors now, we compute cosine similarity to measure relevance. For comparison purposes, we employ both methods in [15]: early fusion and late fusion. For the former
