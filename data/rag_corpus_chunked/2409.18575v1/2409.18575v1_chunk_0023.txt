facet recall of aligned models being slightly lower.6 At the same time, the drop in Recall of the facet that is removed from the evidence set (Δ𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 ) is much larger in aligned models, demonstrating substantially more faithful clarifications towards the evidence documents. This hints that previous question generators lack sufficient evidence grounding, which is essential for creating Corpus-informed Clarifications. 5.2.4 Increasing number of evidence documents. One of the main ad- vantages of Fusion-in-Decoder models over other encoder-decoder models is that they can take into account lengthier context when generating a response. In practice FiD models can be viewed as compressed encoder-decoders, which can model more evidence documents with the same GPU memory footprint. Here, we explore whether FiD can benefit from modelling more evidence documents when generating questions. Due to computational restrictions, in this experiment we reduce the Generation Length to 32 tokens instead of 64 and skip the question prediction using 𝐹𝑖𝐷 − 𝐴𝑠𝑝𝐺𝑒𝑛 . 6Note that since facets often include query words on mimics (eg. “Leiden zip code”) Term Overlap metrics remain relatively high.
