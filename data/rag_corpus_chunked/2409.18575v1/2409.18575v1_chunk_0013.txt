FiD-RevGen 𝑎, BART 𝑏 and the Faspects ensemble 𝑐 (paired T-test, 𝑝 − 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 < 0.05 and Bonferroni correction for multiple hypothesis testing). For metrics computed on the facet level (Set-BERT and Set-BLEU), we follow prior work and create the best matching pairs between 𝐹 and 𝐺 using the BLUE-1 score [9]. 4.2 Baselines Due to variations in (a) metric implementation, (b) BERT-Scores’ variability to package versions and (c) the use of different test sets3, reported results for a method often differ across papers, indicating a serious reproducibility issue [9, 29, 46]. To circumvent this issue and ensure a fair comparison, we only compare with publicly available baselines and use the evaluation code of Faspect[29]4. We compare with 𝐵𝐴𝑅𝑇, a SOTA encoder-decoder aspect extrac- tion model that uses queries and evidence documents to generate facets from [29]. In comparison with our FiD models, BART is more heavy computationally, since its encoder computes cross-attentions between the evidence documents. Additionally, we compare with Faspect [29], a strong Recall-optimised ensemble model that relies on multiple diverse models for generating facets. Those models include the BART baseline we used here, as well as other Sequence Labelling, Extreme Facet Classification or Unsupervised Facet ex- traction methods. Ensembling is done using the Round-Robin algo- rithm [29], that practically interleaves results coming from different models until generating the maximum amount of facets ( 5). We do not compare with baselines that focus on optimising the train- ing objectives for generating set-based predictions, since those are orthogonal to our work and beyond the scope of this paper [21]. 4.3 Implementation details We initialize the question generator (FiD) model from an𝐴𝑡𝑙𝑎𝑠 −𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒 checkpoint, which is pretrained with an unsupervised language modelling objective and exhibits good few-shot abilities
