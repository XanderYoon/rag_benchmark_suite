highlights the gap between ground truth facets and those present in existing ranking corpora, calling for the need of datasets that can support generating Corpus-Informed clarifica- tions. Future work should focus in developing appropriate train and test collections that better reflect the objective of creating Corpus-Informed Clarifying Questions. Novelty and diversity of the evidence pool remains important for generating good questions. To this end, exploring probabilistic retrieval methods [37, 39], and combining them with retriever training techniques, such as reader distillation remains a promising direction.
