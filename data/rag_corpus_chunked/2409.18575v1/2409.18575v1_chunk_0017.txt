can successfully utilise all evidence documents towards the generation. Lastly, we perform closed-book generation (without using evidence passages), we observe a big drop across performance metrics. By manual inspection, we observe that closed-book models are able to generate facet words for some queries, while they often resort in capturing reoccurring patterns from the training set (eg. on shopping related queries: “Are you shopping for:𝑚𝑒𝑛, 𝑤𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑛 , 𝑘𝑖𝑑𝑠 ?”). Our results in this Section suggest thatRAG models and in partic- ular FiD can be used to effectively and efficiently model the retrieval corpus and generate clarifying questions end-to-end. Overall, we answer RQ1 positively and conclude that Retrieval- Augmented-Generation models such as FiD are effective in jointly modelling the query, collection and generating clarifying ques- tions in an end-to-end way. We find that thoseFiD is competitive with more computationally expensive baselines such as BART, sug- gesting that it can be effectively used to model larger parts of the collection and therefore generate more informed clarifying ques- tions. Further, we verify the finding of previous works [ 29, 32] that evidence documents are crucial for generating good clarify- ing questions and strengthen our motivation towards performing Corpus-informed Clarifying Question Generation .

Our hypothesis here is that if evidence documents and ground truth facets are not aligned during training, that is if ground truth
