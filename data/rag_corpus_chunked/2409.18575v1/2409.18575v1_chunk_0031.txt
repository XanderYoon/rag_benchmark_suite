with the finding that many of the facets are irretrievable (Table 2) suggests that current test collections and evaluation frameworks are not suitable for evaluating Corpus- Informed clarifying question generation. Qualitative analysis. In Table 8 we analyse a handful of random queries, presenting their ground-truth and generated facets. We show facets generated by our aligned model (train. evidence:Contr- FT|Q,F), and tested in an open-domain setting without diversi- fication (test evidence: Contr-FT|Q)(second-to-last row of Table Re-occurring patterns Example query type: [facets] software-related: [operating system] media creation tool: windows [10,7,8] shopping query: [review, manual, specs, for sale] huawei phones: [manual, specs, battery, review, accessories] location: [hotels, restaurants, population] jersey city: [restaurants, hotels, population, homes for sale] location: [zip code, weather, things to do] leiden: [things to do, weather, zip code, what time is it] movieor series: [cast, trailer, quotes, review] her alibi movie: [cast, trailer, review, quotes] medical condition: [symptom, treatment, causes, diagnosis] adhd: [symptom, treatment, causes, diagnosis, diet] act: [checklist, tips, hacks] getting a kitten: [tips, checklist, life hacks, pros] various: [men, women, kids] short layered hairstyles: [women, men, teens, kids] Dataset percentage:20.74% Table 7: Reoccurring facet patterns in the MIMICS dataset 5). Firstly, we observe that even the model trained with align- ment learns to reproduce common re-occurring facet patterns from the training set (eg. “windows 7,8,10”). In fact, this still happens when evidence documents are unrelated to those facet patterns, as only 2/10 evidence documents mention operating systems versions, while the topic of the documents is not specifically related to those. Another observation that stands out is that the ground-truth facets are not exhaustive and other equally good or better facets can be generated. Such examples include episodes of penny appearing in the big bang theory, or referring to the leiden thrombophilia disorder rather than aspects related to the
