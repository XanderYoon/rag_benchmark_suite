include many different components (eg. keyword extraction, generation) that work in a disconnected way from each other. Last there is work that focuses on enhancing the training of au- toregressive models for generating clarification facets, which are by nature unordered. Next token prediction objectives could unfairly penalize the models for predicting facets in a different ordering. To tackle this, Hashemi et al. [10] generate all possible permutations of facets and backpropagate the minimum loss during training. Ni et al. [21] does a thorough comparison of training objectives and conclude that training on one-facet-at-a-time basis increases per- formance but hurts facet diversity. This work is orthogonal to ours and can also be applied to our models. 3 METHODOLOGY Problem definition. In this work we investigate the problem of clarifying question generation for Web Search, where clarifying questions are presented through a clarification pane in the Search Engine Result Page (SERP). In this setting, the user has a search intent 𝑔𝑖 ∈ 𝐺 and searches for a set of relevant documents 𝑅𝑖 in a corpus of documents 𝐶. To express his information need 𝑔𝑖, the user issues an ambiguous or faceted query 𝑞 to the search engine. The SERP presents the top ranking results along with a clarification pane that tries to clarify the ambiguity of 𝑞. The clarification pane consists of a clarifying question 𝐶𝑄 and some potential answers 𝐹 to this clarifying question 𝐶𝑄. Those answers are basically possible search intents, facets or aspects of query 𝑞. The goal of asking a good clarification question becomes directly related to finding the possible search intents (facets) 𝐹 that query 𝑞 engulfs. To find such search intents 𝐹, it is important to take into account the document collection 𝐶 the user searches through. In failing to do so, we risk presenting search
