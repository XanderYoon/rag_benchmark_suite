finetuning the retriever jointly with the reader, using knowledge distillation from the ground truth facets. As usual, the retriever is initialised from the checkpoint finetuned on MSMarco. For initialising the reader, we have two different variants: 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟 − 𝐹𝑇 − 𝑇 𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 is initialised directly from the Atlas checkpoint, pre-trained with the unsupervised Masked Language Modelling objective, while 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟 −𝐹𝑇 −𝑇 𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 −𝑊 𝑎𝑟𝑚𝑒𝑑𝑈 𝑝 is initialised from [𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟 −𝐹𝑇 |𝑄]. We observe that directly finetuning a reader and retriever from the Atlas checkpoint has a detrimental effect on performance, which may be because the reader has to first learn how to adapt the gener- ation task, from the unsupervised Masked Language Modelling ob- jective used in pretraining to the task of Clarifying Question gener- ation. However, when we initialise the model from[𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟 − 𝐹𝑇 |𝑄], training the retriever for diversification has a slight positive im- pact on certain performance metrics, particularly the semantic 𝑆𝑒𝑡 − 𝐵𝐸𝑅𝑇 and 𝑆𝑒𝑡 − 𝐵𝑙𝑢𝑒 metrics. In the rest of the metrics, per- formance remains at worst competitive with [𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟 − 𝐹𝑇 |𝑄], ie. the model we initialised from. We conclude that training the retriever with knowledge distil- lation from the reader can have a slight positive impact in per- formance, yet bringing up documents related to the ground truth facets remains a challenge in this dataset and task. 6 ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION Implications of Taxonomy Bias. Our preliminary qualitative analysis suggested that certain query-facet patterns are heavily repeated within the MIMICS dataset. This can be attributed to the dataset construction process, during which facets were extracted based on search engine query logs and a taxonomy defined by the authors. To detect such patterns, we extract the top-20 frequent facet words (excluding stop-words) and inspect a couple of queries containing them. Based on those,
