Superscripts 𝑎,𝑏,𝑐 indicate significant improvements wrt. best model from each category (paired T-test, 𝑝 − 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 < 0.05 and Bonferroni correction for multiple hypothesis testing. Best results across group are boldfaced. single ranking), the alignment statistics almost double. However, even in this case and when performing lexical retrieval (𝐵𝑀 25|𝑄, 𝐹 ), a large number of facet words ( ∼ 20%) are still absent from the evidence pool. This shows that many facets in this dataset might be irretrievable or not even existing, creating a shortcoming in terms of model training (possible hallucinations) and also in terms of evaluation and result reliability. 5.2.2 Effect of retriever in generation performance. In Table 3 we use these different evidence pools to explore how they affect down- stream performance. It is evident that aligning evidence and gen- eration (∗|𝑄, 𝐹 ) during training and inference brings a big boost and significant performance improvements across metrics. Most notably
