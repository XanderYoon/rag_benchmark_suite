our experiments on the MIMICS dataset. Our choice is based on a number of factors, namely: (a) the presen- tation of clarifying questions that happens via a clarification pane on a SERP. In our view, this presentation is less intrusive than a conversational system that interrupts the user’s journey without presenting results to ask a question, and hence less likely to harm user experience [ 4], and (b) a more straightforward and robust evaluation method that directly evaluates generated facets [ 14]. In contrast, the QuLaC [2] evaluation framework involves a user answering the clarifying question and ranking documents to judge question quality. However, evaluation can be particularly noisy, since both of these parts are challenging. User answers largely de- pend on their cooperativeness [31], while ranking documents with clarification-based queries is particularly challenging [14]. Following prior work on 𝑀𝐼 𝑀𝐼𝐶𝑆 , we train on 𝑀𝐼 𝑀𝐼𝐶𝑆 − 𝐶𝑙𝑖𝑐𝑘 and test on 𝑀𝐼 𝑀𝐼𝐶𝑆 − 𝑀𝑎𝑛𝑢𝑎𝑙 [9, 10, 29]. Evaluation metrics. Following previous research [9, 10, 29, 46], we focus on a number of lexical and semantic metrics that measure overlap of generated facets to the ground truth ones. Given a se- quence of ground truth facets, 𝐺 = 𝑔1, 𝑔2, 𝑔𝑛, and a sequence of generated facets, 𝐹 = 𝑓1, 𝑓2, ..., 𝑓𝑚, we assess aspect generation qual- ity using: • Term Overlap (𝑃, 𝑅, 𝐹 1): measures lexical overlap at the word level, i.e. overlap between words in 𝐺 and 𝐹. • Exact Match (𝑃, 𝑅, 𝐹 1): measures exact lexical match at the facet level, i.e. whether 𝑓𝑖 = 𝑔𝑗 . • Set-BERT [9]: measures semantic overlap at the facet level based on BERT-score [43] • Set-BLEU-ngram[9, 23]: measures n-gram overlap at the facet level 2https://huggingface.co/facebook/contriever https://huggingface.co/facebook/contriever-msmarco Model Co-Gen Term Overlap Exact Match Set-BERT Set-BLEU Prec.
