continuously adapts its ranking algorithms based on the feedback received from the user and the insights provided by the other agents in the system. Feedback Agent.This agent gathers implicit and explicit feed- back during and after user interactions. Implicit feedback includes behavioral data like time spent on documents, click counts, and navigation patterns. Explicit feedback involves direct user input on document relevance and quality, collected through ratings, surveys, or comments. The agent uses this information to train and refine models for other agents, particularly the Document Ranking Agent. This process enhances the system’s ability to anticipate user needs and deliver relevant documents based on accumulated feedback and insights. By dynamically integrating insights from the User Profile Agent, Contextual Retrieval Agent, Live Session Agent, Document Ranking Agent, and Feedback Agent into the IR processes, PersonaRAG not only adapts to immediate user needs but also evolves over time to better anticipate and meet user expectations. This multi-agent approach enables PersonaRAG to embody a truly adaptive and user- focused information retrieval system, leveraging specialized agents to analyze user interactions from different behavioral perspectives and deliver highly personalized and contextually relevant search experiences. The inclusion of the Document Ranking Agent ensures that the most pertinent documents are identified and presented to users, further enhancing the system’s ability to effectively satisfy user information needs. 3.3 PersonaRAG Operational Workflow The PersonaRAG framework employs a structured workflow that al- lows for sequential and parallel processing of tasks, ensuring clarity and consistency in communication between agents through well- defined data structures and protocols [ 12]. The process involves the User Profile Agent, Contextual Retrieval Agent, Live Session Agent, Document Ranking Agent, and Feedback Agent working together to refine search queries, prioritize relevant results, and improve document scoring and re-ranking based on user profile, session-specific contexts, and feedback.
