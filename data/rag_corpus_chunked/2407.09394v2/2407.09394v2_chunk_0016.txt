to dynamically adjust search results or recommend new queries in real-time, ensuring that session adjustments align with user preferences and goals. Document Ranking Agent. Your task is to help the Document Ranking Agent prioritize documents for better ranking. Question:{question} Passages:{passages} Global Memory:{global_memory} Task Description: Analyze the retrieved passages and global memory pool to identify ways to rank documents effectively. Focus on combining historical user preferences, immediate needs, and session behavior to refine ranking algorithms. Your insights should ensure that documents presented by the Document Ranking Agent are prioritized to match user interests and search context. Feedback Agent. You are an expert in feedback collection and analysis, guiding the Feedback Agent to gather and utilize user insights. Question:{question} Passages:{passages} Global Memory:{global_memory} Task Description: Using the retrieved passages and global memory pool, identify methods for collecting implicit and explicit user feedback. Suggest ways to refine feedback mechanisms to align with user preferences, such as ratings, surveys, or behavioral data. Your recommendations should guide the Feedback Agent in updating other agents’ models for more personalized and relevant results. Global Message Pool. You are responsible for maintaining and enriching the Global Message Pool, serving as a central hub for inter-agent communication. Question:{question} Agent Responses:{agent_responses} Existing Global Memory:{global_memory} Task Description: Using the responses from individual agents and the existing global memory, consolidate key insights into a shared repository. Your goal is to organize a comprehensive message pool that includes agent-specific findings, historical user preferences, session-specific behaviors, search queries, and user feedback. This structure should provide all agents with meaningful data points and strategic recommendations, reducing redundant communication and improving the system’s overall efficiency. 4.5.2 Prompts Used in Cognitive Dynamic Adaptation.
