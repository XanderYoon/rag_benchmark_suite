In contrast, the PersonaRAG method provides notable perfor- mance improvements: over 8% for LLaMA3-70B and more than 10% for MoE-8x7b across all datasets, underscoring its effectiveness. The PersonaRAG methodology distinguishes itself from the Chain- of-Note approach by offering a cognitive framework that connects retrieved passages with prior knowledge. This framework models the instructor’s (GPT-3.5) reasoning process, guiding the student models (LLaMA3-70B and MoE-8x7b) to better understand knowl- edge retrieved from passages. The results demonstrate that the LLMs are capable of selecting appropriate passages to build more accurate responses, highlighting the benefits of the PersonaRAG approach for improving generalization. 5.4 Case Study Finally, we randomly sample one case in Table to demonstrate the effectiveness of PersonaRAG. The user interaction analysis mechanism effectively generates comprehensive results by integrating foundational and advanced insights from user data. Retrieved passages provide critical clues for answering questions, while agent analyses summarize and illustrate PersonaRAG: Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems with User-Centric Agents , Question:Who stole the Mona Lisa from the Louvre in 1911?
