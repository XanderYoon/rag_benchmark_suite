the same retriever, a term-based sparse retrieval model known as BM25 [ 26], is used across all different models. The retrieval model is implemented using the OpenMatch toolkit [38]. For the external document corpus, the KILT-Wikipedia corpus preprocessed by Petroni et al . [25] is used, and the top-k relevant documents are retrieved. Regarding the LLMs used to generate answers, the Llama 3 model instruct (ref) with 70b parameters, Mixture of Experts (MoE) 8x7b (ref), and the GPT-3.5 model(gpt-3.5-turbo-0125) are employed. For the retrieval-augmented LLM design, the implementation de- tails from Trivedi et al . [33] are followed, which include input prompts, instructions, and the number of test samples for evalua- tion (e.g., 500 samples per dataset). 4.5 Prompts Used in PersonaRAG This subsection presents the prompt templates employed in the construction of the PersonaRAG model. The prompts utilized in the User Interaction Analysis and Cognitive Dynamic Adaptation com- ponents are detailed below. The prompt templates used by the base- line models are available in the project repository1. In the templates, {question} represents the input question, {global_memory} the Global Message Pool, while {passages} denotes the retrieved pas- sages. Additionally, {cot_answer} is populated with the output generated by the Chain-of-Thought model. The placeholder {user_profile_answer} is filled with the re- sponse produced by the User Profile agent model. Respectively, {contextual_answer} corresponds to the Contextual Retrieval agent model, {live_session_answer} to the Live Session agent model, {document_ranking_answer} to the Document Ranking agent model, and{feedback_answer} to the Feedback agent model. 1https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PersonaRAG-F423 , Zerhoudi et al. 4.5.1 Prompts Used in User Interaction Analysis.
