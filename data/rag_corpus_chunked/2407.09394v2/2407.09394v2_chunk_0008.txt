more dynamic context-aware system that can consider broader aspects of the query environment. It utilizes user profile data to modify and refine search queries or to prioritize search results. For instance, if a user consistently engages more with certain types of documents or topics, the retrieval agent can boost those document types in the search results, ensuring that the most relevant information is presented to the user. Live Session Agent.This agent analyzes the current session in real-time, observing user actions such as clicks, time spent on documents, modifications to the query, and any feedback provided. It creates a session-specific context model that captures the user’s immediate needs and interests. The real-time data collected by this agent is used to adjust the ongoing session, potentially re- ranking search results or suggesting new queries based on the user’s behavior and preferences. Additionally, the Live Session Agent updates the user profile with new insights gleaned from the session, allowing for a more personalized and efficient search experience in future interactions. Document Ranking Agent.This agent is responsible for re- ranking the documents retrieved by the Contextual Retrieval Agent. It integrates insights from both the User Profile Agent and the Live Session Agent to score and order the documents more effectively. By considering the user’s historical preferences and their current session behavior, the Document Ranking Agent ensures that the most relevant and valuable documents are presented to the user in a prioritized manner. This agent continuously adapts its ranking algorithms based on the feedback received from the user and the insights provided by the other agents in the system. Feedback Agent.This agent gathers implicit and explicit feed- back during and after user interactions. Implicit feedback includes behavioral data like time spent on documents, click counts, and navigation patterns. Explicit feedback involves direct user input on
