syllable count across RAG configurations provided insights into the system’s abil- ity to adapt responses to user comprehension levels. These obser- vations highlight PersonaRAG’s capacity to synthesize knowledge from various perspectives and tailor responses to different levels of user expertise. 5.3 Analysis on Generalization Ability This experiment evaluates the quality of knowledge construction using different large language models (LLMs).

Table 3, the PersonaRAG outcomes are used to prompt open-source LLMs, specifically LLaMA3-70B and MoE-8x7b, to generate accurate answers. Compared to LLMs without retrieval-augmented generation (w/o RAG), vanilla RAG and Chain-of-Note often exhibit lower performance. This result suggests that retrieved passages can act as noise, adversely affecting model performance even after refinement through note generation.
