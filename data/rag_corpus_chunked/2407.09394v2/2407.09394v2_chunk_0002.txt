that extends traditional RAG frameworks by incorporating user-centric agents into the retrieval process. This approach ad- dresses the previously mentioned limitations by promoting active engagement with retrieved content and utilizing dynamic, real- time user data to continuously refine and personalize interactions. PersonaRAG aims to enhance the precision and relevance of LLM outputs, adapting dynamically to user-specific needs while main- taining full transparency regarding the personalization process. Our experiments, conducted using GPT-3.5, develop the Person- aRAG model and evaluate its performance across various question answering datasets. The results indicate that PersonaRAG achieves an improvement of over 5% in accuracy compared to baseline mod- els. Furthermore, PersonaRAG demonstrates an ability to adapt responses based on user profiles and information needs, enhancing the personalization of results. Additional analysis shows that the principles underlying PersonaRAG can be generalized to different LLM architectures, such as Llama 3 70b and Mixture of Experts (MoE) 8x7b [15]. These architectures benefit from the integration of external knowledge facilitated by PersonaRAG, with improve- ments exceeding 10% in some cases. This evidence indicates that PersonaRAG not only contributes to the progress of RAG systems but also provides notable advantages for various LLM applications, signifying a meaningful step forward in the development of more intelligent and user-adapted information retrieval systems. 2 Related Work Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have emerged as a significant advancement in natural language processing and machine learning, enhancing language models by integrating ex- ternal knowledge bases to improve performance across various tasks, such as question answering, dialog understanding, and code generation [20, 37]. These systems employ dense retrievers to pull relevant information, which the language model then uses to gener- ate responses. However, the development of RAG systems and their integration within broader artificial intelligence frameworks is an ongoing area of research, with several challenges and opportunities for
