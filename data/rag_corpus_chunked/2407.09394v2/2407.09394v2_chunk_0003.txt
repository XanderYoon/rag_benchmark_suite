performance across various tasks, such as question answering, dialog understanding, and code generation [20, 37]. These systems employ dense retrievers to pull relevant information, which the language model then uses to gener- ate responses. However, the development of RAG systems and their integration within broader artificial intelligence frameworks is an ongoing area of research, with several challenges and opportunities for improvement. Recent developments in RAG systems have focused on refining these models to better handle the noise and irrelevant informa- tion often retrieved during the process. Xu et al . [37] addressed this issue by employing natural language inference models to se- lect pertinent sentences, thereby enhancing the RAG’s robustness. Additionally, advancements have been made in adaptively retriev- ing information, with systems like those proposed by Jiang et al . [16] dynamically fetching passages that are most likely to improve generation accuracy. Despite these improvements, RAG systems still face limitations, particularly in adapting their output to the user’s specific profile, such as their information needs or intellectual knowledge. This limitation stems from the current design of most RAG systems, which do not typically incorporate user context or personalized information retrieval strategies [40]. Consequently, there exists a gap between the general effectiveness of RAG systems and their applicability in personalized user experiences, where context and individual user preferences play a crucial role. Personalization in information retrieval is increasingly recog- nized as essential for enhancing user interaction and satisfaction [11]. Techniques such as user profiling, context-aware retrieval, and adap- tive feedback mechanisms are commonly employed to tailor search results to individual users’ needs. For instance, Jeong et al . [14] proposed adaptive retrieval strategies that dynamically adjust the retrieval process based on the complexity of the query and the user’s historical interaction data. These personalized approaches not only improve user satisfaction but
