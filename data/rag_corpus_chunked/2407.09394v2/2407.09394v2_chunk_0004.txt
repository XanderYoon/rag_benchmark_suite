as user profiling, context-aware retrieval, and adap- tive feedback mechanisms are commonly employed to tailor search results to individual users’ needs. For instance, Jeong et al . [14] proposed adaptive retrieval strategies that dynamically adjust the retrieval process based on the complexity of the query and the user’s historical interaction data. These personalized approaches not only improve user satisfaction but also increase the efficiency of information retrieval by reducing the time users spend sifting through irrelevant information. The integration of personalized techniques with agent-based systems provides a promising pathway to augment the capabilities of RAG systems. Agent-based systems, particularly in the form of LLM-Based Multi-Agent Frameworks [21], enable the simulation of complex interactions that can lead to more nuanced and contex- tually appropriate outputs. By incorporating multi-agent systems into RAG frameworks, there is potential for developing more robust and adaptive retrieval mechanisms that can handle a broader range of queries and generate more accurate responses, closely tailored to the specific needs and contexts of individual users. In conclusion, while significant progress has been made in en- hancing the effectiveness and personalization of RAG systems, ongoing research is crucial to address their existing limitations and expand their applications. The integration of personalized in- formation retrieval and agent-based enhancements represents a promising avenue for further enhancing the adaptability and accu- racy of RAG systems, potentially leading to intelligent information retrieval tailored to the specific needs of users. 3 Methodology In this section, we present the methodology underlying our Per- sonaRAG approach, which aims to enhance the ability of Language Large Models (LLMs) to actively engage with, understand, and lever- age user profile information for personalized content generation. We begin by discussing the fundamental concepts of Retrieval- Augmented Generation (RAG) models (Section 3.1) and then intro- duce our PersonaRAG technique, which encourages LLMs
