system capabilities to deliver personalized, context-aware responses with the intrinsic cognition of LLMs. Furthermore, PersonaRAG demonstrates effectiveness in lever- aging external knowledge and adapting responses based on user profiles, knowledge levels, and information needs to support LLMs in generation tasks without fine-tuning. However, this approach requires multiple calls to the LLM’s API, which can introduce addi- tional time latency and increase API calling costs when addressing questions. The process involves constructing the initial Chain-of- Thought, processing the User Interaction Agents results, and execut- ing the Cognitive Dynamic Adaptation to generate the final answer. Furthermore, the inputs to LLMs in this approach tend to be lengthy due to the inclusion of extensive retrieved passages and the incor- poration of user needs, interests, and profile construction results. These factors can impact the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the PersonaRAG approach in practical applications of Information Retrieval (IR) systems. Future research will aim to optimize the process by reducing API calls and developing concise representations of user profiles and retrieved information without compromising response quality. We also plan to explore more user-centric agents to better capture writing styles and characteristics of RAG users/searchers. This will enhance the system’s ability to understand and adapt to individual preferences, improving personalization and relevance in IR tasks.
