a dynamic haptic environment where the physical layout adopts to a virtual one [6, 15, 57]. In addition, previous work investigating “vection”, or “illusions of self-motion” study how to convincingly simulate human locomotion in virtual environments without having to allow for full physical movement of the user [46,47]. RDR, on the other hand, looks at the problem from the perspective of inducing the full physical movement of the user without explicit guidance systems or instructions. Therefore, we designed a system to in- duce movement patterns in user locomotion without informing them about the desired movement pattern, meaning participants were only instructed to move around freely in the environment. Inspired by these earlier studies, our work embraces the situated physical reality and our senses within it in our mixed reality experience. Through our proof of concept and user study, we demonstrate how to subtly manipulate user locomotion in AR space.

To overcome these issues of disengagement, creative measures are taken to redirect attention and enable redirected walk- ing [40, 44, 52, 56] through procedurally generated virtual space from 3D reconstructed physical space [48, 51]. Event-based meth- ods, such as dynamic saccadic redirection, have showcased a way to reduce the space required for immersive experiences [55]. Remixed Reality [28] explores the direct manipulation of the environment by offering users different and larger room layout options from their perspective. To further extend virtual space through augmentation and remote user presence, Room2Room [41] presented a prototype
