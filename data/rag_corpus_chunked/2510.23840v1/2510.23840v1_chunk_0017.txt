During the stimulus segments, the room elevates from and descends to the base ground level. • Distortion treatment 5 (Enlarge) refers to a geometric layout transformation of a room that enlarges and compresses. Users experience this as the walls moving away from or coming closer to them. This is called the Expansion Distortion and, like for Elevate, the treatment is designed to have a central gathering or dispersion effect. The Enlarge Distortion consists of two segments: virtual room ’enlarge’ and ’compress’. The room enlarges to double the width, length and height while expanding its volume from 56.82 m3 to 454.56 m3. 4 EXPERIMENT We recruited 20 participants, ages 23 to 32, of which eight identi- fied as male and twelve identified as female. Four participants had previously tried VR while only two previously experienced AR. On average, the study lasted approximately 30 minutes, including the time needed for the instruction, and consisted of seven trials and a 10-minute interview. We conducted one trial for each distortion treatment and two additional baseline trials: no treatment with parti- cles and without particles. The RDR system described in 3.1 System Infrastructure is used in a room environment that is approximately 4.5m × 5.5m × 2.5m (Fig.2). Based on dominant results from prior work in Spatial AR that highlight creative ways to interact with ex- tended reality, and the ways that participants responded to controlled and comprehensive space, we defined the following hypotheses: • H1: The augmented distortion treatment can induce partici- pants to move more in some directions than others. • H2: The augmented distortion treatment can induce partici- pants to move closer to or away from the center of the room. • H3: The augmented distortion treatment can induce partici- pants to turn or move in a circular direction. 4.1 Procedure Participants
