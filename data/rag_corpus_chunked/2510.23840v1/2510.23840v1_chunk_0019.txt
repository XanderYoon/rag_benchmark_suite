time if they felt discomfort (i.e. sickness, fright). A researcher remained outside of the room to monitor participants through the 3D reconstructed live inspector. After each 60-second trial, we turned off the projection and asked the participants to sit in the center seat of the couch. In between trials, we asked a few questions about their experience to ensure the participant felt okay and ready to continue. Before moving to the next trial, we asked if they could describe in a few words what they saw and experienced. After the final trial, participants were asked to reflect on their experience of each treatment and safety concern. Finally, each participant was compensated with a $10 gift card. Figure 6: The room transformation process during active distortion treatment, using the Expansion Distortion as shown above. During the “Apply” segments, the virtual room enlarges for 10 seconds. This is immediately followed by the “Return” segments, where the virtual room is compressed for 10 seconds until the virtually extended space merges back to the original room layout. Figure 7: The two location density maps, shown above, reflect data collected from twenty users during each segment: (a) Enlarge (apply phase) and (b) Compress (return phase). As shown in the timeline, collections are taken from two 4-second intervals: 2 seconds after and 2 seconds before the end of each phase of “Apply” and “Return”. This shows how floor space was utilized immediately before and after the end of each phase. 5 RESULTS The experimental design (Fig. 5) of this study intended to evalu- ate the changes in users’ positions before and after the geometric transformation in the Spatial Augmented Reality room due to the application of distortion treatments. In this section, we report two types of Distortion Effects, with three distortion treatments designed for directional effect,
