and Apply Group is t value = -7.747, p-value < 0.001. The differ- ence between Baseline Group and Return Group is t value=-8.924, p-value < 0.01. The difference between Return Group and Apply Group istvalue=-13.948,p-value<0.001. Each stimulus segment was tracked from apply and return, re- spectively. The movement of the axis for each group is analyzed as shown in the Fig. 11. The average value of the return and apply seg- ment is different for each group of the Elongation Distortion, Warp Distortion, and Shift Distortion. Based on mean distance moved, the Shift Distortion resulted in the largest directional user movement, followed by the Warp Distortion, and the Elongation Distortion. 5.3 Central Effect: Distance to Center We analyzed the average movement change of the user throughout the 10-second distortion segments by comparing their position in the room before and after the segments. In other words, we measured the displacement of the user during the 10-second interval. Out of the five distortion treatments, two of them were designed and tested to manipulate the user’s position relative to the distance from the center of the room. During the application stimulus segment, users generally moved away from the center, whereas during the return stimulus segment, users tended to move toward the center of the Figure 9: Users’ movements on the axis of consideration corresponding to the effect applied to the room. The chart shows data points (vertical lines) from each stimulus segment from 20 participants. Each vertical line shows data points denoting the average movement made in the axis direction over a 10-second period. We show stimulus segments among four conditions (Baseline, Elongation Distortion, Warp Distortion and Shift Distortion). Visible trends of users’ axis movement in the apply/return phase of three groups of distortion treatments become apparent by comparing with the baseline condition
