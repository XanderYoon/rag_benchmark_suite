the stimulus segments, while the Warp Distortion treatment showed the biggest positive axis movement when the room is being warped. This is likely due to users trying to get a better vantage point to see the end of the hallway and get a better idea of what is happening in their surroundings. The Elongation Distortion had the weakest effect, but when comparing each stimulus segment to the baseline segment, the treatment still worked with the shortest mean average distance effect to axis. Of the two central effects, the Enlarged Distortion exhibited the most prominent distance-to-center effect before and after the stimulus segments. Only one participant removed themselves from the study, to an- swer a phone call. No participant requested a break during the distortion treatment augmentation or expressed sickness during our study. Participants’ responses to Elevation Distortion showed a gen- erally negative sentiment, stating that “it took some time for me to understand what was happening” (P4) and “it was apparent when the room was going up but when the room was going down I wasn’t convinced” (P17). In contrast, many participants expressed that the Enlarge Distortion was fun and refreshing: “The room gradually ex- panding in all directions was my favorite” (P13) and “I felt like I was floating in space” (P14). Two participants requested to experience the Enlargement Distortion again after the study. In contrast to these many positive experiences, a few participants bumped into objects during the enlarge stimulus segment. Lastly, most participants found particles in the space to be a nice addition, stating it “magical”and “fun to interact with” (P5). 6.1 Limitations Reality Distortion Room demonstrates a visual perception locomo- tion aid designed for the purpose of safety, entertainment, and inter- action.
