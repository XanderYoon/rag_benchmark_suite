the existence of particles increases walking distance ( p< 0.001). The raincloud plot shows user distribution of TWD result and box indicating the median and interquartile range (IQR). p-value was less than 0.001 demonstrating a statistically significant difference between the “No particle” group and the “With particles” group. 5.2 Directional Effect: Axis Movement The following reports the directional effects of the three distortion treatments we designed and tested. We evaluated the 10-second user movement along axis direction within each stimulus segment. As seen from the data point of Fig.9, we saw a clear signal and trend between each stimulus segment and baseline. “Baseline” shows point data generated from 20 participants’ baseline trials (no distor- tion treatment + particles) in two 10-second intervals throughout the trial. In the apply stimulus segment, users tend to move toward the positive axis direction (refer to Fig. 2 for axis directions), while moving in the opposite direction for the return stimulus segment. The experimental group was classified by Baseline Group, Apply Group, and Return Group and the ANOV A analysis showed signifi- cant differences between the three. In the ANOV A table between the three groups, the F value was 198.329, and the p-value < 0.00005, showing a statistically significant difference in the size of apply segment and return segment. Post hoc analysis using Bonferroni adjustment also showed a significant difference in the mean between the three groups as follows. The difference between Baseline Group and Apply Group is t value = -7.747, p-value < 0.001. The differ- ence between Baseline Group and Return Group is t value=-8.924, p-value < 0.01. The difference between Return Group and Apply Group istvalue=-13.948,p-value<0.001. Each stimulus segment was tracked from apply and return, re- spectively. The movement of the axis for each group is analyzed as shown in the
