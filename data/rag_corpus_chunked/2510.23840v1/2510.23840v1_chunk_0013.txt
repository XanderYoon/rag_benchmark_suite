distorting. The same concept was applied to the two distortion treatments that influenced the user’s distance to the center of the room. When de- signing the floor layout of the distortion treatment we made sure the virtual space did not transform any smaller than the physical walkable space, presenting the full room layout for users to walk around without being able to step out from the virtually rendered space. Each distortion treatment is divided into two phases: apply and return. Apply represents the first segment where the distortion treat- ment begins, and return entails the latter segment where the virtually distorted room reverts to the original physical room layout. The timeline of the transformations used in each trial for all distortion effects can be seen in Fig. 6. The dependent variable is the participant’s reactions, which we measured through user locomotion. User locomotion is when a participant moves around the room while an assigned stimulus is being applied or returned. The Reality Distortion stimulus was measured as either a directional effect (user movement along an axis) or the Central Effect (change of the user’s distance to the room center) and depends on the design of the distortion treatment. The directional effect measures the user’s movement in relation to the axis along the room’s smaller dimension (i.e. left and right in Figure 11) while the apply and return stimuli are in effect and consists of Elongation, Warp, and Shift Distortions. The central effect (distance to center) measures the change in the user’s posi- tioning away from or towards the center of the room compared to before/after the stimulus segment and consists of Elevation and En- large Distortions. The average of the total user movement during each stimulus segment (10 seconds) was used for our evaluation. Baseline refers to the situation in
