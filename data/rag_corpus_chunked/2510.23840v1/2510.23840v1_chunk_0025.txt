dizziness, which made it challenging to comprehend the nature of these transformations from Rotation or Twist Distortion effects. Therefore, the third hypothesis was not confirmed. Figure 12: A raincloud plot depicting movement away and towards the center of the room when the elevation and expansion effects are applied. The upper whisker boundary of the box-plot is the largest data point that is within the 1.5 IQR above the third quartile. According to apply and return, respectively, the distance to the center was tracked. Figure 13: Magnitudes of the apply and return movements measured how far a user was from the center of the room. Based on the mean distance moved, the expansion effect resulted in slightly more movement away and towards the center, followed by the Elevation Distortion. 6 DISCUSSION As no clear objective was given, participants generally assumed that we wanted feedback on the space we designed, or that we were showcasing the new AR system. Many of them shared ideas on new 3D space ideas and what we should try next. This worked in our favor as we did not want to hint that we are examining their locomotion; our goal was to capture users’ natural locomotion from the distortion treatment. We found compelling differences between the stimulus segments apply, return, and the baseline segment in locomotion response. Among all three distortion treatments for manipulating directional effect, the Shift Distortion had the largest distance manipulated before and after the stimulus segments, while the Warp Distortion treatment showed the biggest positive axis movement when the room is being warped. This is likely due to users trying to get a better vantage point to see the end of the hallway and get a better idea of what is happening in their surroundings. The Elongation Distortion had the weakest effect, but
