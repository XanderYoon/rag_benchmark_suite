51]. Event-based meth- ods, such as dynamic saccadic redirection, have showcased a way to reduce the space required for immersive experiences [55]. Remixed Reality [28] explores the direct manipulation of the environment by offering users different and larger room layout options from their perspective. To further extend virtual space through augmentation and remote user presence, Room2Room [41] presented a prototype implementation for rearranging and extending the virtual layout in consideration of physical space through augmentation. Additionally, Reality Check [13] demonstrated how a virtual game environment can be combined with real-time 3D reconstruction of the room, resulting in a presence platform experience. 2.2 Room-scale Interaction The physical constraints of a room can make it difficult to fully experience the six degrees of freedom in virtual reality. However, extensive research led to the exploration of redirected walking [35, 44, 53], a method that subtly adjusts the user’s direction without them noticing, allowing the user to be immersed in a large virtual environment within limited physical layout they are operating in to provide a seamless experience [25, 60, 62]. Recent works [3, 18, 19] adopted a spatial augmented reality (SAR) system, embracing limited room space and scale and deliver- ing a customized layout. This platform suggests strategies that use a room for an access point, port, and physical interactive space while expanding the interactivity well beyond the room scale. In recent years, we have seen many room-scale VR games that use the layout of the room both as part of the virtual environment layout and use the full floor space as an interactive space [7, 17, 59]. For example, the VR game Custom Home Mapper: Castle Defender (2020) uses the player’s room layout to generate the top floor of the tower balcony. Eye of the Temple (2020) constructs a temple maze from surroundings
