enlarge stimulus segment. Lastly, most participants found particles in the space to be a nice addition, stating it “magical”and “fun to interact with” (P5). 6.1 Limitations Reality Distortion Room demonstrates a visual perception locomo- tion aid designed for the purpose of safety, entertainment, and inter- action. While the study provides insight into how visual perception can be used to manipulate a user’s natural locomotion, its findings are based on a small participant sample and brief trials, underscoring the need for deeper exploration of design considerations. We tested five distortion treatment designs in this study under- standing that many more distortion treatment designs could be ex- plored. Our user study suggests interesting directions for future work and we foresee many ways to expand this concept. The challenge in using distortion treatment is that the transformation is very no- ticeable and, at times, intrusive. Creative solutions must be explored in using distortion treatment to deliver a cohesive user experience. We suggest distortion treatment to be adopted in catered space and situations, where the design of the geometric distortion is modified to the designated physical space. This curated experience, where aspects of the real-world deviate from reality, requires further study. Our study utilized a full-surround augmented reality platform with projections covering the entire human field of view and beyond, achieving this setup at home is unlikely. Additionally, while the system was the best fit for our use, whenever the user came within 60 cm of the wall, the user’s shadow became visible, blocking the projection of the wall. Also, the outline projected to furniture disappeared when the user blocked the projection. Though we had overwhelmingly positive responses from the par- ticipants, we believe the novelty factor may have played a role in how actively the participants explored the room, inducing more walking in
