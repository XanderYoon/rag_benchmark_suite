of the room both as part of the virtual environment layout and use the full floor space as an interactive space [7, 17, 59]. For example, the VR game Custom Home Mapper: Castle Defender (2020) uses the player’s room layout to generate the top floor of the tower balcony. Eye of the Temple (2020) constructs a temple maze from surroundings for the player, and Tea for God (2021) converts the player’s room to a bunker with windows on each wall. Room-scale interactability is appealing as it can be catered to current VR users, which is why research targeting room-scale mixed reality persists [10, 25, 52]. Our system also caters to the standard room- scale layout as seen in Fig. 2. 2.3 3D Reconstruction for Physical Spaces The wide accessibility of depth cameras has produced much re- markable research around 3D reconstruction using these technolo- gies [34, 39] such as adding IMU sensors [11] to examine outdoor 3D navigation [42]. Robust 3D reconstruction in a combination of object detection research [1, 24, 27, 31] provides insight into always- on display AR experiences [14,33]. HoloLens and Magic Leap, both augmented reality (AR) devices, utilize spatial mapping [29, 63], scan and examine the physical layout of the user’s surroundings to find the optimal location to place virtual contents [20, 23]. Projects like FLARE, SnapToReality, VRoamer and Dynamic Theater ex- hibit the potential these intelligent virtual content projections have to enrich immersive mixed reality experiences [5, 10, 21, 36]. While current spatial mapping for VR-AR systems does well with scanning surroundings for planar surfaces, finding usable space to project vir- tual objects, and designing a virtual environment, they are ultimately restricted to the physical layout. The benefits and impacts of a wide field of view beyond our vision are clear [45]. Our projection mapping
