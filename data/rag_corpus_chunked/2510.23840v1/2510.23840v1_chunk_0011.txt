viewpoint as found in RoomAlive system [18]. The distorting 3D geometry model is placed and oriented in the physical room and the scene is constructed based on the viewpoint of the user. As the projection is rendered in a view-dependent manner, the participant is free to walk around the room without a headset. As the user in the room is not tethered to anything they are encouraged to walk around and conduct true normal locomotion. Since Reality Distortion Room features full surround visual coverage of the virtual environment, projected onto the physical environment, what the user will see is the room they are standing in, transformed into a different shape. While the distortion treatment is underway, the user’s stereopsis will not align with the intended visual of a deformed room. We made sure that all our distortion treatments return back to the default phys- ical room layout with the standard projection mapping applied. We believe coming back to a condition where the virtual environment aligns with the physical arrangement is crucial for the user’s affor- dance as this process blends real and virtual. For the virtual room to be precisely aligned with the physical counterpart, the system goes through a calibration process. Static 3D geometry that includes both stationary and moving objects is reconstructed with data collected from scanning a cloud of 3D points. With these baseline dimensions, projected content may be precisely aligned with the physical layout. Details on this calibration process can be found in the RoomAlive paper [18]. 3.2 Distortion Treatment Components Distortion treatment alters the geometric perception of the physical layout. We implement various transformations of the environment. We evaluated various distortion treatments to determine their ef- fectiveness in generating consistent locomotion transitions. We examined 10 treatment designs: elongation, warp, shift, elevation, enlarge, enlarge (even larger),
