Overhead view of the physical space of the room compared to its virtual extension during the Elongation Distortion. 2, are equipped with relatively small field-of-view displays, which limits immersion. Video pass-through MR, such as the Varjo XR-3 or Meta Quest Pro, is becoming more commonplace but still has fidelity problems. Thus, we opted to run this study in spatial aug- mented reality, using spatial projection as seen in Fig.1a. We utilized RealityShader’s projected augmented reality system [18] to capture and react to the user’s locomotion response. The RealityShader sys- tem allows us to assess visual distortion effects while enabling users to walk in a fully surrounded projected space and untethered to a physical device as seen in Fig. 3b. We performed several additional treatments, including augmenting the space with randomly floating particles and overlaying furniture outlines as seen in Fig. 1. Our system encourages users to move in certain ways within the room. In applying the distortion treatments in an immersive AR ex- perience, our study found that the Reality Distortion Room impacts users’ movement and reactions in specific ways, without explicitly telling them to do so. This study provides the first empirical evidence that developers can influence the motion of users by warping and modulating the AR space, which suggests a potential mechanism to be used in the eventual realization of redirected walking in an AR environment. We see great application in our system for helping users make modest positioning adjustments, especially when stan- dard tools for adjustments, such as sound systems, are being used. We make the following contributions: • Design and pilot testing of different distortion geometries for our system, the Reality Distortion Room. • A user study (n=20) demonstrating the effectiveness of system- atically influencing a user’s natural locomotion. • Analysis of study results, demonstrating user
