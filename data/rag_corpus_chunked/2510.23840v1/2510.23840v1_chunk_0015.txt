each treatment was tested with two different segment speeds (7 seconds and 10 seconds), for a total of twenty treatments in which ten induced the directional effect while the other ten induced the central effect. We also assessed the impact of deploying particles to encourage increased walking. We found that distortion effects characterized by excessively rapid transformations, intricate geometric alterations, and rotation effects did not conform to discernible patterns. For example, some participants noted difficulty comprehending the trans- formations based on the speed or geometry of their implementation, citing dizziness and confusion. Based on this feedback, We omitted certain distortion treatments, altered the geometry and speed of the remaining transformations, and here are the five distortion designs included in the main study: • Distortion treatment 1 (Elongation) refers to a geometric layout transformation of a room where one wall recedes into the distance and then returns (elongates and shortens). This is called Elongation Distortion and the treatment is designed to have a directional effect. The Elongation Distortion (Fig. 3) elongates one side of the wall outward horizontally for 3.35 meters during the “Apply” segments of the stimulus, while in the “Return” segments the elongated wall shortens back to align with the physical room. • Distortion treatment 2 (Warp) refers to a geometric layout transformation of a room where the entire room warps and unwarps. This is called the Warp Distortion and the treatment is designed to have a directional effect. The Warp Distortion consisted of the continuous warping (bending) of extended versions of two opposite parallel walls of the room. The dis- tortion treatment consists of one warp and unwarp action for each stimulus segment. The bend angle of the parallel walls consists of 160° with the bend executed along a 19.33m length of the wall. • Distortion treatment 3
