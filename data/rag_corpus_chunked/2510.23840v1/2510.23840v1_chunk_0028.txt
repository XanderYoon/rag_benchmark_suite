cm of the wall, the user’s shadow became visible, blocking the projection of the wall. Also, the outline projected to furniture disappeared when the user blocked the projection. Though we had overwhelmingly positive responses from the par- ticipants, we believe the novelty factor may have played a role in how actively the participants explored the room, inducing more walking in the room. In addition, people moved without any in- struction or clear objective in our study, as we wanted to examine if we could manipulate users without using instruction by only using distortion treatment. This raises questions about the performance of distortion treatments when a user is presented with tasks in the space and the effectiveness of the distortion effect when using parts of the projected environment rather than the grid system. We hope to tackle this question in our future work. 7 CONCLUSION Through this project, we examined the Reality Distortion Room, a proof of concept that shows how visual perception of certain room distortion effects can invoke cohesive natural locomotion responses from the user. We tested a variety of spatial orientation visual ef- fects. The user study demonstrated that the distortion treatments we designed were effective in influencing users’ natural locomotion in predictable ways. By relying on users’ reactions to their visual perception of space, we can open new ways to engage with famil- iar environments, or to navigate in an enhanced, altered, or even completely virtual reality. We are especially excited that this study presents possibilities of instilling movement in people solely through visual deformations of the AR spaces they populate.
