this calibration process can be found in the RoomAlive paper [18]. 3.2 Distortion Treatment Components Distortion treatment alters the geometric perception of the physical layout. We implement various transformations of the environment. We evaluated various distortion treatments to determine their ef- fectiveness in generating consistent locomotion transitions. We examined 10 treatment designs: elongation, warp, shift, elevation, enlarge, enlarge (even larger), rotation, twist, furniture rotation, and furniture shift. Highlighted grid panels, where each tile is 65cm x 65cm, overlay the entire room assisting the user in understanding the transforming geometry while showing the scale transformation. We also added particles in the space to demonstrate accurate reflections of motion parallax as users moved as well as to assist with seeing added or subtracted space. This easily allows better spatial aware- ness, while inducing more movement without presenting one target. Each particle is 1.92cm in radius and floats at a speed of 1 cm per second in a random direction (Fig. 1c). Approximately 712 particles float around in every 10-meter cubed space. Every trial we tested featured particles in space except for one trial, which was baseline without distortion. While designing three distortion treatments that stimulate the oc- cupant’s movement along an axis identified in Fig. 2), we imagined how we would move and respond to a transforming space around us. We identified where people would be most likely to walk to- ward to secure their safety or view when the room began distorting. The same concept was applied to the two distortion treatments that influenced the user’s distance to the center of the room. When de- signing the floor layout of the distortion treatment we made sure the virtual space did not transform any smaller than the physical walkable space, presenting the full room layout for users to walk around without being
