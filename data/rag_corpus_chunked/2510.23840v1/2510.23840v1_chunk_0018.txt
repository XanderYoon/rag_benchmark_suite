H1: The augmented distortion treatment can induce partici- pants to move more in some directions than others. • H2: The augmented distortion treatment can induce partici- pants to move closer to or away from the center of the room. • H3: The augmented distortion treatment can induce partici- pants to turn or move in a circular direction. 4.1 Procedure Participants were introduced to all five distortion treatments in each trial in addition to two trials for the baseline: static room with particles and without particles in the space. Each trial lasted a full 60 seconds, consisting of two cycles of stimulus segments: two “Apply” segments and two “Return” segments. When participants arrived, a researcher guided them into the room equipped with the projection system. Upon entry, the room projectors remained off though ambient lighting allowed the user to see objects in the room. The ambient lights remained on through the entire trial but were outshone by the lights from the projectors. Participants were given a brief introduction to our system and verbal instructions for the study: they are free to move around and interact naturally within the room during the trial but asked to refrain from sitting down on any surfaces. We encouraged walking and examining the room during the trial and let them know that we would be asking a few questions following the trial. We also informed participants that they were free to leave the room at any time if they felt discomfort (i.e. sickness, fright). A researcher remained outside of the room to monitor participants through the 3D reconstructed live inspector. After each 60-second trial, we turned off the projection and asked the participants to sit in the center seat of the couch. In between trials, we asked a few questions about their experience to ensure the
