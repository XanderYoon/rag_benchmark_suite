mapping [13, 56]. These techniques can operate in a smaller space; however, the experience is regularly interrupted to correct the user’s position when the user approaches the limit of the available walking space. VR routinely utilizes techniques such as room marking systems to assist users in navigating safely within the room when using VR. Room setup features introduced in SteamVR and Meta Quest SDK allow users to mark out surfaces of the physical layout of the home to better avoid collisions when the user is immersed in virtual reality [37, 58]. These methods, such as collision bounds and Chaperone, cannot be directly applied to AR applications as the physical layout is present at all times in the platform experience. While redirected walking in Mixed Reality using VR headset and passive haptics [22, 54] has been examined, our research marks a step towards redirected walking in visual AR. Motion parallax and perspective-correct rendering of computer graphics content allow augmented experiences that are different from the physical layout the viewer is in [4, 12]. In this work, we additionally explore the possibility of subtly manipulating a user’s natural locomotion via visual motion effects. Reality Distortion Room (RDR) presents five room distortion treatments in augmented reality that employ the user’s visual percep- tion and spatial understanding to subtly manipulate their position via natural locomotion. Using wireframe overlay effects, we mapped walls and furniture to generate an omnidirectional room-scale dis- play that renders a 3D reconstruction and extension of the user’s physical space. Out of the five distortion treatments, three treatments are designed to impact the user’s directional motion pattern (move- ment along an axis, refer to Fig. 2a for axis directions), whereas the other two treatments are designed to impact the user’s motion to and from the room center (distance-to-center). Our study examines
