positioning adjustments, especially when stan- dard tools for adjustments, such as sound systems, are being used. We make the following contributions: • Design and pilot testing of different distortion geometries for our system, the Reality Distortion Room. • A user study (n=20) demonstrating the effectiveness of system- atically influencing a user’s natural locomotion. • Analysis of study results, demonstrating user locomotion re- sponses to generic room shape changes in a projected aug- mented environment. In particular, a directional effect and a center distancing effect are demonstrated as a reaction to the ge- ometric deformation of the environment (distortion treatment) alone. 2 RELATEDWORK Our platform offers a virtual world that alters and extends existing physical space. Making use of physical layout to enhance the expe- rience in a virtual world was previously explored. Fuchs envisioned the potential ways to utilize the combination of virtual and real worlds, implementing the CA VE system in the Office of the Future project [43]. The spectrum of the AR-VR continuum was previously explored from the human computer interaction aspect [2,3,32,48,50] Each method utilizes space in different ways when users are explor- ing virtual environments. For example, one such method detaches the user entirely from the physical space, making the movement fric- tionless and stationary using a treadmill [8,15,16,30]. Other methods include adjusting sensitivity of input and output of the tracked move- ment between virtual and real to redirect the user [26, 56] or provid- ing a dynamic haptic environment where the physical layout adopts to a virtual one [6, 15, 57]. In addition, previous work investigating “vection”, or “illusions of self-motion” study how to convincingly simulate human locomotion in virtual environments without having to allow for full physical movement of the user [46,47]. RDR, on the other hand, looks at the problem from the perspective
