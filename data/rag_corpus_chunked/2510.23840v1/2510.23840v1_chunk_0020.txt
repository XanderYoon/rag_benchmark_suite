In this section, we report two types of Distortion Effects, with three distortion treatments designed for directional effect, and two distortion treatments designed for central effect. 5.1 Particle Effect and Natural Locomotion Our goal was to induce more natural walking without influencing the participant’s movement in a specific direction, as there were no user tasks assigned. Here we compared the total walking distance in the room with particles, without particles, and without the distortion treatment. Without particles, the mean total walking distance was 16.70 m with a standard deviation of 6.38 m. Furniture outlines and wall grids were present in baseline trials with and without particles. Users walked an average distance of 28.80 meters, with a standard deviation of 6.75m, in studies with particles, revealing that the existence of particles significantly increased walking distance. (p< 0.001). As a result of an ANOV A analysis by classifying walking distance into a “No particle” group and a “With particles” group, there was a significant difference in the mean between the two groups (Fig. 8c). In the ANOV A table, the F value was 34.538, and the Figure 8: Total walking distance (TWD) in effects with and without particles, revealing that the existence of particles increases walking distance ( p< 0.001). The raincloud plot shows user distribution of TWD result and box indicating the median and interquartile range (IQR). p-value was less than 0.001 demonstrating a statistically significant difference between the “No particle” group and the “With particles” group. 5.2 Directional Effect: Axis Movement The following reports the directional effects of
