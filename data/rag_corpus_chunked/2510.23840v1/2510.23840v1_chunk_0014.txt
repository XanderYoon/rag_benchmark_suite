central effect (distance to center) measures the change in the user’s posi- tioning away from or towards the center of the room compared to before/after the stimulus segment and consists of Elevation and En- large Distortions. The average of the total user movement during each stimulus segment (10 seconds) was used for our evaluation. Baseline refers to the situation in which no distortion treatment is augmented. We established a baseline by running trials with parti- cles but no visual effects or treatments. We separated the baseline data into 10-second segments for the analysis. We randomly selected 15 segments from each user’s trial to include all potential data seg- ments from the trial. Along with the five distortion treatments, we conducted two additional trials: 1) no distortion treatment with no particles and 2) no distortion treatment with particles. As all trials with distortion treatment included particles, base data points were collected in trials with particles although no distortion treatment was applied. 3.3 Pilot Study The experimental portion of this study was designed to measure the effect of distortion treatment on user locomotion responses. First, experiment design (distortion treatment) is a set of geometric distor- tions that affect the user’s movement patterns within the room along the axes, central point, and rotation. All the distortion effects occur with respect to the physical room, regardless of the orientation of the user. We examined all ten distortion designs in our pilot study. In addition, each treatment was tested with two different segment speeds (7 seconds and 10 seconds), for a total of twenty treatments in which ten induced the directional effect while the other ten induced the central effect. We also assessed the impact of deploying particles to encourage increased walking. We found that distortion effects characterized by excessively rapid transformations, intricate geometric alterations,
