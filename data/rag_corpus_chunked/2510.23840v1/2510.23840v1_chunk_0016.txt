The Warp Distortion consisted of the continuous warping (bending) of extended versions of two opposite parallel walls of the room. The dis- tortion treatment consists of one warp and unwarp action for each stimulus segment. The bend angle of the parallel walls consists of 160° with the bend executed along a 19.33m length of the wall. • Distortion treatment 3 (Shift) refers to a geometric layout transformation of a room where parallel walls shift and unshift (shift back) horizontally. This is called the Shift Distortion and the treatment is designed to have a directional effect. The Shift Distortion utilizes two parallel walls of the room, shifting 5.14 meters side to side in the horizontal direction. During the “Apply” segments the wall shifts in a set horizontal direction, Figure 5: Distortion treatments 1, 2 and 3 stimulate axis movement, while distortion treatments 4 and 5 stimulate distance to the center. while in the “Return” segments (unshift) the wall shifts back in the opposite horizontal direction. • Distortion treatment 4 (Elevate) refers to a geometric layout transformation of a room that ascends from and descends to the ground level. The user experiences this as either being elevated above or sinking below the ground. This is called the Elevation Distortion and the treatment is designed to have a central effect (changing the user’s distance to the room center). The Elevation Distortion consists of the virtual room going up and down 8.07 meters vertically. During the stimulus segments, the room elevates from and descends to the base ground level. • Distortion treatment 5 (Enlarge) refers to a geometric layout transformation of a room that enlarges and compresses. Users experience this as the walls moving away from or coming closer to them. This is called the Expansion Distortion and, like for Elevate, the treatment is
