RM: Retrieval Methods (TR: Traditional Retrieval, RFR: Rank Fusion with weighted strategy (1, 0.25) respectively for dense embedder models and BM25 em- beddings – additional Reranking step for RFR). 5.4 Dynamic segmenting models As shown in Table 3, the performance of pipelines utilizing dynamic segmen- tation, such as with Jina-V3, is superior to other approaches. However, this improvement comes at the cost of increased computational requirements and longer processing times. Specifically, embedding theNFCorpus dataset entirely with our experimental setup with fixed-size or semantic segmenter takes approx- imately 30 minutes. In comparison, theSimple-Qwen model requires twice the time, while theTopic-Qwen model requires four times as long. Another drawback of these models is their generative nature, which can lead to inconsistencies. They do not always produce the exact same wording for chunks, rendering them less reliable in certain scenarios. 6 Conclusion While both approaches are effective solutions at mitigating the challenge of context-dilemma, maintaining context in document retrieval in certain scenar- 12 J.
