shows improved results especially when chunks are enriched with additional context from the document. In this way,BM25 matches search terms in both segments and contexts, leading to very good results. It is important to note that adding the final reranking step in the workflow is crucial to leverage this potential and see consistent improvements in the results. 5.2 Traditional Retrieval Versus Latechunking Retrieval Upon analyzing the results in Table 3, we observe that the novel Late Chunk- ing approach performs well in most cases when compared to the Early version. This indicates its potential as an effective retrieval strategy for many scenar- ios. However, it is important to note that Late Chunking does not consistently outperform the Early approach across all models and datasets. For instance, with the BGE-M3 model applied to the NFCorpus, the Early version demonstrates superior performance, highlighting a case where the Late Chunking approach falls short. This observation is further confirmed through testing on the MsMarco dataset using the Stella-V5 model (Table 4), where once again the Early version outperforms the Late Chunking approach. These findings suggest that while Late Chunking introduces promising im- provements in certain contexts, its efficacy may vary depending on the dataset and model used, emphasizing the need for careful selection of retrieval strategies based on specific use cases. 5.3 Latechunking Versus ContextualRankFusion Retrieval In Table 5 we compare the best results obtained for ContextualRankFusion with Latechunking on the same subset of NFCorpus in order to compare the two techniques. The embedding model used isJina-V3, for Fixed-Window Chunks. ContextualRankFusion obtains better results overall.
