but often at the cost of complex, heavyweight client-side preprocessing. A more lightweight alternative is the cluster-based paradigm, used by systems like Tiptoe [3], which partitions the database and uses fast homomorphic encryption to return only a ranked list of identifiers. While efficient, this approach is fundamentally misaligned with the end goal of RAG, which requires the full content of the retrieved documents, not just their IDs. Retrieving this content would necessitate a series of subsequent, expensive PIR queries, nullifying the initial performance gains. In this work, we argue that a truly practical solution for private RAG requires a new architecture designed from the ground up for its specific workflow. We introduce PIR-RAG, a novel system that addresses this need. Our core insight is that the architectural choice of retrieving an entire pre- defined document cluster in a single, batched PIR operation is uniquely suited for RAG. While seemingly coarse-grained, this ”cluster-and-fetch” design elegantly amortizes the cost of content fetching, which is an unavoidable and expensive final step in any other private retrieval architecture. By merging the retrieval and fetching phases, PIR-RAG transforms what would be K+1 slow operations into a single, highly efficient one. We summarize our contributions as follows: • We propose a new architecture for private RAG that combines coarse-grained semantic clus- tering with a fast, lattice-based PIR protocol, specifically optimizing for the end-to-end con- tent retrieval task. • We present an efficient system implementation featuring a novel chunk-transposed data struc- ture, which transforms the private retrieval into a single, high-performance homomorphic matrix-vector product. • We conduct a comprehensive comparative evaluation of PIR-RAG against our own imple- mentations of strong graph-based and Tiptoe-style baselines, providing a clear, data-driven analysis of the architectural trade-offs in terms of scalability, performance, and search quality. Our results establish PIR-RAG as a
