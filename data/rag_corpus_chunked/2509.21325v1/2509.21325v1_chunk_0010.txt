is tied to the increasing cluster size. The communication costs are shown in Figures 2(c) and 2(d). The downlink communication reveals the core architectural trade-offs: PIR-RAG incurs the highest cost by far (growing to nearly 475 MB), as it fetches the full plaintext content of an entire cluster. Graph-PIR and the Tiptoe- style system are far more conservative, transmitting only kilobytes of data. This stark difference is central to our analysis of the systems’ fitness for the end-to-end RAG task. Communication costs are shown in Figures 2(c) and 2(d). PIR-RAG has the most efficient uplink communication (2.4 KB to 24 KB), as it only needs to transmit a single encrypted one-hot vector. The downlink communication reveals the core architectural trade-offs: PIR-RAG incurs the highest cost by far (growing from 47.6 MB to 474 MB), as it fetches the full plaintext content of an entire cluster. Graph-PIR and the Tiptoe-style system are far more conservative in their download, transmitting only a few hundred kilobytes, as they only return identifiers or scores. This stark difference in download cost is central to our analysis of the systems’ fitness for the end-to-end RAG task. 4.3 Search Quality and Performance Comparison In Figure 3, we present a detailed comparison of search quality and query time on a fixed-size task of 5,000 documents from the MS MARCO dataset. The search quality results, shown in Figures 3(a) and 3(b), reveal a clear hierarchy. Graph-PIR achieves the highest search quality (0.901 NDCG@10 and 0.850 Precision@10), demonstrating the effectiveness of its fine-grained graph traversal. PIR-RAG provides strong, competitive quality (0.799 NDCG@10 and 0.710 Precision@10), significantly outperforming the Tiptoe-style architec- ture, which trails with the lowest quality (0.513 NDCG@10). Figure 3(c) compares the end-to-end query time for the retrieval phase. Here, Graph-PIR is the fastest at 12.99s, followed by PIR-RAG
