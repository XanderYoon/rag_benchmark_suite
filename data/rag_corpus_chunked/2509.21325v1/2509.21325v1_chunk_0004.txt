Retrieval-Augmented Generation and its Privacy Gap Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [5] has emerged as a dominant paradigm for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with timely and factual knowledge from external sources. The standard RAG workflow involves embedding a user’s query, searching a vector database for relevant document chunks, and providing these chunks as context to an LLM. While highly effective at improving factual grounding and reducing hallucinations, this process introduces a critical privacy vulnerability: the retrieval server is exposed to the user’s queries (or their embeddings), which can reveal sensitive personal, commercial, or proprietary information. Our work directly addresses this privacy gap by designing a system where the retrieval step is cryptographically protected. 2.2 Advances in Private Information Retrieval Private Information Retrieval (PIR) is a cryptographic protocol, first introduced by Chor et al. [2], that allows a client to retrieve an item from a server’s database without the server learning which item was retrieved. Historically, PIR schemes were considered too computationally expensive for practical use. However, recent breakthroughs have drastically improved their performance, making them viable for real-world systems. Modern PIR schemes are often built on homomorphic encryption. The field has increasingly shifted towards schemes built on lattice-based cryptography, specifically the Learning With Errors (LWE) problem [8]. These LWE-based linearly homomorphic encryption (LHE) schemes, such as those used in SimplePIR [4] and YPIR [7], offer computational speeds that are orders of magnitude faster than predecessors. The core computation, often a matrix-vector product, becomes almost as fast as its plaintext equivalent, shifting the primary performance bottleneck from computation to communication. Our PIR-RAG system leverages a fast, LWE-based PIR protocol to ensure high server-side performance. 2.3 Architectures for Private Search Applying a PIR primitive naively to a large database remains inefficient. The key research chal- lenge, therefore, lies in designing system architectures that
