knowledge management systems to personal AI assistants, RAG has become the de facto standard for building powerful, knowledgeable AI applications. However, this powerful architecture introduces a critical and often overlooked privacy dilemma. The retrieval step, which is the cornerstone of RAG, requires users to send their queries—or high- fidelity vector embeddings of them—to a centralized server that hosts the document corpus. These queries can be deeply personal, commercially sensitive, or legally privileged, ranging from health inquiries and financial planning questions to proprietary research and development topics. Exposing this information to the service provider creates a significant privacy risk, undermining user trust and creating barriers to adoption in sensitive domains. The natural cryptographic solution to this problem is Private Information Retrieval (PIR), a protocol that allows a client to fetch a data item from a server without revealing which item was 1 arXiv:2509.21325v1 [cs.IR] 1 Sep 2025 chosen. Despite recent and significant performance improvements driven by lattice-based cryptog- raphy [4], a naive application of PIR to RAG systems remains computationally infeasible. A single PIR query over a database of millions of documents is still too slow and resource-intensive for an interactive user experience. This performance bottleneck has spurred the development of specialized private search archi- tectures designed to make PIR practical. These systems typically first prune the vast search space before invoking a cryptographic protocol. Graph-based architectures, such as PACMANN [10], construct intricate similarity graphs to enable highly accurate, targeted retrievals, but often at the cost of complex, heavyweight client-side preprocessing. A more lightweight alternative is the cluster-based paradigm, used by systems like Tiptoe [3], which partitions the database and uses fast homomorphic encryption to return only a ranked list of identifiers. While efficient, this approach is fundamentally misaligned with the end goal of RAG, which requires the full content of
