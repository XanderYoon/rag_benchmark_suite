a single operation, thereby merging the ”retrieval” and ”fetching” steps. Graph-based Architectures. This paradigm, exemplified by systems like PACMANN [10] and Compass [11], prioritizes search accuracy by building a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) similarity graph, often using the HNSW algorithm [6]. Retrieval is performed via a private, multi-step traversal of this graph. These systems can achieve higher search quality because their search is not confined to a single cluster. However, they come with their own distinct trade-offs. PACMANN, for instance, achieves extremely low online query latency but does so by offloading a massive preprocessing burden to the client, which must stream the entire index. Compass uses Oblivious RAM (ORAM) [9] to achieve even stronger privacy by hiding access patterns, but this comes at a significant performance cost. PIR-RAG carves out a unique position in this design space. It avoids the heavy client-side burden of systems like PACMANN and, unlike scoring-based systems like Tiptoe, is architecturally tailored for the end-to-end RAG task. By efficiently delivering full document content in a single private operation, it offers a practical and balanced solution specifically for privacy-preserving RAG. 3 System Design: PIR-RAG We designed PIR-RAG to enable private document retrieval in two primary phases: an offline setup phase and an online query phase. The overall architecture is shown in Figure 1. 3.1 Threat Model We operate under the honest-but-curious server model. The server will correctly follow the pro- tocol but may attempt to analyze all data it observes (i.e., the user’s encrypted queries) to infer information about the user’s interests. The goal of PIR-RAG is to ensure the server learns nothing about the specific document cluster the user is interested in. 3.2 Offline Phase: Corpus Preprocessing Before any queries can be served, the server preprocesses the document corpus in a one-time setup consisting of two stages.
