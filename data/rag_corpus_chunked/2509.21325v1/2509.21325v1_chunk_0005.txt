product, becomes almost as fast as its plaintext equivalent, shifting the primary performance bottleneck from computation to communication. Our PIR-RAG system leverages a fast, LWE-based PIR protocol to ensure high server-side performance. 2.3 Architectures for Private Search Applying a PIR primitive naively to a large database remains inefficient. The key research chal- lenge, therefore, lies in designing system architectures that intelligently structure data to make PIR practical. Prior work on private document retrieval, such as Coeus [1], focused on oblivious ranking using TF-IDF, but modern systems increasingly rely on semantic search over vector embeddings. We categorize recent semantic search architectures into two relevant paradigms. Cluster-based Architectures. This approach, which both PIR-RAG and Tiptoe [3] belong to, involves partitioning the database into semantic clusters. The client first identifies a target cluster locally using public metadata (e.g., centroids) and then uses a PIR protocol to interact only with that cluster’s data. This dramatically prunes the search space. However, the architectural goals of Tiptoe and PIR-RAG diverge significantly. Tiptoe is designed for private web search, where 3 the goal is to return a ranked list of identifiers or scores. It uses its LHE scheme to privately compute similarity scores on the server, returning only encrypted scores. This makes it incomplete for RAG, which requires the full document content. PIR-RAG, in contrast, is architecturally designed for the RAG workflow. It uses the PIR protocol to retrieve the entire content of the target cluster in a single operation, thereby merging the ”retrieval” and ”fetching” steps. Graph-based Architectures. This paradigm, exemplified by systems like PACMANN [10] and Compass [11], prioritizes search accuracy by building a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) similarity graph, often using the HNSW algorithm [6]. Retrieval is performed via a private, multi-step traversal of this graph. These systems can achieve higher search quality because their
