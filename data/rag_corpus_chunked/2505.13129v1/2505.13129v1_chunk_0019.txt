findings indicate that while retrieval can enhance generation accuracy, its effectiveness is highly dependent on the retrieval method and the number of retrieved chunks 𝑘. BM25-based retrieval underperformed the baseline, likely due to its reliance on exact term matching, which may not always align with natural language specifications. In contrast, semantic retrieval approaches such as BERT and SPLADE provided better performance, with SPLADE achieving the best results at lower 𝑘 values but degrading at higher 𝑘 values due to the inclusion of less relevant context. A key takeaway is that blindly increasing 𝑘 does not always yield better results. Instead, an optimal retriever-dependent balance must be struck to avoid retrieval-induced noise while ensuring sufficient context for the generation model. Additionally, we observed that retrieval approaches with lower variance in performance provide more reliable and overall better results, which may be preferable in practical applications where consistency is crucial. Additionally, our comparison with the PathOCL method highlights that our RAG-based approach, particularly SPLADE with 𝑘 = 10, outperforms graph-based path selection, especially on larger and more complex meta-models.
