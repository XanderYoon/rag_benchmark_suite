When looking at the performance with 10% of the worst samples removed, we observe that the model with 𝑘 = 50 is no longer the best-performing one. This indicates that when disregarding consistency as defined by the ability to limit outliers, a slightly lower value for 𝑘 might provide better performance. The SPLADE-based retriever produced mixed results, as shown in Table 3, showing relatively high cosine similarity at lower values of 𝑘 = 10 but experiencing a strong decline in performance as 𝑘 increased. Notably, SPLADE at 𝑘 = 10 outperformed all other retrieval approaches, including the baseline and the best-performing BERT-based retriever (Fig. 3), suggesting that sparse-vector retrieval models may be particularly beneficial when selecting a limited number of relevant chunks. We hypothesize
