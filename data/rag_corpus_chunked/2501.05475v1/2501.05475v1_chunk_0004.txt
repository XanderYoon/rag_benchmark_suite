major components: (1)Evidence Collation retrieves rel- evant documents from the retrieval corpus as thesource evi- dence, which would be utilized as doubtless material to gen- erate inferential evidence , besides serving as the primary reference for the answering. The source evidence will be continuously updated as the question-solving process pro- gresses, to mitigate the influence of retrieved irrelevant in- formation; (2)Evidence Discovery first generates as much inferential evidence related to the key entities in question as possible from the source evidence. Then, inferential ev- idence will be filtered from the perspectives of relevance to the question and its attribution to the source evidence, to ensure the effectiveness. Inferential evidence would also be updated to only remain the most relevant parts. While both evidence would be used to help generate answers, the gap between the stored evidence and the initial question would be simultaneously analyzed, and the search-query would be proposed for retrieving more information in need. Along with the Answerer to generate and evaluate the answer, RetroRAG provides an approach for refining effec- tive reasoning chains through credible evidence. The exper- imental results on two multi-hop question answering (QA) datasets verify the effectiveness and state-of-the-art perfor- mance of RetroRAG, while also demonstrating the explain- ability in the reasoning process. The contributions of this paper are summarized as: • We introduce RetroRAG approach, an innovative retrieval-augmented generation framework. Unlike exist- ing RAG approaches uses an unidirectional forwards rea- soning paradigm that cannot reverse the error in preced- ing reasoning steps, RetroRAG uses a retroactive reason- ing paradigm that can revise and reconstruct the reason- ing chain through two types of evidence, provides effec- tive answers with less hallucination. • To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time an evidence-collation-and-discovery framework has been proposed and used in a retrieval-augmented
