of the detective, that iteratively collates evidence to gather all related factual information, and through evidence discov- ery process to validate the relevance of evidence then update them, while uncovering unresolved issues along the way, to ultimately reach a valid conclusion. By continuously revis- ing and reconstructing the reasoning chain through the evi- dence collation and discovery process, a comprehensive and definitive conclusion can be obtained(Findley 2011; Fahsing 2022). This evidence-collation-and-discovery structure al- lows LLMs to rethink and revise the reasoning chain through a Retroactive paradigm, correcting previous errors result- ing from insufficient information by utilizing newly discov- ered evidence. As illustrated in Figure 1, LLMs can collate the evidence that Eric Harrison was the youth coach of the manager Alex Fergusonsince 1986, and Ferguson was actu- ally the manager, then update the reasoning process and an- swer correctly. Inspired by this detective-like approach, we introduce the Retroactive Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework (RetroRAG). To effectively generate and utilize evidence, there are two aspects need to be considered: (1)The Effectiveness: the evi- dence should align with external inherent knowledge(Flores and Woodard 2023), while being attributable(Gao et al. 2023) and relevant(Liu et al. 2024), to avoid the irrelevant noise; (2)Dynamic Updating: the evidence should be con- tinuously updated based on newly discovered information and overarching question, rather than being confined to lo- cal sub-questions. Hence, RetroRAG constructs Evidence- coLLation-and-discovERY framework ( ELLERY) to re- trieve, generate, and update the evidence, which involves two major components: (1)Evidence Collation retrieves rel- evant documents from the retrieval corpus as thesource evi- dence, which would be utilized as doubtless material to gen- erate inferential evidence , besides serving as the primary reference for the answering. The source evidence will be continuously updated as the question-solving process pro- gresses, to mitigate the influence of retrieved irrelevant in- formation;
