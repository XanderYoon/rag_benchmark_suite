approaches have been pro- posed to improve the effectiveness of knowledge documents retrieval(Asai et al. 2024; Xu et al. 2024), current RAG frameworks are susceptible to the threat of insufficient rea- soning from the documents which are factual, and related, but irrelevant due to the inherent flaws of current retrieval systems(Wu et al. 2024), and cause external hallucination. As illustrated in Figure 1, the excessive focus on the local sub-question of who recruited Beckham? obtaining the in- correct answer of Eric Harrison, the youth coach of Manch- ester United who recruited Beckham in the youth team but never as the manager, rather than the manager at time Alex Ferguson, and mislead the following reasoning steps. We argue that this flaw originates from the Unidirec- tional Forwards reasoning paradigm inherent in traditional RAG methods. In this paradigm, any errors produced dur- ing reasoning steps are irreversible for the whole reason- ing chain. Although the paradigm can be altered by en- abling LLMs to continuously reason from scratch through the cumulative retrieval of documents(Trivedi et al. 2023; Zhou et al. 2024), due to the limited useful information in arXiv:2501.05475v1 [cs.CL] 7 Jan 2025 documents, excessive retrieval would introduce much more noise information which distracts LLMs to engage in over- reasoning and build erroneous correlation, thereby generates hallucinatory content(Yu et al. 2023; Chiang and Lee 2024; Wu et al. 2024; Liu et al. 2024). To address these issues, we refer the investigative process of the detective, that iteratively collates evidence to gather all related factual information, and through evidence discov- ery process to validate the relevance of evidence then update them, while uncovering unresolved issues along the way, to ultimately reach a valid conclusion. By continuously revis- ing and reconstructing the reasoning chain through the evi- dence collation and discovery process, a comprehensive
