Due to our work’s design of generation of inferential evidence and updating of evidence, which sup- presses the introduction of noisy information and achieves a retroactive-progressive reasoning structure, achieving the best performance above all baselines on both datasets.

The results are shown in Table 2. Ablation of structure As shown in Table 2, it is evident that removing either
