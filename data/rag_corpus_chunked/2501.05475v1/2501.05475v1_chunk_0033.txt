lines in semantic perspective on all three datasets, This in- dicates that our approach demonstrates more stable and re- liable performance across various scenarios. Also, we ob- served that some baselines with unidirectional forward rea- soning paradigm, exhibit performance degradation when en- countering simple questions with single-hop. For instance, Self-Ask may degrade to standard prompting, ReAct may degrade to CoT, and SearChain may degrade to RAG. This highlights once again the necessaries of constructing a retroactive reasoning process.
