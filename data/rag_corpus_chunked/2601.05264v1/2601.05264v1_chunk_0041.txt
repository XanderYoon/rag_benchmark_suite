Critical Trust Vulnerability Matrix RAG systems generate numerous trust surfaces that may be compromised by a variety of attack vectors [148]. The vulnerability landscape encom- passes four critical layers: citation attribution accuracy, generation fidelity, retrieval mechanism security, and knowledge base integrity [149].

The BadRAG framework demonstrates that the injection of only 10 malicious passages results in high attack success rates while remaining difficult to detect [143]. 8.2.1 Corpus Manipulation and Data Poisoning Data poisoning is one of the most critical vulnerabilities in RAG systems, as it occurs when malicious actors inject harmful or misleading information into external knowledge bases [151][152]. The Phantom framework, which employs a two-stage malicious passage optimization expressly designed to exploit RAG vulnerabilities, is one of the sophisticated techniques that at- tackers can employ [153].
