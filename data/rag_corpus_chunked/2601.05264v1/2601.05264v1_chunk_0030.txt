metrics offer computational efficiency and interpretability [104]. 32 Table 7.5: Traditional vs Modern Evaluation Comparison Evaluation Aspect Traditional Metrics Modern LLM-based Hybrid Approaches Semantic Understanding Limited Excellent Good Computational Cost Very Low High Medium Human Correlation Low-Medium Very High High Reference Requirement Always Optional Flexible Interpretability High Medium High Scalability Excellent Limited Good Domain Adaptation Poor Excellent Good Real-time Capability Excellent Poor Good Modern evaluation frameworks are increasingly incorporating hybrid ap- proaches that combine the semantic sophistication of LLM-based judges with the efficacy of traditional metrics [104]. This combination allows for scalable evaluation while preserving a high degree of correlation with hu- man assessment, which is especially crucial for production RAG systems that necessitate real-time performance monitoring [101]. 6.6 Benchmarking Datasets and Standards Standardized benchmarking enables the objective comparison of RAG sys- tems and offers industry reference points for performance evaluation across a variety of domains and task types [93]. The primary objective of contem- porary benchmarking initiatives is to develop exhaustive evaluation suites that evaluate RAG performance across multiple dimensions [94].
