Research Low- Medium Low- Medium 5.8 Architectural Evolution and Trade-offs The evolution of RAG architectures reflects the field's progression from simple retrieval-generation pipelines to sophisticated systems capable of complex reasoning, multi-modal processing, and autonomous optimization. Each architectural paradigm addresses specific limitations while introducing distinct trade-offs in complexity, resource requirements, and domain applica- bility. The choice of architecture depends critically on application require- ments, available computational resources, and acceptable implementation complexity. Current research trends indicate convergence toward hybrid approaches that combine multiple paradigms, particularly the integration of graph- augmented capabilities with agentic frameworks for enterprise-scale deployments. Future developments will likely focus on standardization of evaluation metrics and development of unified frameworks that abstract architectural complexity while maintaining performance advantages. 27 6 Evaluation and Benchmarking Framework Due to their multi-component architecture, the systematic evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems presents distinctive chal- lenges, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation of retrieval quality, genera- tion accuracy, and system trustworthiness [93]. Incorporating sophisticated frameworks that utilize large language models as judges, modern RAG eval- uation has progressed beyond conventional metrics, thereby facilitating a more nuanced evaluation of contextual relevance and semantic similarity [94]. Both component-level and end-to-end evaluation approaches are re- quired to identify performance constraints and optimization opportunities throughout the retrieval-generation pipeline due to the complexity of RAG systems [95]. Operational playbooks recommend coupling offline bench- marks with online telemetry (latency, CTR, deflection rate) and human review queues for drift control [86]. 6.1 Comparative Analysis of RAG Evaluation Frameworks In an effort to mitigate the constraints of conventional metrics, contempo- rary RAG evaluation frameworks have emerged. These frameworks offer automated assessment capabilities that minimize manual evaluation burden while preserving a high degree of correlation with human judgment [96]. Typically, these frameworks employ sophisticated scoring mechanisms to evaluate retrieval relevance, generation faithfulness, and answer quality on
