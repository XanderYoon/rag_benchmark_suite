Static FiD [15], RAG [1] Rule-based workflows Limited Agentic AutoRAG [22], Self-RAG [24] Model-driven adaptation High 4.6 Architectural Integration Patterns Modern RAG systems increasingly combine multiple taxonomic dimensions to address specific application requirements. The taxonomy enables sys- tematic analysis of architectural trade-offs across retrieval strategies, fusion mechanisms, modality support, trust calibration, and adaptivity levels. Integration patterns emerge where latency-critical applications employ single-pass retrieval with early fusion, while complex reasoning tasks utilize multi-hop retrieval with agentic coordination. Trust calibration mechanisms integrate across all architectural dimensions to ensure reliable operation. Table 4.4: Architectural Integration Patterns in RAG Systems Pattern Type Use Case Key Charac- teristics Strengths Trade-offs / Challenges Single-Pass Early Fusion Latency- sensitive applications (e.g., real-time assistants) One-shot retrieval; early fusion; low coordination Low latency; simple architecture Limited depth; lower robustness Multi-Hop Late Fusion Complex reasoning tasks (e.g., legal/medical diagnostics) Iterative multi-hop retrieval; fusion post-retrieval; deep reasoning Rich reasoning; higher context fidelity Higher latency; resource intensive 18 Pattern Type Use Case Key Charac- teristics Strengths Trade-offs / Challenges Agent- Orchestrated Retrieval Dynamic goal-driven systems (e.g., agentic planning) Agent controls retrieval and reasoning; modular components Flexible; composable; autonomous decision flow Design complexity; trust assurance needed Hybrid Fusion with Modality- Aware Pipelines Multimodal RAG (e.g., image+text QA) Supports multiple modalities; aligns diverse data; fusion via sync Supports rich multimodal inputs Modality sync overhead; complex integration Trust- Calibrated Adaptive Pattern High-stakes decision systems (e.g., finance, safety-critical domains) Uses trust metrics; adaptive context weighting; source filtering High reliability; inter- pretability Requires sophisti- cated trust modeling 4.7 Design Implications This taxonomy offers a structured framework for the examination of RAG architectural diversity in accordance with five critical dimensions. The clas- sification facilitates the systematic comparison of design choices and the identification of architectural patterns that are appropriate for specific ap- plication domains.
