The clas- sification facilitates the systematic comparison of design choices and the identification of architectural patterns that are appropriate for specific ap- plication domains. The field's evolution toward more sophisticated knowledge assimilation ca- pabilities is reflected in the progression from static, single-modal systems to adaptive, multi-modal architectures. Each dimensional choice introduces specific trade-offs that must be meticulously balanced against computational constraints and application requirements. 5 Architectural Innovations in RAG Significant architectural innovations have characterized the evolution of Retrieval-Augmented Generation, which have addressed the fundamental 19 limitations of canonical RAG systems. Sophisticated capabilities for com- plex reasoning, multi-modal processing, and autonomous optimization have also been introduced by these innovations. Six noteworthy architectural paradigms that have emerged from cutting-edge research and have been broadly adopted in the industry are examined in this section. 5.1 RAG-Fusion: Multi-Perspective Query Processing RAG-Fusion is a paradigm shift from single-query retrieval to multi- perspective information collection, which is accomplished by employing sophisticated query rewriting and rank fusion methodologies [17], [48]. The fundamental limitation that a single user query frequently fails to encompass the complete scope of information requirements, particularly for complex knowledge-intensive duties, is effectively addressed by RAG-Fusion. 5.1.1Pipeline Architecture The RAG-Fusion pipeline is comprised of three stages: query diversification, parallel retrieval, and reciprocal rank fusion (RRF). The mathematical foun- dation is based on reciprocal rank fusion with parameterk= 60, which has become the industry standard due to empirical substantiation across multi- ple domains [49]. RRF(d) = ∑ r∈R 1 k+rankr(d) whereRdenotes the set of retrieval results and rankr(d)signifies the rank of documentdin the result setr. 5.1.1 Enterprise Implementation Microsoft's implementation shows substantial improvements over
