com- pleteness of the retrieved context, which is why retrieval evaluation is the cornerstone of RAG system assessment [100]. Modern retrieval metrics in- corporate RAG-specific considerations, such as context utilization and frag- ment attribution, in addition to traditional information retrieval measures [101].

This concept pro- vides comprehensive coverage of hallucination detection across each bound- ary of the RAG architecture [102]. Context relevance evaluates the extent to which the retrieved fragments contain information that is pertinent to the input query, whereas groundedness evaluates the extent to which the generated responses are adequately substantiated by the retrieved evidence [102]. 6.3 Generation Quality Metrics Sophisticated metrics that can assess semantic similarity, factual consis- tency, and contextual appropriateness beyond surface-level text matching are necessary for generation quality assessment in RAG systems [103]. In order to conduct an exhaustive evaluation of generation quality, contempo- rary evaluation frameworks implement both conventional NLP metrics and sophisticated LLM-based judges [104].
