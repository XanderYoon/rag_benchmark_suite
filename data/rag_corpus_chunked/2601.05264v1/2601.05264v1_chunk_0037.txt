When the retrieved information exceeds the model context windows, context truncation failures occur, resulting in incomplete or distorted responses [124]. 7.3 Architecture Patterns for Scalable RAG Systems Operational efficiency, maintainability, and scalability necessitate meticu- lously designed architectures in production RAG systems [125]. According to organizational constraints, team capabilities, and deployment require- ments, various architectural patterns provide distinct advantages [126]. 7.3.1 Component Architecture Patterns Scalability and maintainability challenges are addressed by contemporary RAG systems through the implementation of a variety of architectural pat- terns [127]. These patterns have an impact on the velocity of development, the complexity of the system, and the operational overhead [128].

Event-driven patterns enhance system resilience by facilitating asynchronous processing and enhancing the management of traffic surges [112]. 7.3.2 Deployment and Orchestration Strategies The deployment of a RAG system necessitates the meticulous coordination of
