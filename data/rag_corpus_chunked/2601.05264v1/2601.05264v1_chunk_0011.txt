particularly effective in the following applications: High-suitability domains: Question answering that is based on Wikipedia, in which the knowledge corpus is consistent with the training data and the queries adhere to predetermined patterns. The system's capacity to generate prompt, source-based responses is advantageous for customer support applications. Medium-suitability domains: The need for sophisticated evidence cal- ibration and domain-specific reasoning that may surpass the canonical ar- chitecture's capabilities presents challenges in scientific fact-checking. Limited-suitability domains: Legal document analysis is plagued by in- adequate traceability mechanisms and context truncation issues. The archi- tectural constraints of the static pipeline are frequently exceeded by complex reasoning tasks that necessitate multi-step inference. 3.6 Evolution Toward Agentic Architectures An architectural philosophy fundamental shift is represented by the transi- tion from canonical to agentic RAG systems. While canonical RAG adheres to a deterministic pipeline from query to retrieval to generation, agentic systems incorporate intelligent decision-making components that facilitate dynamic adaptation based on query complexity and intermediate results. 12 Table 3.3: Canonical vs. Agentic RAG Comparison Aspect Canonical RAG Agentic RAG Pipeline Structure Linear, predetermined Dynamic, adaptive Decision Making Rule-based LLM-driven planning Retrieval Strategy Single-pass Multi-hop, iterative Error Handling Limited Self-correction mechanisms Complexity Low High Flexibility Constrained Highly adaptable Figure 3.1 isA visual comparison of two essential RAG principles. Canon- ical RAG systems follow a predetermined process that progresses from dense retrieval to sequence generation. Agentic or multi-agent RAG systems em- ploy a modular architecture that includes planner and retrieval agents, en- abling dynamic reasoning and iterative refinement based on query complex- ity and generation confidence.

The canonical architecture establishes a strong foundation while simultaneously emphasizing
