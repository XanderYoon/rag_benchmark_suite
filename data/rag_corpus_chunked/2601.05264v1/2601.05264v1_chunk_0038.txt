Very High Low Heterogeneous technology platforms and deployment strategies are sup- ported by microservices architectures, which enable the independent scaling of retrieval, indexing, and generation components [129]. Event-driven patterns enhance system resilience by facilitating asynchronous processing and enhancing the management of traffic surges [112]. 7.3.2 Deployment and Orchestration Strategies The deployment of a RAG system necessitates the meticulous coordination of numerous components, each of which has distinct scaling characteristics and resource requirements [113]. Orchestration strategies that are effective are those that maintain a balance between operational complexity, cost, and performance [114].

Serverless deployments provide exceptionalcostefficacyforvariableworkloads; however, theymayintroduce cold start latencies [116]. Teams are equipped with the requisite knowledge of engineering patterns and anti-patterns to construct scalable, resilient RAG systems that operate consistently in production environments. Throughout the system's lifecycle, success necessitates meticulous attention to both operational considerations and technical implementation details. 8 Trust, Alignment, and Safety in RAG The deployment of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in en- terprise environments presents intricate challenges regarding trust, align- ment, and safety that surpass conventional language model concerns [140]. Comprehensive frameworks are required to guarantee system reliability and user safety, as RAG architectures generate complex trust surfaces that con- solidate retrieved information, source credibility, and generation quality [141]. Recent research has demonstrated that the use of RAG significantly increases the peril of even the most
