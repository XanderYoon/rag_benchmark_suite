The RAGAS evaluation system offers structured metrics for evalu- ating context precision, faithfulness, answer relevancy, and context recall [171][172]. Bias Detection and Mitigation RAG systems may unintentionally propagate biases associated with sensi- tive demographic attributes, requiring systematic evaluation and mitigation strategies [173]. Multiple bias mitigation approaches have demonstrated ef- fectiveness including Chain-of-Thought reasoning, Counterfactual filtering, and Majority Vote aggregation [173]. Recent overviews propose systematic pipelines for bias identification and mitigation specific to RAG [174].
