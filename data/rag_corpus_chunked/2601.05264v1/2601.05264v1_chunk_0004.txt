critical nature of numerous RAG deployments. 4 1.4 Article Contributions and Research Foundation By conducting a comprehensive, technically rigorous, and critical assessment of the field, this survey endeavors to unify the fragmented landscape of RAG architectures. The primary contributions, which are derived from an exhaustive systematic literature review, are as follows: A Comprehensive Architectural Taxonomy: We present a systematic categorization of RAG systems that is based on retrieval logic, fusion topol- ogy, modality, adaptivity, and trust calibration mechanisms, as determined by the analysis of architectural studies. In order to facilitate academic and industrial deployments, this taxonomy is intended to be both extensible and implementation-agnostic. EmpiricalAnalysisandBenchmarking: Weprovideanexhaustiveeval- uation of architectural trade-offs, performance characteristics, and deploy- ment considerations across diverse organizational contexts by consolidating performance trends across major RAG benchmarks. Engineering Best Practices: Using enterprise case studies and produc- tion deployments, we identify critical anti-patterns and proven engineering patterns that impact robustness, factuality, and latency. We have identi- fied systematic patterns in successful implementations and common failure modes through our analysis. Trust and Safety Modeling: We provide a formal analysis of trust sur- faces in RAG systems, grounded in safety-oriented literature. Our discourse encompasses abstention strategies, citation grounding, red teaming method- ology, andquantitativetrustevaluationmethodsverifiedthroughproduction implementations. Frontier Directions: Through a gap analysis of the current literature, we delineate nascent research trajectories and unresolved issues in autonomous assessment systems, multi-agent coordination, and differentiable training, highlighting domains with considerable promise for improvement. 2 Systematic Literature Review Methodology 2.1 Review Protocol and Scope This comprehensive survey implements a systematic literature review (SLR) methodology that is consistent with the well-established standards for soft- ware engineering research [3] and extends them to the AI/ML areas. The 5 review protocol was developed to guarantee comprehensive coverage, reduce bias, and generate reproducible results for the constantly changing RAG field. While confronting
