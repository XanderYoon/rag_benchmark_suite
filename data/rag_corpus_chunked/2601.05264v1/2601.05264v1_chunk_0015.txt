knowledge formats. Examples include Vision-RAG [45] for visual information processing and KG-RAG [19] for structured knowledge integration. AVA-RAG extends these ideas to audio-visual pipelines with memory-augmented agents for cross-modal grounding [46]. Table 4.2: Knowledge Source Modality 16 Modality Type Example Systems Supported Knowledge Formats Text-only RAG [1], Atlas [44] Unstructured text documents Structured KG-RAG [19], Table-RAG [20] Knowledge graphs, tabular data Multi-modal Vision-RAG [45], AVA-RAG [46] Images, videos, mixed formats 4.4 Trust Calibration Mechanisms Trust calibration becomes indispensable for the purpose of managing un- certainty and guaranteeing reliability as RAG systems are implemented in critical applications: Abstention mechanisms:As incorporated in Learn-to-Refuse [47], ab- stention mechanisms allow models to decline responses when confidence lev- els are insufficient. These systems employ uncertainty quantification to de- termine when knowledge gaps obstruct reliable generation. Citation strategies:WebGPT [25] and RAGAS [27] have both demon- strated that citation strategies facilitate provenance tracing and evidence traceability. These methods facilitate the verification of generated content against source materials and increase transparency. 4.5 Pipeline Adaptivity The system's ability to adapt to evolving information requirements is deter- mined by pipeline adaptivity. Static pipelines:Static pipelines adhere to predetermined, rule-based op- erations, as demonstrated by the original RAG [1] implementations. These systems exhibit consistent computational requirements and predictable be- havior. Agentic systems:Agentic systems dynamically coordinate retrieval and generationprocessesbyemployingmodelreasoning. AutoRAG[22]andSelf- RAG [24] are adaptive frameworks that facilitate context-aware decision- making.

The taxonomy enables sys- tematic analysis of architectural trade-offs across retrieval strategies, fusion mechanisms, modality support, trust calibration, and adaptivity levels.
