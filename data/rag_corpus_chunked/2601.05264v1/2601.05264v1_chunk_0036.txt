updates in accordance with the volatility of information and the patterns of user access [132]. 7.2 Anti-Patterns: Common Failure Modes and Mitigation Strategies RAG systems demonstrate recurring failure patterns that have a substan- tial effect on user confidence, reliability, and performance [133]. Proactive prevention and early detection of system degradation are made possible by comprehending these anti-patterns [134]. 7.2.1 Retrieval Failure Modes The most prevalent cause of RAG system degradation is retrieval failures, which are evident in a variety of ways at different phases of the retrieval pipeline [135]. These defects may manifest during the query processing, document matching, or result ranking phases [136]. Table 8.4: Retrieval Failure Mode Classification Failure Mode Frequency Impact Severity Detection Difficulty Mitigation Complexity Missing Content High High Low Medium Poor Ranking Very High Medium Medium Medium Context Overflow Medium High Low Low Query Misinter- pretation Medium High High High Index Staleness High Medium Low Medium Missing content failures are occasions in which retrieval mechanisms are in- capable of locating pertinent information that is present in the knowledge base [137]. Poor ranking issues are evident when pertinent documents are retrieved but incorrectly prioritized, resulting in suboptimal context for gen- eration [138]. 7.2.2 Generation Quality Anti-Patterns The retrieval phase is frequently the source of generation quality issues, but they can also result from prompt engineering deficiencies, context man- 40 agement failings, or model limitations [121]. The user experience and the credibility of the system are directly influenced by these anti-patterns [122].
