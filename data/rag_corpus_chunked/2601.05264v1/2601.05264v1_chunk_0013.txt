and use cases by comprehending these fundamen- tal trade-offs. The canonical architecture continues to be pertinent as a foundation and building block for more sophisticated implementations that overcome its inherent limitations by utilizing specialized components and adaptive mechanisms. 14 4 Taxonomy of RAG Architectures The rapid proliferation of contemporary Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems has prompted the necessity of a systematic architectural classification. This section provides a comprehensive taxonomy that is orga- nized across five critical classification dimensions: adaptivity, trust calibra- tion, modality, fusion mechanism, and retrieval strategy. These dimensions denote essential architectural decisions that have a direct impact on the performance and deployment characteristics of the system. A practitioner- oriented survey enumerates eight recurring RAG architecture patterns used in the wild [139]. 4.1 Retrieval Strategy The retrieval strategy is the primary factor that dictates the manner and timing of external knowledge retrieval during generation. Three primary paradigms are identified as a result of the interaction patterns with the retrieval corpus: Single-pass retrievalmethods, such as RAG-Token [1] and FiD [15], re- trieve documents only once per query. These methodologies emphasize com- putational efficiency by expediting retrieval operations. Iterative retrievalmethods, such as Active-RAG [16] and FLARE [42], re-examine the corpus as generation progresses. On the basis of interme- diate generation states, these systems facilitate the dynamic acquisition of knowledge. Multi-hop retrievalmethods decompose complex queries into sequential subquestions across multiple retrieval stages, as demonstrated by Know- Trace [43] and ReAct-RAG [23]. This method facilitates systemic reasoning across interconnected knowledge elements.
