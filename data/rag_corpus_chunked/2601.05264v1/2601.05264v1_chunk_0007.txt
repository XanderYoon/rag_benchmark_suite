review process. This source base is diverse and offers a balanced perspective on both theoretical ad- vancements and practical deployment experiences. Source Classification and Analysis Structured analysis was facilitated by the systematic classification of sources across multiple dimensions: Publication Type:Academic conference papers, journal articles, industry reports, technicaldocumentation, open-sourceimplementations, anddeploy- ment case studies. Architectural Focus:Agentic architectures, hybrid implementations, trust calibration approaches, retrieval strategies, and canonical RAG systems. Domain Application:Domain-specific applications, general query an- swering, enterprise deployments, research prototypes, and production sys- tems. Technical Contribution:Empirical evaluations, implementation frame- works, performance optimizations, deployment methodologies, and novel ar- chitectural proposals. Data Extraction and Synthesis Procedures Systematic data extraction was employed to obtain critical technical specifi- cations, architectural characteristics, performance metrics, implementation details, and deployment considerations. Standardized extraction templates guaranteed consistency among sources while simultaneously accommodating a variety of technical approaches and publication formats. Architectural Data:System components, integration patterns, scalability characteristics, computational requirements, and deployment architectures. Performance Metrics:User experience factors, resource utilization, cost considerations, latency characteristics, and accuracy measurements, when available and verifiable. Implementation Details:Technical specifications, platform require- ments, operational considerations, and integration strategies for practical deployment. 8 2.5 Methodological Rigor and Validation Multiple validation mechanisms are integrated into the systematic review methodology to guarantee reproducibility and reliability: Selection Process Validation The transparent evaluation of the application of selection criteria is facil- itated by the systematic documentation of inclusion/exclusion decisions. Quality assessment procedures adhere to established systematic review best practices, with a focus on methodological consistency. Synthesis Approach Theliteraturesynthesisutilizesstructuredanalyticalframeworkstoorganize findings across architectural dimensions, performance characteristics, and implementation patterns. While maintaining analytical rigor, this method guarantees comprehensive coverage. Bias Mitigation Numerous strategies are employed to mitigate potential selection and anal- ysis bias, such as transparent synthesis procedures, systematic quality as- sessment, comprehensive search strategies, and diverse source types. 2.6 Methodological Foundation This methodology for systematic literature
