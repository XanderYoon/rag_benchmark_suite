2.3 Selection Criteria and Quality Assessment Inclusion Criteria 6 In order to guarantee quality and relevance, the review implemented sys- tematic inclusion criteria: •Publications that concentrate predominantly on RAG systems, archi- tectures, or implementations •Quantitative evaluation components in empirical studies •Technical implementation details are included in architectural propos- als. •Case studies and production deployment scenarios •Technical documentation from well-established AI/ML platforms and frameworks Quality Assessment Framework In order to guarantee methodological rigor and practical relevance, each source was subjected to a systematic quality assessment across multiple dimensions: Technical Soundness:Evaluation of the quality of statistical analysis, the appropriateness of the experimental design, and the potential for repro- ducibility. A clear problem formulation, appropriate baseline comparisons, and transparent evaluation metrics were evaluated in the sources. Methodological Transparency:Evaluation of the appropriateness of the result interpretation, the clarity of the experimental setup, the provision of implementation details, and the quality of the documentation. Studies that provided adequate detail for replication and validation were prioritized. Relevance and Contribution:Analysis of the direct relevance to RAG systems, contribution to architectural comprehension, practical applicabil- ity, and advancement of field knowledge. Core research concerns were pri- oritized in the selection of sources. Reproducibility and Validation:Evaluation metric standardization, ex- perimental reproducibility, appropriateness of baseline comparisons, and generalizability across domains and applications. 2.4 Literature Analysis and Synthesis A comprehensive compilation of high-quality sources, including academic publications, industry reports, technical documentation, and implementa- 7 tion guides, was the outcome of the systematic review process. This source base is diverse and offers a balanced perspective on both theoretical ad- vancements and practical deployment experiences. Source Classification and Analysis Structured analysis was facilitated by the systematic classification of sources across multiple dimensions: Publication Type:Academic conference papers, journal articles, industry reports, technicaldocumentation, open-sourceimplementations, anddeploy- ment case studies. Architectural Focus:Agentic architectures, hybrid implementations, trust calibration approaches,
