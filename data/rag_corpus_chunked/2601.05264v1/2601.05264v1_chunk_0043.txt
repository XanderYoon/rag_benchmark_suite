To proactively identify vulnerabilities before they can be exploited, red teaming involves simulating adversarial attacks [161]. Red Teaming Implementation Framework A comprehensive red teaming program should incorporate systematic test- ing protocols that address the security of the knowledge base, the integrity of retrieval, and the robustness of generation [162]. The significance of special- ized red teaming is illustrated by healthcare implementations, which involve expert teams undertaking systematic evaluations using structured prompt sets [150].
