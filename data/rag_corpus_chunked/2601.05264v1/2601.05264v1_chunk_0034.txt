and prompt/response policies, alongside retrieval reliability tests [87]. 7.1.1 Document Processing and Chunking Strategies Chunking strategies are essential for the accuracy of responses and the qual- ity of retrievals, which are the foundation of any successful RAG system [120]. Depending on the use case, document formats, and performance re- quirements, various chunking approaches provide distinct advantages [121].

Semantic windowing techniques improve context preserva- tion by generating segments that are based on semantic boundaries rather than defined character counts [123]. These sophisticated methods necessi- tate a meticulous equilibrium between computational efficiency and retrieval coverage [124]. 7.1.2 Retrieval Quality and Confidence Mechanisms Sophisticated confidence thresholds and quality barriers are implemented in production RAG systems to prevent the contamination of the generation process by low-quality retrievals [125]. When high-quality information is un- available, these mechanisms facilitate appropriate abstention behavior and graceful degradation [126].
