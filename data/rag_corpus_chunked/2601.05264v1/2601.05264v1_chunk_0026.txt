of RAG Evaluation Frameworks In an effort to mitigate the constraints of conventional metrics, contempo- rary RAG evaluation frameworks have emerged. These frameworks offer automated assessment capabilities that minimize manual evaluation burden while preserving a high degree of correlation with human judgment [96]. Typically, these frameworks employ sophisticated scoring mechanisms to evaluate retrieval relevance, generation faithfulness, and answer quality on a multi-dimensional scale [97]. Automatic long-form evaluators such as ALCE complement LLM-judge pipelines by targeting coherence and discourse-level faithfulness [26].

This is achieved through four core metrics: faithful- ness, answer relevancy, context precision, and context recall [98]. Detailed evaluation of both retrieval and generation components is facilitated by Lla- maIndex's extensive evaluation modules, which include correctness, seman- tic similarity, faithfulness, context relevancy, answer relevancy, and guideline adherence [99]. 6.2 Retrieval Quality Assessment The quality of generation is directly influenced by the relevance and com- pleteness of the retrieved context, which is why retrieval evaluation is the cornerstone of RAG system assessment [100]. Modern retrieval metrics in- corporate RAG-specific considerations, such as context utilization and frag- ment attribution, in addition to traditional information retrieval measures [101].
