conversational interfaces and shorter text generation tasks, as it calculates precision, recall, and F1 measures by align- ing contextually similar utterances between candidate and reference texts [108]. 6.4 Assessment of Safety and Trustworthiness Critical concerns regarding hallucination detection, factual consistency, and appropriate uncertainty management in RAG systems are addressed by 31 trustworthiness evaluation [109]. In enterprise deployments, where inaccu- rate information can have substantial repercussions, these metrics become indispensable [110]. Table 7.4: Trustworthiness Metrics Implementation Metric Assessment Method Accuracy vs Human Detection Capability Implementation Diffi- culty Production Readiness Groundedness LLM- based verifica- tion 85-92% Factual inconsistency Medium High Citation Accuracy Automated attribu- tion 80-90% Source mis- attribution High Medium Hallucination Rate Multi- method detection 75-88% False information Very High Medium Context Adher- ence Entailment checking 78-85% Context deviation Medium High Completeness Coverage assessment 70-82% Information gaps High Medium RAGChecker offers a comprehensive set of metrics, including overall per- formance measures (precision, recall, F1), retriever-specific metrics (claim recall, context precision), and generator-specific metrics (context utilization, noise sensitivity, hallucination, self-knowledge, faithfulness) [95], which are assessed through claim-level entailment checking. This framework facilitates the targeted enhancement of RAG system performance by facilitating the comprehensive diagnosis of both retrieval and generation components [95]. 6.5 Traditional vs Modern Evaluation Approaches The fundamental shift in RAG assessment methodologies is represented by the transition from conventional NLP metrics to sophisticated LLM-based evaluation [103]. Modern methods exhibit a superior correlation with human judgment and semantic comprehension, whereas traditional metrics offer computational efficiency and interpretability [104]. 32 Table 7.5: Traditional vs Modern Evaluation Comparison Evaluation Aspect Traditional Metrics Modern LLM-based Hybrid Approaches Semantic Understanding Limited Excellent Good Computational Cost Very Low High Medium Human Correlation Low-Medium Very High High Reference Requirement Always Optional Flexible Interpretability High Medium High Scalability Excellent Limited Good Domain Adaptation Poor Excellent Good Real-time Capability
