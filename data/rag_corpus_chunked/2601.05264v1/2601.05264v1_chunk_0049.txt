This method provides advanced reasoning, planning, and execution capabilities that surpass the constraints of single-agent systems [189][190]. 9.3.1 Architectures for Agent Specialization and Coordination The MA-RAG framework illustrates how multi-agent systems can resolve the inherent ambiguities and reasoning challenges that arise in intricate information-seeking tasks [187]. This framework orchestrates specialized agents, such as the Planner, Step Definer, Extractor, and QA Agents, to address each stage of the RAG pipeline using task-aware reasoning [187]. In comparison to baseline RAG systems, the hierarchical multi-agent approach obtains significant enhancements in question classification and answer accu- racy [190]. 9.3.2 Revolutionary Multi-Agent Implementations The orchestrator-worker pattern is implemented in Anthropic's multi-agent research system, in which a main agent oversees the process and delegated it to specialized subagents that operate in parallel [189]. This architecture employs a multi-step search process that dynamically identifies pertinent information, adjusts to new discoveries, and analyzes the results to produce high-quality responses [189].

These systems preserve temporal coherence and adaptive memory management while integrating text, images, audio, video, and structured data into unified representations [180][192]. 9.4.1 Multimodal Representations That Are Unified Three primary approaches are employed by advanced multimodal RAG sys- tems: unified embedding spaces, grounding modalities to text, and discrete datastores with reranking [180][192]. The unified embedding approach em- ploys models such as CLIP to
