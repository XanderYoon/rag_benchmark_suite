The literature has indicated the emergence of three primary fusion paradigms: Early fusion:According to FiD [15], early fusion incorporates all retrieved documents simultaneously prior to decoding. Joint attention mechanisms are enabled across all evidence sources through this method. Late fusion:Late fusion is exemplified by RAG-Sequence [1], which pro- cesses each document independently before aggregating results. In addition to implementation flexibility, this modular approach provides computational efficiency. Marginal fusion:The implementation of RAG-Fusion [17] demonstrates the use of retrieval-aware scoring during decoding processes. Computational requirements are balanced with the quality of evidence integration in this approach. 4.3 Modality of Knowledge Sources RAG systems are increasingly able to accommodate a variety of knowledge modalities that extend beyond conventional text corpora: Mono-modal systems:Traditional implementations such as Atlas [44] and FiD [15] are mono-modal systems that exclusively operate with textual knowledge sources. While emphasizing text-based reasoning, these systems preserve computational simplicity. For structured data, Table-RAG demon- strates table-aware retrieval and fusion that outperform text-only variants on tabular QA [20]. Multi-modal systems:During retrieval, multi-modal systems integrate structured data, images, or heterogeneous knowledge formats. Examples include Vision-RAG [45] for visual information processing and KG-RAG [19] for structured knowledge integration. AVA-RAG extends these ideas to audio-visual pipelines with memory-augmented agents for cross-modal grounding [46].
