consistency. Synthesis Approach Theliteraturesynthesisutilizesstructuredanalyticalframeworkstoorganize findings across architectural dimensions, performance characteristics, and implementation patterns. While maintaining analytical rigor, this method guarantees comprehensive coverage. Bias Mitigation Numerous strategies are employed to mitigate potential selection and anal- ysis bias, such as transparent synthesis procedures, systematic quality as- sessment, comprehensive search strategies, and diverse source types. 2.6 Methodological Foundation This methodology for systematic literature review establishes a rigorous foundation for the exhaustive examination of RAG architectural patterns and implementations. The methodology strikes a balance between practical applicability and methodological rigor, guaranteeing both academic quality and industry relevance. The systematic approach ensures transparency and reproducibility through- out the review process, allowing for the identification of key architectural trends, performance trade-offs, and implementation patterns. This method- ology facilitates the advancement of architectural insights and taxonomic frameworks that are elaborated upon in subsequent sections. 3 The Canonical RAG Pipeline Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are a revolutionary ar- chitectural approach that surpasses the constraints of traditional language models by incorporating external retrieval as a primary inductive bias. 9 Canonical RAG pipelines establish a closely integrated interaction between a differentiable retriever, which is typically based on dense vectors, and an autoregressive generator, such as BART or T5, resulting in a synergistic mechanism in which contextual relevance and generative fluency evolve concurrently [1], [15]. 3.1 Canonical Architecture: DPR + BART/T5 as the Foun- dational Blueprint The canonical design, which was initially devised by Lewis et al. [1], com- prises a Dense Passage Retriever (DPR) that has been trained with dual- encoder contrastive objectives and a pretrained sequence-to-sequence gen- erator such as BART [33] or T5 [34]. The architectural blueprint for subse- quent RAG system developments has been established by this foundational pattern [35]. In response to a query q, the retriever calculates inner product similarity to identify a set of
