challenges regarding trust, align- ment, and safety that surpass conventional language model concerns [140]. Comprehensive frameworks are required to guarantee system reliability and user safety, as RAG architectures generate complex trust surfaces that con- solidate retrieved information, source credibility, and generation quality [141]. Recent research has demonstrated that the use of RAG significantly increases the peril of even the most secure language models, as external knowledge sources introduce new attack vectors and failure modes [142]. The critical significance of trust in RAG systems is highlighted by their deployment in high-stakes sectors such as healthcare, finance, and legal ser- vices, where system failures can lead to substantial harm, liability, or reg- ulatory violations [143]. The trust issues in RAG systems are inherently distinct from those in standalone LLMs, as they introduce additional fail- ure modes throughout the retrieval pipeline, knowledge base integrity, and citation attribution processes [144]. In order to gain a comprehensive understanding of the systemic risks that are inherent in Retrieval, Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, we have developed a multi-layered Trust Vulnerability Map, as shown in Figure 9.1. 43 This map delineates the primary sources of failure throughout the archi- tectural framework. Traditional trust issues in LLMs primarily concentrate on hallucination and bias in the generator. However, RAG systems incorpo- rate additional trust dimensions that encompass the retriever and knowledge base upstream, as well as citation and attribution methods downstream. The Knowledge Base layer is vulnerable to data poisoning, outdated or ab- sent knowledge, and biases in structural curation, as illustrated in Figure 9.1. The Retriever layer may be susceptible to hostile queries that exploit ranking algorithms or exacerbate source bias. The Generator is suscepti- ble to hallucinations, particularly when presented with token truncation or nonsensical input, despite the benefits of enhanced context. In the final analysis, the Citation
