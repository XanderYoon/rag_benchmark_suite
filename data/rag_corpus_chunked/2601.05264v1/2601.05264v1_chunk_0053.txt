The emergence of genuinely next-generation RAG systems that transcend current limita- tions and open up new possibilities for AI applications is represented by this convergence [201][200]. Principles of Unified Architecture Design Next-generation systems utilize sophisticated modular architectures that fa- cilitate the flexible integration of advanced capabilities while preserving sys- tem coherence and performance [177][202]. The Patchwork framework is a primeexampleofthisapproach, asitoffersacomprehensiveend-to-endRAG servingframeworkthatresolvesefficiencyconstraintsbyutilizingdistributed inference optimization and flexible specification
