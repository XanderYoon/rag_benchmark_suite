production deployments in a variety of enterprise envi- ronments, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have developed into a mature engineering discipline [112]. This evolution has uncovered critical design patterns that improve the reliability, performance, and main- tainability of the system, while also revealing anti-patterns that systemat- ically undermine its efficacy [113]. It is imperative for engineering teams to comprehend these patterns and anti-patterns in order to create RAG architectures that are reliable, scalable, and trustworthy in production en- vironments [114]. The multi-component architecture of RAG systems is the source of their complexity, as retrieval mechanisms, knowledge bases, and generation mod- 36 els must operate in tandem to provide contextually pertinent, precise re- sponses [115]. Real-world deployments have resulted in the development of engineering best practices, which offer teams systematic guidance as they develop production-ready systems [116]. In contrast, organizations repeat- edly confront systematic engineering errors during RAG implementation, which are represented by common failure modes and anti-patterns [117]. 7.1 Design Best Practices: Foundational Engineering Pat- terns RAG implementations that are successful adhere to established engineer- ing patterns that address fundamental challenges in operational monitoring, system resilience, retrieval quality, and document processing [118]. Current best practices in RAG system engineering are represented by these pat- terns, which have been validated across multiple production environments [119]. Cloud guidance on choosing RAG options highlights trade-offs among vector search, hybrid retrieval, and reranking services [88]. Enterprise guid- ance emphasizes governance guardrails, PII filtering, citation checks, and prompt/response policies, alongside retrieval reliability tests [87]. 7.1.1 Document Processing and Chunking Strategies Chunking strategies are essential for the accuracy of responses and the qual- ity of retrievals, which are the foundation of any successful RAG system [120]. Depending on the use case, document formats, and performance re- quirements, various chunking approaches provide distinct advantages [121]. Table 8.1: Document
