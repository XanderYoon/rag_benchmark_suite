Engineering the RAG Stack: A Comprehensive Review of the Architecture and Trust Frameworks for Retrieval Augmented Generation Systems Dean Wampler, Ph.D. Head of Technology, The AI Alliance IBM Research dean@deanwampler.com ORCID: 0000-0002-6127-7543 Dave Nielson Head of Community, The AI Alliance IBM Research Alireza Seddighi, Ph.D. AI Research Engineer Individual Contributor, The AI Alliance Abstract This article provides a comprehensive systematic literature review of academic studies, industrial applications, and real-world deploy- ments from 2018 to 2025, providing a practical guide and detailed overview of modern Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architec- tures. RAG offers a modular approach for integrating external knowl- edge without increasing the capacity of the model as LLM systems ex- pand. Research and engineering practices have been fragmented as a result of the increasing diversity of RAG methodologies, which encom- passes a variety of fusion mechanisms, retrieval strategies, and orches- tration approaches. We provide quantitative assessment frameworks, analyze the implications for trust and alignment, and systematically consolidate existing RAG techniques into a unified taxonomy. This document is a practical framework for the deployment of resilient, se- cure, and domain-adaptable RAG systems, synthesizing insights from academic literature, industry reports, and technical implementation guides. It also functions as a technical reference. 1 arXiv:2601.05264v1 [cs.IR] 7 Nov 2025 Keywords:Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Large Language Models, Information Retrieval, Neural Language Models, Knowledge- Augmented Generation, AI System Architectures, Trustworthy AI, Model Alignment, Multi-agent Systems. 1 Introduction: Why Architecture Matters in RAG 1.1 Motivation and Systematic Review Foundation In the swiftly evolving field of natural language processing (NLP), the con- straints of monolithic large language models (LLMs) have become increas- ingly apparent. These models are restricted by intrinsic constraints in memory, temporal alignment, and factual precision, despite their remark- able generative capacity [1][2]. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a transformative approach that addresses these challenges by distinguish- ing
