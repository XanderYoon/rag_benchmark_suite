RAG architectures continuously surpass single-method approaches by integrating BM25's lexical accuracy with dense vector seman- tics [64], [65]. Hybrid methodologies mitigate complementary deficiencies: sparse methods excel in precise keyword matching, whilst dense methods effectively capture semantic similarity. 5.4.1 BGE-M3 and Unified Retrieval Models BGE-M3 is a premier unified model that enables the retrieval of dense, sparse, and multi-vector data across over 100 languages, with a maximum of 8192 tokens [66]. The model architecture integrates three retrieval paradigms: dense retrieval for semantic matching, sparse retrieval for exact term matching, and multi-vector retrieval for fine-grained representation. 5.4.2 Reciprocal Rank Fusion and Result Combination Reciprocal Rank Fusion with k=60 has become the industry standard for result combination, necessitating minimal parameter tuning while operating effectively across various score scales and distributions [67]. Platform imple- mentations exhibit performance variations depending on system architecture and optimization [68]. 5.5 Graph-Augmented and Structured RAG: Relationship- Aware Retrieval Graph-Augmented and Structured RAG architectures demonstrate substan- tial improvements compared to conventional vector-based systems, making them particularly effective in domain-specific applications that require a 23 deep understanding of relationships and complex multi-hop reasoning [69], [70]. Case studies on knowledge-graph-grounded retrieval report consistent gains on multi-hop questions via relation-aware context construction [84]. 5.5.1 Neo4j as a Foundation for Graph-Augmented RAG Neo4j, a prominent native graph database, is a critical infrastructure com- ponent for GraphRAG systems that are both scalable and query-efficient. It is particularly well-suited for the management of complex LLM-generated knowledge graphs due to its support for property graph structures, Cypher- based querying, and hierarchical traversal. Neo4j facilitates semantic subgraph extraction, multi-hop reasoning through efficient path queries, community-level summarization through clustering algorithms, and seam- less integration with domain-specific ontologies, such as UMLS or legal taxonomies, in GraphRAG pipelines. Neo4j is employed by production- level implementations such as Microsoft GraphRAG and MedGraphRAG
