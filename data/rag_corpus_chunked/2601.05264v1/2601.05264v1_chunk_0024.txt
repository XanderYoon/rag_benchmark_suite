agents to enhance the overall performance of the system [75]. LangChain/LangGraph offers graph-based workflow management [76], CrewAI provides role-based agent specialization [77], and OpenAI Swarm concentrates on lightweight multi-agent orchestration [78]. Additionally, industry adoption is expedited by comprehensive frameworks. 5.7 Comparative Analysis and Performance Benchmarks RAG architectures exhibit significant differences regarding accuracy, scal- ability, and domain suitability, accompanied by trade-offs between opera- tional complexity and implementation requirements. Graph-Augmented and Agentic RAG models demonstrate substantial enhancements in accuracy; however, they require additional computational resources. Hybrid Sparse- Dense methodologies provide a more economical and scalable option.
