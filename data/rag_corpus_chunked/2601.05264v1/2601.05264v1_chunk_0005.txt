Methodology 2.1 Review Protocol and Scope This comprehensive survey implements a systematic literature review (SLR) methodology that is consistent with the well-established standards for soft- ware engineering research [3] and extends them to the AI/ML areas. The 5 review protocol was developed to guarantee comprehensive coverage, reduce bias, and generate reproducible results for the constantly changing RAG field. While confronting the distinctive challenges of surveying rapidly developing AI/ML research domains, the systematic approach adheres to established academic standards for literature synthesis. Throughout the review pro- cess, our methodology prioritizes methodological rigor, reproducibility, and transparency. 2.2 Research Questions and Search Strategy The systematic literature review was directed by critical research questions that encompassed RAG architectural patterns, performance characteristics, implementation challenges, and deployment considerations. In order to guarantee thorough coverage of the RAG domain, the search strategy in- cluded academic databases, industry sources, and technical documentation. Primary Research Questions: •What are the fundamental architectural patterns in contemporary RAG systems? •How do different RAG designs address scalability, accuracy, and de- ployment requirements? •What are the key trade-offs between architectural complexity and sys- tem performance? •How do trust calibration and safety mechanisms integrate with RAG architectures? •What trends characterize the evolution from canonical to agentic RAG systems? Search Strategy:Systematic queries were implemented across numerous databases, including IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, arXiv, Google Scholar, and industry technical repositories. The search terms included retrieval-augmented generation, dense passage retrieval, neural information retrieval, and related architectural terminology. 2.3 Selection Criteria and Quality Assessment Inclusion Criteria 6 In order to guarantee quality and relevance, the review implemented sys- tematic inclusion criteria: •Publications that concentrate predominantly on RAG systems, archi- tectures, or implementations •Quantitative evaluation components in empirical studies •Technical implementation details are included in architectural propos- als. •Case studies and production deployment scenarios •Technical documentation from well-established AI/ML
