stacks [89]–[90]. 2 Secondly, modularity facilitates plug-and-play compatibility among compo- nents, thereby enabling precise optimization and domain-specific customiza- tion across the retriever, reranker, and generator stages [8]. Enterprise de- ployments have shown that modular RAG architectures significantly reduce technology refresh expenses and facilitate the quicker integration of new features in comparison to monolithic methodologies [9]. Third, citation traceability improves interpretability and credibility by as- sociating generated outputs with specific evidence passages, which is con- sistent with the increasing emphasis on accountability and explainability in AI systems [10][11]. In comparison to systems that lack attribution func- tionalities, enterprise implementations that integrate comprehensive citation frameworks report enhanced user trust ratings and decreased support esca- lations [12]. In contexts where empirical accuracy, timeliness, and transparency are es- sential, such as legal analytics, biomedical inquiry resolution, and regulatory compliance tools, these advantages are especially apparent [13][14]. The sys- tematic review revealed a substantial body of literature that addressed trust and safety concerns, highlighting the critical significance of reliable, account- able information systems and constituting a substantial portion of current research.
