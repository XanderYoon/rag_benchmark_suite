In addition to safeguarding consumers, organi- zations are also protected from legal and reputational risks by adhering to frameworks such as GDPR, CCPA, and SOC 2 [155]. Technical Defense Mechanisms The security and trustworthiness of the RAG system can be improved through the implementation of numerous technical strategies [156]. The TrustRAG framework exhibits substantial enhancements in system reli- ability by employing a two-stage defense mechanism that incorporates self-assessment and K-means clustering [157][158].
