A complex ecosystem with limited standardization has been established as a result of the proliferation of diverse retrieval mechanisms (dense, sparse, hybrid), fusion strategies (early, late, marginal), and orchestration layers (static pipelines vs. agentic controllers) [28][29]. This fragmentation is evident in multiple essential domains: Evaluation Inconsistency: The analysis of evaluation methodologies in- dicates that standardized benchmarks are underutilized, while custom eval- uation criteria are predominant, which restricts cross-study comparability [30]. This lack of standardization obstructs systematic progress and presents obstacles for practitioners in the selection of architecture. Implementation Diversity: A multitude of distinctive implementation patterns are revealed in enterprise case studies, despite the fact that there is minimal knowledge sharing between organizations. This redundancy leads to the industry's repeated discovery of prevalent pitfalls and suboptimal resource allocation [31]. Trust Framework Gaps: Trust and safety considerations are the subject of a significant amount of literature; however, exhaustive frameworks are scarce, and quantitative evaluations of trust mechanisms are even more un- common [32]. This discrepancy is especially alarming in light of the mission- critical nature of numerous RAG deployments. 4 1.4 Article Contributions and Research Foundation By conducting a comprehensive, technically rigorous, and critical assessment of the field, this survey endeavors to unify the fragmented landscape of RAG architectures. The primary contributions, which are derived from an exhaustive systematic literature review, are as follows: A Comprehensive Architectural Taxonomy: We present a systematic categorization
