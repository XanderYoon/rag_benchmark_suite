Figure 3.2: Canonical vs. Agentic RAG Pipelines. 13 3.7 Performance Factors and Optimization Modern RAG implementations must maintain a delicate equilibrium among various performance metrics, such as computational efficiency, latency, and accuracy. The canonical architecture establishes a strong foundation while simultaneously emphasizing specific optimization opportunities: Retrieval optimizationconcentrates on the efficacy of similarity compu- tation and index structure. Dense vector approaches facilitate rapid approx- imate nearest neighbor searches; however, they may compromise precision for specialized queries that necessitate precise lexical matching. Generation optimizationentails the selection of the appropriate model sizeandtheaccelerationofinference. Incomparisontolargegeneral-purpose generators, smaller, domain-adapted models frequently offer adequate qual- ity with reduced latency. Pipeline coordinationpresents the potential for parallelization and caching strategies to reduce the overall system latency while ensuring the quality of the response. 3.8 Design Trade-offs and Implications A foundational architecture that integrates sequence-to-sequence generation with dense passage retrieval is provided by the canonical RAG pipeline as established by Lewis et al. [1]. While introducing its own architectural constraints and trade-offs, this approach effectively addresses the primary limitations of parametric-only language models. The field's evolution toward greater flexibility and capability is reflected in theprogressionfromcanonicaltomoresophisticatedRAGvariants. Eachar- chitectural decision necessitates the negotiation of computational efficiency, accuracy requirements, and system complexity in relation to the specific requirements of the application. Informed architectural decisions can be made when designing RAG sys- tems for specific domains and use cases by comprehending these fundamen- tal trade-offs. The canonical architecture continues to be pertinent as a foundation and building block for more sophisticated implementations that overcome its inherent limitations by utilizing specialized components and adaptive mechanisms. 14 4 Taxonomy of RAG Architectures The rapid proliferation of contemporary Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems has prompted the necessity of a systematic
