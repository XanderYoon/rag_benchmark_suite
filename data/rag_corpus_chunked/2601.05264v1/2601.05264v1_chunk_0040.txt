outdated or ab- sent knowledge, and biases in structural curation, as illustrated in Figure 9.1. The Retriever layer may be susceptible to hostile queries that exploit ranking algorithms or exacerbate source bias. The Generator is suscepti- ble to hallucinations, particularly when presented with token truncation or nonsensical input, despite the benefits of enhanced context. In the final analysis, the Citation Layer introduces risks related to provenance distor- tion, in which responses that are purportedly credible may be incorrectly associated with unverifiable or malevolent sources.

The complex interactions between retrieval mechanisms, knowledge base curation, information synthesis, and generation processes are the source of these challenges [146]. 44 Taxonomy of Reasoning Misalignment RAG systems are susceptible to reasoning misalignment, which occurs when the model's reasoning tra- jectory deviates from the evidential constraints established by retrieval [147]. This phenomenon can be systematically decomposed into three interdependent phases: relevance assessment, query-evidence mapping, and evidence-integrated synthesis [147]. Table 9.1: RAG Reasoning Misalignment Phases Phase Description Common Failures Impact Level Relevance Assessment Failure to prioritize semantically relevant evidence Off-topic document selection Medium Query-Evidence Mapping Misalignment in connecting queries to evidence Weak causal connections High Evidence- Integrated Synthesis Logical inconsistencies in combining evidence Contradictory conclusions Critical Trust Vulnerability Matrix RAG systems generate numerous trust surfaces that may be compromised by a variety of attack vectors [148]. The vulnerability landscape encom- passes four critical layers: citation attribution accuracy, generation fidelity, retrieval mechanism security, and knowledge base integrity [149].
