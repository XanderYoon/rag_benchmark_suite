competitive performance on the 2019 and 2021 LA datasets. The consistent im- provements achieved on multiple datasets highlight the potential of RAD as a new paradigm for DF detection. The ablation study re- veals RAD and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) share similar properties in improving detection performance. Additionally, the retrieved samples are usually from the same speaker, suggesting potential interpretability. In conclusion, this work opens promising research avenues into retrieval-based augmentation techniques to enhance performance for detection tasks. By breaking the reliance on a single model, RAD provides a new perspective that utilizes more available information to overcome performance limitations and advance DF detection techniques.
