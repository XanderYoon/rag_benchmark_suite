to DF detection, we extend the Multi-Fusion Attentive (MFA) classifier [9], named RAD-MFA, which combines the raw query input for detection and the retrieved similar bonafide samples to make comprehensive analysis for detections. Specifically, Figure 5 illustrates the overall structure of our proposed detection model, and Figure 5 shows the MFA sub-modules in detail. MFA Module. The MFA Module in our framework handles the test feature ˜𝑦𝑞 and the retrieved features  ˜𝑦𝑘,𝑙 . For conciseness, these features are denoted by 𝑦 in Figure 5. Specifically, the MFA module is implemented through the following steps: Figure 5: The structure of detection model architecture. ⊕ denotes the concatenation. This process illustrates the 3rd get results stage of Figure 3-RAD in detail. (1) The input feature 𝑦 ∈ R𝐵×𝐿×𝑇 ×𝐹 is passed through 𝐿 parallel time-wise attentive statistic pooling (ASP) layers (denoted as ASP𝑇 (·)) to eliminate the time dimension. Here, 𝐵 denotes a virtual dimension. (2) The last outputs are concatenated and passed through a fully connected layer to transform the features to R𝐵×𝐿×2𝐹 . (3) These outputs are then passed through a layer-wise ASP layer (denoted as ASP𝐿 (·)) to form the intermediate representation 𝑟 ∈ R𝐵×4𝐹 . Extended RAD-based MFA. The RAD-MFA is implemented through the following steps: (1) The test feature ˜𝑦𝑞 ∈ R1×𝐿×𝑇 ×𝐹 and the retrieved features ˜𝑦𝑘,𝑙 ∈ R𝐾 ×𝐿×𝑇 ×𝐹 are sent to the same MFA module, creat- ing intermediate representations 𝑟𝑞 ∈ R1×4𝐹 and 𝑟𝑘 ∈ R1×4𝐹 respectively. (2) These two representations are used to form 𝑟𝑑 ∈ R1×4𝐹 by taking their difference, 𝑟𝑑 = 𝑟𝑘 − 𝑟𝑞. We make a difference between two features with extremely similar timbre, which allows the discriminative model to pay more attention to other differential information, such as background noise. (3) This output is sent to a
