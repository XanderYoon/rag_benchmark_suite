For training, the entire pipeline operates on the pre-computed features rather than raw audio, with the cached test features, retrieved database features, and corresponding labels, making the training process extremely fast. For testing, this design allows efficient retrieval of audio contents without repetitively invoking the computationally expensive WavLM feature extraction each time. Time-wise Speedup. The acoustic features extracted by WavLM have a frame-to-frame hop size of 20 ms and a large number of layers, resulting in an extremely large number of generated feature parameters that require a large amount of storage space. To solve the problem, we propose a method S (·) to simplify features in the time dimension. Let 𝑥 denote an audio segment sample, the feature extracted by WavLM is called latent long features 𝑦′ ∈ R𝑇 ′ ×𝐹 , which can then be transformed into short features 𝑦 ∈ R𝑇 ×𝐹 by the S. A speedup parameter 𝜏 is introduced, which partitions the long feature 𝑦′ along the time dimension as: partition 𝑦′ =  𝑦′ 1, ..., 𝑦′ 𝜏  ,  𝑦′ 𝜏+1, ..., 𝑦′ 2𝜏  , ...,  ..., 𝑦′ 𝑇 ′  | {z } 𝑇 ′/𝜏 partitions . (2) The speedup short feature 𝑦𝑡 can then be derived by taking the average along the partitioned time dimension as: 𝑦 = S 𝑦′ =  mean  ..., 𝑦′ 𝜏  , ..., mean  ..., 𝑦′ 𝑇 ′  . (3) Applying this speedup technique enables significant savings in storage space. However, there is an additional question that needs to be experimentally verified: • Question 4: Does time-wise speedup method affect down- stream DF detection performance? This question is validated in § 4.4. 4 EXPERIMENTS The following section describes the datasets and assessment metrics (described in § 4.1) used for all
