procedural modifications compared to RAG. (1) Build Knowledge Retrieval Database. As shown in the stage 1 (blue section) of Figure 3-RAD, the bonafide audio dataset 𝑥 ′ is segmented into smaller audio segments {𝑥𝑛 } at the 𝑛th sample. These audio segments can be encoded to latent long feature repre- sentations n 𝑦′ 𝑛,𝑙 o ∈ R𝑁 ×𝐿×𝑇 ′ ×𝐹 by WavLM feature extractor E (·), where 𝑇 ′ is the time dimension of long features,𝑁 is the number of audio segments, and 𝑙 indexes the encoder layer of WavLM. Subse- quently, two operations are performed on the long features n 𝑦′ 𝑛,𝑙 o : (a) The features are embedded into dense vector representations 𝑣𝑛,𝑙 ∈ R𝑁 ×𝐿×𝐹 via the mapping M (·) in Equation 1, where each 𝑣𝑛,𝑙 summarizes the time-wise features 𝑦′ 𝑛,𝑙 by temporal averag- ing to eliminate the time dimension 𝑇 ′; (b) The time dimension is shortened to form short feature  𝑦𝑛,𝑙 ∈ R𝑁 ×𝐿×𝑇 ×𝐹 for improved efficiency by the functionS (·) (details in § 3.4), where𝑇 is the time dimension of short feature. 𝑣𝑛,𝑙 = M  𝑦′ 𝑛,𝑙  = 1 𝑇 𝑇∑︁ 𝑡 =1 𝑦′ 𝑛,𝑙 𝑡 . (1) Importantly, each embedding 𝑣𝑛,𝑙 maintains an index linking to its original short feature 𝑦𝑛,𝑙, enabling the retrieval of the original audio segment 𝑥𝑛 for the source content. Finally, the collection of embeddings  𝑣𝑛,𝑙 are stored in 𝑙 vector databases V𝑙 to enable efficient similarity search and retrieval. (2) Retrieve Knowledge. As shown in the stage 2 (red section) of Figure 3-RAD, a sample to be detected ˜𝑥𝑞 can be embedded into a query embedding ˜𝑣𝑞,𝑙 ∈ R𝐿×𝐹 by function E, M, and can be con- verted to short features ˜𝑦𝑞,𝑙 ∈ R𝐿×𝑇 ×𝐹 by function E, S.
