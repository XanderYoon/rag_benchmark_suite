bonafide samples will be used to build the retrieval database. This experimental design aims to evaluate the generalization ability of the DF detection system against unknown spoofing at- tacks. Furthermore, the dataset may not contain complete bonafide recordings of all speakers that were impersonated in the spoof- ing dataset. The lack of target speaker data may limit the ability of the DF detection system to perform accurate speaker charac- teristics comparisons. To mitigate this issue, additional bonafide samples from impersonated speakers should be found to augment the available knowledge database for the retrieval system. ASVspoof 2021 LA Database. The LA and DF evaluation subsets from the ASVspoof 2021 [27] challenge present intentionally more difficult spoofing detection tasks compared to the 2019 LA data, including more unseen attacks, and both encoding and transmis- sion distortions in the LA set, as well as the unseen coding and compression artifacts in the DF set. According to the challenge guidelines, since no new training or development data was released for the ASVspoof 2021 challenge, model training, and evaluation were limited only to the ASVspoof 2019 database. The entire subset of ASVspoof 2021 LA and DF were used for model testing. VCTK Database. All bonafide samples of ASVSpoof are a very small subset of the VCTK dataset. To mitigate the issue of insufficient bonafide samples per speaker, as the datasets used originate from the VCTK dataset, we expand our database by using additional sam- ples that exclude all samples already present in our experimental data. This allows us to increase the number of bonafide samples available for each speaker in the retrieval task. Metrics. We evaluated our proposed model on these datasets using two standard metrics: the minimum normalized tandem detection cost function (min t-DCF) [14] and pooled equal error rate (EER). The min t-DCF
