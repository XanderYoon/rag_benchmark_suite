first con- verts the raw speech signal𝑥 into a speech features𝑦. These speech features are then passed to the back-end classifier, which analyzes the speech features that make a bonafide vs. spoof decision 𝑧. Such architectures leverage the capabilities of efficient hand-crafted fea- tures or semantically rich self-supervised pre-trained features to obtain highly informative speech representations. The back-end classifier then fully analyzes and mines these features, and makes the final prediction. (2) End-to-End Framework. More advanced frameworks transform the feature extraction into a trainable encoder, forming an end- to-end architecture (Figure 1-2). Differently, instead of the feature extractor, the raw speech 𝑥 is fed into a trainable encoder to pro- duce speech representations 𝑦. To further improve performance, some approaches fuse multiple feature extractors or encoders, con- catenating the resulting speech features and representations for deeper training. 2.2 Retrieval Augmented Generation Prior to introducing our proposed approach, it is instructive to first provide background knowledge on the retrieval augmented generation (RAG) framework [15] to facilitate comparison with our method. The RAG framework consists of three main stages: Retrieval-Augmented Audio Deepfake Detection ICMR ’24, June 10–14, 2024, Phuket, Thailand Figure 1: The overview of traditional frameworks, and our proposed framework for audio deepfake detection.

As shown in the stage 1 (blue section) of Figure 3-RAG, the plain text and format-rich text database 𝑥 is partitioned into smaller chunks {𝑥𝑛 } at 𝑛th sample. These text chunks are then embedded into dense vector represen- tations {𝑣𝑛 } by a language model. In addition, each embedding 𝑣𝑛 maintains an index that links it to its original text chunk 𝑥𝑛, allowing the retrieval of the original text content. Finally,
