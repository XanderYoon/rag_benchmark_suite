Figure 5) to the classifier slightly increases the pooled EER to 2.49%, suggesting that not only the difference of the feature, but also the original feature play the role for performance improvement. Effect of Time-wise Speedup Parameter. Table 4 examines whether time-wise speedup affects the performance of DF detection. We tested the original and the fine-tuned WavLM-Large feature ex- tractor on the ASVspoof 2021 DF with 𝜏 is 5, 10, 20, reporting by the pooled EER. It is difficult to test under 𝜏 < 5 due to very high computational costs and storage consumption, which need to be ad- dressed in future work. Before fine-tuning, the performance varies greatly across 𝜏: the smaller 𝜏 is, the better the performance, but the much higher computational cost and storage consumption. Af- ter fine-tuning, the gap narrows, suggesting that optimization can reduce the impact of time-wise speedup operation. Overall, the time-wise speedup operation will affect the performance, but not too much, which answers the research Question 4. Taking these factors into account, we finally chose 𝜏 = 10. However, we still need better ways to reduce storage and computation, which is an open problem that needs to be investigated. 4.5 Sample Analysis The retrieval samples shown in Figure 6 with clickable audio to hear, offer insights into the factors influencing successful detection of spoofing artifacts. This figure presents 4 test samples, comprising 3 spoofed and 1 bonafide audio, along with the 2 to 3 most similar samples. Extracts were taken from three layers (initial, middle, final) of a WavLM-L model. Despite quality defects in the spoofed test samples, the system appeared to retrieve samples from the same speaker identities. This suggests the system might rely strongly on speaker-discriminative features, potentially providing an ap- proximate answer to the research Question 3. However, although Figure
