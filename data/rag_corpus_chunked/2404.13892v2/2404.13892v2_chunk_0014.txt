required for each generated or detection task, and external data sources require regular maintenance. These require additional computational resources. Data retrieval process leads to higher latency. The labels are fixed, credible, and free of ethical and privacy concerns. Figure 4: Properties of RAG, RAD, and full training/fine- tuning for detection.

Importantly, this detection model not only evaluates relevant samples, but also provides detailed comparisons with the most similar real samples. This additional contextual information helps to make more accurate judgments for DF detections. Properties similar to RAG in RAD. Despite their different applica- tions, with RAD optimized for detection and RAG for generation, given the similarities in structure and algorithms between RAG and RAD, it is likely that RAD also has the same advantages as RAG. Figure 4 provides a detailed summary of the key advantages and disadvantages of RAG, RAD, and full training / fine-tuning approaches. Although similarities and differences exist across these methods, three critical questions emerge as follows: • Question 1: Does the RAD framework reduce detection errors? • Question 2: Does updating external knowledge for the RAD framework further improve detection performance? • Question 3: Can the retrieved audio samples be interpreted? Research questions 1, 2 are verified in § 4.4, and question 3 is verified in § 4.5. 3.3 Detection Model To apply RAD to DF detection, we extend the Multi-Fusion Attentive (MFA) classifier [9], named RAD-MFA, which combines the raw query input for detection and the retrieved similar bonafide samples to make comprehensive analysis for detections. Specifically, Figure 5 illustrates the overall structure of our proposed detection model, and Figure 5 shows the MFA sub-modules in detail. MFA Module. The MFA Module in
