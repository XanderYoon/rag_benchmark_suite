The ablation study pre- sented in Table 3 summarizes the results obtained by evaluating different configurations and components of the proposed system on the ASVspoof 2021 DF subset. Specifically, the impact of the RAD framework, WavLM-L feature extractor, fine-tuning of the feature extractor, incorporation of additional VCTK datasets for data retrieval, and the structure of the detection network were ana- lyzed. The experiments were conducted using a time-wise speedup parameter 𝜏 = 10. System performance was assessed using the pooled EER expressed as a percentage. The key observations are summarized as follows (line-by-line explanation from Table 3): (1) The full system reaches the SOTA performance with a pooled EER of 2.38%. (2) Removing the proposed RAD framework for similar sample retrieval increases the pooled EER to 2.90%. This validates the effectiveness of the RAD framework, which answers the re- search Question 1. However, this result is slightly higher than that of Guo et al. [9], which may be due to different parameter settings and time-wise
