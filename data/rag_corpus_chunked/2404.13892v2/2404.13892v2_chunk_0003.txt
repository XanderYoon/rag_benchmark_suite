frame- works for detecting DF audio. The predominant frameworks utilize a pipeline consisting of a front-end feature extractor and a back-end classifier (discussed in § 2.1). Early works relied on hand-crafted features for DF detection with some success, such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) [10], linear-frequency cepstral coef- ficients (LFCC) [5, 17, 24], CQT [16, 32], and F0 sub-band feature [7]. However, these features exhibit limited performance due to the limited dataset used to train the robust model. More recent SOTA frameworks have leveraged the capabilities of self-supervised model feature extractors, such as wav2vec [1, 2, 18, 21, 25] and WavLM [2, 4, 9]. Moreover, Kawa et al. [13] utilize another powerful task- specific feature in deepfake detection using the pre-trained Whisper model [19]. Theoretically, by training on a large number of labeled or unlabeled bonafide samples in very large datasets, these feature extractor models could be particularly sensitive to unseen DF arti- facts. Some alternative frameworks replace hand-crafted features with end-to-end trainable encoders. Notable examples include Jung et al. ’s advanced graph attention network architecture AASIST [26], and Huang et al. ’s discriminative frequency-based improvements to SincNet [12], both of which achieve competitive performance. As discussed by Sun et al. [20], vocoders employed in regular speech synthesis can introduce inconsistencies that reveal DFs. However, regardless of the methodology and architecture used, these frame- works rely solely on a single model to accomplish this challenging task, which may prove inadequate. DF detection should be a knowledge-intensive task that also relies on vast external knowledge. To explain this, let’s start with a story. In the identification of antique artifacts, fakes are often fabricated so realistically that it is difficult to determine their au- thenticity. Senior experts usually conduct a meticulous comparative analysis that includes material and textural attributes of many simi-
