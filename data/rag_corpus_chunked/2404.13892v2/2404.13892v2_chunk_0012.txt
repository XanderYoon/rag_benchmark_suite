to enable efficient similarity search and retrieval. (2) Retrieve Knowledge. As shown in the stage 2 (red section) of Figure 3-RAD, a sample to be detected ˜𝑥𝑞 can be embedded into a query embedding ˜𝑣𝑞,𝑙 ∈ R𝐿×𝐹 by function E, M, and can be con- verted to short features ˜𝑦𝑞,𝑙 ∈ R𝐿×𝑇 ×𝐹 by function E, S. This query embedding ˜𝑣𝑞,𝑙 is then utilized to perform a similarity search across vector databases – for each layer 𝑙, there is a corresponding vector database V𝑙 to be searched. The top 𝐾 most similar embeddings ˜𝑣𝑘,𝑙 ∈ R𝐾 ×𝐿×𝐹 are retrieved, along with their associated short features  ˜𝑦𝑘,𝑙 ∈ R𝐾 ×𝐿×𝑇 ×𝐹 . These 𝐾 most relevant audio sam- ples serve as references for detailed comparison with the sample to be detected. By analyzing the similarities and differences, the authenticity of the tested samples can be better determined. (3) Get Results (Sample Detection). As shown in stage 3 (green sec- tion) of Figure 3-RAD, our proposed RAD framework requires the training of an additional detection model. This model accepts the samples to be tested as well as the most relevant retrieved samples. Specifically, the detection model is provided with the query short features ˜𝑦𝑞,𝑙 and the top 𝐾 similar short features  ˜𝑦𝑘,𝑙 to make the Retrieval-Augmented Audio Deepfake Detection ICMR ’24, June 10–14, 2024, Phuket, Thailand Comparison RAG RAD Full training / fine tuning for detection Knowledge Updates Updates directly to the latest retrieved knowledge base, without the need for frequent re- training to obtain the latest knowledge.
