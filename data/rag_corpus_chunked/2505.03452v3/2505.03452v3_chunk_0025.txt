Next, improve efficiency by using a greedy HPO algorithm that optimizes model choices first, that will provide faster convergence. For large datasets, combine that algorithm with development set sampling to efficiently find a top-performing RAG configuration. Finally, we open-source our complete grid search results over the development and test sets for all datasets. 17 To our knowledge, we are the first to release such a resource for RAG. Building on these results, further research can explore new HPO techniques without incurring the substantial cost of running many RAG configuration across datasets. Our re- lease also includes the generation outputs for each configu- ration, enabling easy computation of additional metrics and their analysis in the context of HPO. We hope this release will serve as a valuable contribution to research on HPO for RAG. References Adlakha, V .; BehnamGhader, P.; Lu, X. H.; Meade, N.; and Reddy, S. 2024.
