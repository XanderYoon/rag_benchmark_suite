base- line grid search results for both the development and test sets, over the full search space. 2 These are crucial for es- tablishing upper bounds on HPO performance for RAG, and understanding its generalization capability. While the inclusion of grid search enables a comparison to the best possible result, it poses computational constraints on the size of the explored search space. Nonetheless, our search space is the largest considered for RAG HPO to date while still including a comparison to full grid search. The search space comprises of162RAG configurations derived from five core RAG parameters (see Figure 1): chunk size and overlap, which control how documents are split, the embedding model used to encode chunks in a vector database, the number of retrieved chunks included as context when answering a question, and the generative model that produces the answer. Exploring an expanded search space introduced by more complex RAG pipelines, such as agentic workflows, poses significant computational challenges for exhaustive grid search. Consequently, this as- pect is deferred to future work. Our evaluation addresses multiple aspects of HPO for RAG, including the convergence properties of the algo- rithms, the impact of the objective metric on the best con- figuration, and an analysis of HPO overall cost. We also ex- plore reducing that cost through development set sampling. In summary, our main contributions are as follows: (i) comprehensive benchmarking of RAG HPO in a realistic generalization setup, over the largest search space with full grid-search evaluations to-date, showing that RAG HPO can be done efficiently, either greedily or with simple random search, and that it significantly boosts RAG performance for all datasets; (ii) a detailed analysis of the results, explor- ing the connections between the optimized parameters, the dataset and the optimization objective. For greedy HPO ap- proaches, we show
