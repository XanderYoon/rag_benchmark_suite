on two parameters: thesizeof each chunk in tokens, and theoverlapbetween consecutive chunks. This is followed by representing each chunk with a dense vec- tor created by anembeddingmodel – our third parame- ter. The vectors are stored in a vector-database, 6 alongside their original text. Upon receiving a query, the topkrelevant chunks are retrieved (retrieval);kbeing our fourth param- eter. Lastly, a prompt containing the query and the retrieved chunks is passed to agenerative model(our fifth parame- ter) to create an answer (generation). Greedy decoding was used throughout all experiments. The prompts were fixed to RAG prompts tailored to each model.7 The specific values considered for each of the five hyper- parameters are described in Table 1. In total, the search space has3∗2∗3∗3∗3 = 162possibleRAG configurations.
