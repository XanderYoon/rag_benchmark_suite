Model, Chunk Size, Chunk Overlap, Top-K.Retrieval- first(Greedy-R) is a prevalent option following the RAG pipeline structure, starting with retrieval optimization (still with model first), then generation: Embedding Model, Chunk Size, Chunk Overlap, Generative Model and Top- K.Retrieval-first with context correctness(Greedy-R-CC) uses the same order, yet optimizes the retrieval-related pa- rameters with a context correctness metric evaluated solely on the retrieval results, saving the costs of LLM inference until all retrieval parameters are chosen. Remaining param- eters are then optimized with answer correctness. Setup Our experimental design reflects a realistic use case: an HPO algorithm is executed over a benchmark (a development set) and the best RAG configuration is chosen for deployment; the deployed configuration is expected to generalize to un- seen questions – simulated here via a test set. Specifically, each HPO algorithm ran on each development set for10it- erations. After every iteration, the best configuration on the development set was evaluated on the test set, enabling a per-iteration generalization analysis. Since all algorithms in- volve a random element, each run was repeated with10dif- ferent random seeds.
