this might involve removing half - spaces. This stage is crucial, as the quality of input data has a direct impact on final results. D. Embedder The embedder plays a key role in converting texts into vector representations. This process involves using deep learning models to compress textual information into numerical vectors. These vectors, although more compact and with fewer dimensions, preserve the semantic information of the texts and convert them into an efficient vector representation for further processing. E. Vector Database Once the texts have been converted to vectors, they are stored in a vector database. This database is optimized to facilitate fast and efficient retrieval of similar vectors. Using a vector database allows the system to perform rapid searches based on textual vectors. One of the leading vector databases, which was also used in this research, is Elasticsearch. F. User Query This section relates to the user's input. The user presents a query or request to the system, which could be a simple or complex text that requires processing by the language model. G. Embedder (For user query) As in the previous stage, the user's query is also transformed into a numerical vector by an embedder. This vector represents the semantic meaning of the user’s query and is used to compare it with the stored vectors in the Vector Database. H. Retriever The retriever compares the user’s query vector with the vectors stored in the vector database to find the sections of the knowledge base that have the highest semantic similarity to the query. This optimized retrieval process allows the system to pass precise information to subsequent stages. I. Related Chunks This section collects texts identified by the retriever as relevant and feeds them into the system as the next input. These are key parts of information directly
