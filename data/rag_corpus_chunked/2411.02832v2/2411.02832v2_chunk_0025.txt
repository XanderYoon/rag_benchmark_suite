pairs of questions and answers. The structure of this dataset includes columns for the question, answer, related paragraph, question type (factoid from a table or plain text), and the document name. Designed to evaluate the RAG system's performance when dealing with university regulations in Persian, this dataset enables a more focused assessment of factoid questions. The responses generated by the system are added to a separate column in this dataset and are evaluated. TABLE V.

This approach not only contributes to improving the quality of responses but also paves the way for future developments in the field of Persian natural language processing and intelligent question - answering systems. VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have identified and addressed the key challenges faced when applying RAG in low -resource contexts. As a potential case study, we concentrated in developing a practical RAG system for Persian Language. Through our analysis, we proposed tar geted solutions for addressing several issues containing table embedding, PDF files reading, chunking optimization, embedding model selection, retrieved chunks formatting, prompt engineering, questions answering in the target language, LLM selection, precise evaluation framework and datasets, hyperparameters optimization and, hallucination reduction. Our experimental results show that the proposed solutions can significantly enhance RAG performance, making it a viable option for low -resource settings. These findings contribute to the broader adoption of retrieval -augmented models in areas with limited access to large
