its dialects, and the scarcity of datasets [16, 17]. Ultimately, the goal of this paper was to evaluate the effectiveness of semantic search in Arabic language processing alongside its impact on the performance of RAG systems specifically designed for Arabic question - answering use cases. Other research has also been conducted on the effects of different components of RAG systems. For instance, the article by Yuanjie Liu et al. [18] introduces a comprehensive Chinese benchmark for RAG in large language models . This paper addresses the challenge of evaluating RAG systems by highlighting that most benchmarks primarily focus on question-answering applications and tend to overlook other potential scenarios where RAG could be beneficial. To overcome this limitation, they develop a large-scale and more comprehensive benchmark that evaluates all components of RAG systems across various RAG application scenarios. Specifically, the paper describes the interactions between users and knowledge bases in a RAG system in terms of CRUD actions and categorizes RAG applications into four distinct types: Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD). The 'Create' category refers t o scenarios requiring the generation of original and diverse content. 'Read' involves answering complex questions in knowledge-intensive situations. 'Update' focuses on revising and correcting inaccuracies or inconsistencies in existing texts. Lastly, 'Delete' pertains to the task of summarizing extensive texts into more concise forms. For each of these CRUD categories, the study has created and utilized different datasets to evaluate the performance of RAG systems. Additionally, the effects of various RAG system components such as the retriever, context length, knowledge base construction, and the LLM have been analyzed. Ultimately, this research provides valuable insights for optimizing RAG technology for different scenarios, offering a comprehensive evaluation framework that contributes to the advancement of RAG systems. However, this is not the only work conducted in the
