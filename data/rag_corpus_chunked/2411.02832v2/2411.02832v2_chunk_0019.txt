to separate different parts of the text, rows and columns in tables, and optimizing table styles, according to our team's investigations, results in receiving more accurate and better responses from LLMs. • Adding Metadata: An effective strategy to improve the performance of RAG systems is to include brief contextual information before each retrieved result. This approach helps LLMs better comprehend the relationship between the retrieved results and the user's query, leading to more accurate responses. In real operational environ ments, which encompass a vast array of diverse documents such as sales reports and meeting minutes, adding metadata can significantly prevent semantic errors. For instance, in response to a query like "Sales report of the section under discussion following the June meeting" , without metadata, the retrieval module might return all results related to June without considering the relevant year. This could result in the LLM generating irrelevant and misleading answers. To resolve this issue, appropriate metadata, such as precise temporal information (e.g., datetime), can be added to the user's query, substantially increasing the accuracy and correctness of the responses. This approach assists both the LLM and the retrieval module in understanding the user's exact intent when referencing a specific time frame. It is important to note that the type and number of required metadata should be adjusted according to the application domain and the general pattern of expected queries in the RAG system. In some cases, merely adding temporal information may not suffice, and it may be necessary to incorporate additional contextual information. To optimize this process, another LLM chain can be employed at the beginning of the pipeline to intelligently identify and add the necessary types and am ounts of metadata. In conclusion, by implementing the aforementioned set of strategies and conducting continuous optimizations, we were able to significantly
