der the comprehension of text by large language models, and the more non -standard or problematic data there is, the lower the accuracy of the entire pipeline. Additionally, some organizations or companies maintain their PDFs as scanned copies with no access to the original Text version. For these types of files, advanced image-to-text conversion models and various (Optical Character Recognition) OCR tools were tested. Initial experiments indicated that the best method for extracting text from these files is through OCR. In this regard, open-source multilingual OCR tools with Persian recognition capabilities that operate offline were evaluated. The tools tested included Tesseract OCR, ABBYY FineReader, py2pdf, and Easy OCR. The results showed that the best tool for offline OCR is Google's Tesseract OCR. Although Tesseract performs better in recognizing Persian text compared to similar tools, it still faces challenges, particularly in correctly reading numbers in the text. B. Finding the best embedding model or approach for the Persian language Finding the best embedding model or approach for the target language in RAG systems is of great importance. These models convert text into numerical vectors, which are semantic representations of the text used for information search and retrieval. The quality and accuracy of information retrieval heavily depend on the performance of the embedding model. To address this challenge, the following methods can be utilized: • Overall Performance Comparison: Evaluating different embedder tools using metrics like retrieval accuracy, processing speed, and resource consumption helps identify the tools that perform best. • Domain-Specific Testing: Testing embedders with data relevant to the specific domain ensures they perform well in the desired field, ensuring optimal real-world performance. • Language Support Evaluation: Ensuring the chosen embedder has strong support for the target language, especially for low -resource languages like Persian, is crucial. • Scalability Assessment: Checking the
