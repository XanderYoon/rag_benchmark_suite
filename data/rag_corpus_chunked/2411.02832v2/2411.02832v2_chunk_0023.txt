in their performance accuracy in English. These findings underscore the importance of considering the volume and quality of training data in the fine -tuning process of large language models for low-resource languages. They also highlight the need to develop new and more efficient methods for optimizing these models for Persian. F. Precise Evaluation of the RAG System's Performance in Answering Factoid Questions In the process of developing and optimizing RAG systems for the Persian language, one of the fundamental challenges is the lack of sufficient insight into the model's performance in responding to various types of factoid questions. This issue can lead to inefficient system design and evaluation. Factoid questions play a crucial role in assessing the quality and efficiency of RAG systems due to their high accuracy requirements and specific answers that are usually directly extractable from the text. These types of questions, especially in low -resource languages like Persian, serve as appropriate benchmarks for measuring the system's ability to retrieve and provide precise information. In this study, the evaluation process was designed and implemented with a special focus on factoid questions in Persian, considering the generalizability of the RAG system across different domains. This approach allows for a more precise and comprehensive assessment of the system's performance in processing and responding to fact -based questions in Persian. This revision integrates the importance of factoid questions into the challenge description, addressing the editor's concern about the paragraph structure. G. Lack of Factoid Datasets for Evaluating RAG Systems One of the fundamental challenges in developing RAG systems for low-resource languages, including Persian, is the lack of appropriate factoid datasets and sufficient evaluation mechanisms. This deficiency makes it challenging to accurately assess the model 's performance in generating correct and relevant responses. In this research, considering a gradual approach in system
