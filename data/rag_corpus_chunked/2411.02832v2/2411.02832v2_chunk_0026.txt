prompt engineering, questions answering in the target language, LLM selection, precise evaluation framework and datasets, hyperparameters optimization and, hallucination reduction. Our experimental results show that the proposed solutions can significantly enhance RAG performance, making it a viable option for low -resource settings. These findings contribute to the broader adoption of retrieval -augmented models in areas with limited access to large -scale data and computational power. Moreover, the solutions proposed in this work offer practical insights for future research on optimizing RAG models in diverse, low resource domains, paving the way for more accessible and robust AI technologies globally.
