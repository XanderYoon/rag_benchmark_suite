a highly relevant and efficient option for generating accurate and enriched responses by incorporating information from external sources. Despite the proven effectiveness of RAG in question-answering systems, multilingual RAG and specifically RAG in Persian, a language with unique characteristics and resource limitations has received less emphasis in research, despite its importance and widespread application. Nevertheless, recent studies have begun to address this gap. Therefore, the current study presents the first successful implementation of Persian RAG system called PersianRAG. The architecture of the PersianRAG system is depicted in Fig. 1. Fig 1. RAG pipeline architecture The components of this architecture are described as follows. A. Knowledge Base The knowledge base serves as a repository of structured information, consisting of processed data that has been organized into meaningful content. This content may include a collection of various texts, scientific articles, wikis, organizational documents, and other curated information sources. The knowledge ba se is continuously updated and serves as the primary input for information retrieval in the RAG system. B. Text Extractor The text extractor is responsible for processing and extracting raw textual content from the knowledge base. These contents may include structured or unstructured documents that need to be transformed into suitable formats for preprocessing. C. Preprocessor After extracting information from the knowledge base, this component cleans and optimizes the texts. Preprocessing includes activities such as removing noise, additional markings, and certain specific characters in various languages. For Persian, for examp le, this might involve removing half - spaces. This stage is crucial, as the quality of input data has a direct impact on final results. D. Embedder The embedder plays a key role in converting texts into vector representations. This process involves using deep learning models to compress textual information into numerical vectors. These vectors, although more compact and with fewer
