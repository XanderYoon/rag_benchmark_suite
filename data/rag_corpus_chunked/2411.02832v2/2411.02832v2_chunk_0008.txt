user's language, while also understanding documents in different languages and following instructions specified in the prompt. While recent advancements in NLP and information retrieval have made suitable candidate components available, this article introduces a multilingual RAG pipeline that claims to have not been previously evaluated in the literature. Therefore, it can serve as an appropriate starting point for designing a Persian RAG, which is considered a multilingual RAG. Although this article pays good attention to various parts of a RAG system for multilingual implementation, addressing Persian RAG requires research tailored to the script, gra mmar, and vocabulary of the Persian language to achieve the best results. Also, the article by Mohammad A. Abdullah [5] presents a case study on the implementation and evaluation of RAG for Arabic texts. This paper focuses exclusively on exploring various semantic embedding models in the retrieval phase and several LLMs in the generation phase to determine which LLMs and se mantic embedding models are suitable for the Arabic language and its unique characteristics. Two objectives are pursued in this study. One of the primary goals is to evaluate the retrieval aspect of RAG by examining how different embedding models perform in the context of Arabic. As the second goal, the paper conducts preliminary analyses to investigate which LLM performs better as a generator in Arabic (with a focus on open-source models). In another study conducted by Hazem Abdelazim et al. [6] on the Arabic language, it is noted that a critical element in RAG systems is the information retrieval component, at the core of which lies the vector embedding process known as "semantic embedding." Their research is focused on studying a set of multilingual semantic embedding models with the aim of effectively enhancing the model's ability to understand and generate Arabic text.
