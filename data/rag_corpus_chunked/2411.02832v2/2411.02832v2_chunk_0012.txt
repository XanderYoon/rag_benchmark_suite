systems. Additionally, the effects of various RAG system components such as the retriever, context length, knowledge base construction, and the LLM have been analyzed. Ultimately, this research provides valuable insights for optimizing RAG technology for different scenarios, offering a comprehensive evaluation framework that contributes to the advancement of RAG systems. However, this is not the only work conducted in the field of multilingual RAG focused on the Chinese language. In another article presented by Shuting Wang et al. [19], it is noted that existing studies, such as the one by Chen et al. [20], primarily rely on general knowledge sources like Wikipedia as external knowledge bases for evaluating RAG models [21], [22, 23]. The authors argue that such an approach may not fully assess the capability of RAG models to solve domain - specific problems. Therefore, utilizing domain -specific datasets and questions is essential for evaluating the ability of LLMs to effectively leverage external knowledge in specific contexts. In this paper, LLMs configured with RAG are evaluated within a specific domain context college enrollment. The study identifies six essential capabilities required for RAG models: conversational RAG, analysis of structured information, fidelity to external knowledge, noise reduction, solving time -sensitive issues, and understanding multi-document interactions. For each capability, relevant datasets with shared tasks are considered to assess the performance of RAG models. The paper evaluates popular LLMs, including models like Llama, Baichuan, ChatGLM, and GPT. Experimental results demonstrate that existing closed -book LLMs struggle with domain-specific questions, highlighting the need for RAG systems to address these chall enges. Furthermore, there is room for RAG models to enhance their abilities in understanding conversational history, analyzing structured information, reducing noise, processing multi -document interactions, and maintaining fidelity to specialized knowledge. As previously noted, unfortunately, most efforts in this field have focused on English
