In particular, we rephrase AudioCaps descriptions to preserve the original meaning while varying the use of temporal conjunctions and prepositions. We investigate if this improves temporal under- standing. Specifically, we generate the 𝐴𝑢𝑑𝑖𝑜𝐶𝑎𝑝𝑠 𝑢𝑛𝑖 dataset with corresponding 𝑇 𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑢𝑛𝑖 , 𝑉 𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑛𝑖 and 𝑇 𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑢𝑛𝑖 subsets based on the AudioCaps dataset. We use two approaches to re-writing the de- scriptions. One is to replace the temporal cues with something that has the same meaning, e.g. ‘Bird singing followed by dog barking’ is equivalent to ‘Bird singing before dog barking’. The second ap- proach is to re-order the text location of events and also change the temporal cue, e.g. ‘Bird singing followed by dog barking’ becomes ‘Dog barking after bird singing’. We present the distribution of temporal cues in the original AudioCaps dataset and its uniform variant in Fig. 4, Fig. 5, and Fig. 6. In addition to the more uniform AudioCaps train, validation and test sets, we create a test subset where at least one of the five text descriptions contains future and past temporal cues (as explained in Sec. 3.1). We do this to evaluate the performance of the model on sentences that actually contain temporal cues of interest. We call this subset TempTest.
