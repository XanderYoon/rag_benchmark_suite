Sophia Koepke Tübingen AI Center, University of Tübingen Tübingen, Germany a-sophia.koepke@uni-tuebingen.de Abstract Recent advancements in machine learning have fueled research on multimodal tasks, such as for instance text-to-video and text- to-audio retrieval. These tasks require models to understand the semantic content of video and audio data, including objects, and characters. The models also need to learn spatial arrangements and temporal relationships. In this work, we analyse the temporal order- ing of sounds, which is an understudied problem in the context of text-to-audio retrieval. In particular, we dissect the temporal under- standing capabilities of a state-of-the-art model for text-to-audio retrieval on the AudioCaps and Clotho datasets. Additionally, we introduce a synthetic text-audio dataset that provides a controlled setting for evaluating temporal capabilities of recent models. Lastly, we present a loss function that encourages text-audio models to fo- cus on the temporal ordering of events.
