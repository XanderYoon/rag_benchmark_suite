obtain a bigger drop on the 𝑟𝑒𝑣 and 𝑟𝑒𝑝 test subsets. This indicates that although Clotho contains considerably more simultaneous actions and the number of future and past temporal cues is greatly dispro- portionate, the loss still helps the model better focus on temporal cues when present. This is observed in Tab. 4. 6 Conclusion In this work, we dissected the temporal understanding capabilities of a current state-of-the-art text-audio model. We first performed an in-depth analysis of the AudioCaps and Clotho text-audio datasets. We concluded that these datasets are not well-suited for obtaining and evaluating temporal understanding capabilities in a text-audio retrieval model. As a result, we proposed a variant of the Audio- Caps dataset, namely AudioCaps𝑢𝑛𝑖 , that contains a more uniform distribution of different temporal cues. We then showed that using AudioCaps𝑢𝑛𝑖 reduces biases learnt by the model and improves performance on the AudioCaps𝑢𝑛𝑖 test set. Furthermore, we intro- duced a synthetic dataset (SynCaps), showing that indeed models fail to use the temporal cues even in a controlled data setting. Lastly, we proposed a simple loss that results in better text-to-audio re- trieval results on SynCaps, whilst also putting more emphasis on the temporal content of the audio and text data in all datasets analysed.
