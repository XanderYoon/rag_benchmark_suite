More details can be found in [24]. 3.3.4 Data used. For our analysis, we construct a more uniform version of the AudioCaps dataset with descriptions having a more Dissecting Temporal Understanding in Text-to-Audio Retrieval MM ’24, October 28-November 1, 2024, Melbourne, VIC, Australia Table 1: Methodology for evaluating the quality of the temporally grounded subset of AudioCaps using an LLM. Our input prompt includes setting the scene, one-shot prompting with an example for generating the evaluation of descriptions in the AudioCaps dataset, followed by the generation of new examples. Prompt Given descriptions of audio files and detailed temporal information about specific sounds within these files, where a sound may be present during multiple, distinct time intervals, your task is to evaluate the accuracy of each description with a primary focus on the timing and sequence of these sounds. Each audio file is 10 seconds long. For every description, assess its accuracy specifically in terms of how well it captures the chronological order and exact timing of sounds. Classify your evaluation into one of three categories: ‘Correct’, ‘Incomplete’, or ‘Wrong’. If necessary, provide a corrected description that not only fixes inaccuracies related to timing but also maintains the original writing style of the description. Your analysis should critically examine the temporal details provided, ensuring your assessment is primarily guided by the accuracy of these temporal sequences. Keep in mind the following: Pay attention
