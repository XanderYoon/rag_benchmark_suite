additionally consider rev and rep subsets of the temporal subset TempTest. In Tab. 3, we take the checkpoint provided by [24] which was pre-trained on the WavCaps [24], AudioCaps [16], and Clotho [9], and finetune it on the original AudioCaps dataset (similar to [24]). We notice that on the reversed TempTest𝑟𝑒𝑣 set the model per- forms worse, indicating that the model understands temporal or- dering. However, on TempTest𝑟𝑒𝑝 which contains the replacement of temporal cues, the model performs similarly to onTempTest. This is interesting, as the temporal ordering of both 𝑇 𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑇 𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑣 and TempTest𝑟𝑒𝑝 is reversed and wrong as compared to TempTest. The Dissecting Temporal Understanding in Text-to-Audio Retrieval MM ’24, October 28-November 1, 2024, Melbourne, VIC, Australia Table 3: Text-to-audio retrieval and audio-to-text retrieval on the AudioCaps and AudioCaps 𝑢𝑛𝑖 datasets for the model fine-tuned on AudioCaps (Train). We report retrieval accu- racies R@1. Reversing the order of events ( rev, rep) does not generally result in a drop in performance, showing that the model does not understand temporal ordering. Lower per- formance on TempTest𝑟𝑒𝑣 might be due to the bias induced by data being described in a future fashion. When this bias is removed from the test set in AudioCaps 𝑢𝑛𝑖 , reversing the order of events does not change performance. Eval Dataset Subset T→A A →T R@1 R@1 AudioCaps Test 43.71 55.44 TempTest 50.06 62.95 TempTest𝑟𝑒𝑣 44.11 57.27 TempTest𝑟𝑒𝑝 49.12 63.12 AudioCaps𝑢𝑛𝑖 Test 41.61 53.80 TempTest 48.04 61.74 TempTest𝑟𝑒𝑣 47.29 62.29 TempTest𝑟𝑒𝑝 47.24 62.23 only difference is that for the former, the actual positional text loca- tions of the sounds are swapped, whilst for the latter the meaning is reversed by changing the temporal connector. This leads us to believe that at best, the model learns text location-based ordering rather than the ordering given by the
