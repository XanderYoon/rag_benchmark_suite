of three categories: ‘Correct’, ‘Incomplete’, or ‘Wrong’. If necessary, provide a corrected description that not only fixes inaccuracies related to timing but also maintains the original writing style of the description. Your analysis should critically examine the temporal details provided, ensuring your assessment is primarily guided by the accuracy of these temporal sequences. Keep in mind the following: Pay attention to whether the description matches the start and end times of sounds accurately. Consider if the sequence of described sounds follows the actual sequence in the audio file. Evaluate if the description misses any sounds within the specified time frames or includes sounds that do not occur within these times. Use similar vocabulary as the original audio description. Example: Input: Original audio description: A power tool motor running then revving Localized components and their start and end times: revving: 2.154, 10.02; a power tool motor running: 0.0, 10.02; Output: Evaluation: Incomplete Corrected description: A power tool motor running throughout, with revving starting early on and continuing alongside the motor’s running sound until the end. Table 2: Proportion of correct, incomplete and wrongly cap- tioned AudioCaps data as determined by an LLM. First row contains the total numbers of temporally grounded descrip- tions. The other rows show proportions for specific temporal cues. Almost a quarter of temporal sentences are incomplete or wrong. Preposition Correct Incomplete Wrong Total (#) 3835 636 503 As (%) 75.3 13.9 10.8 Followed by (%) 60.6 15.3 24.1 Then (%) 62.1 15.9 22.0 While (%) 72.0 15.4 12.6 Before (%) 58.8 9.8 31.4 After (%) 54.5 6.1 39.4 Proceeded by (%) 50.0 0.0 50.0 During (%) 53.3 13.3 33.3 And (%) 75.6 13.5 10.9 balanced distribution of temporal conjunctions and prepositions. In particular, we rephrase AudioCaps descriptions to preserve the original meaning while varying the use of
