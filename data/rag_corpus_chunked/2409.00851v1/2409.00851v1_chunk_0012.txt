comes after ‘Sound 2’, e.g. ‘Bird sings after dog barks’.Future cues include ‘Followed by’, ‘Before’ and ‘Then’, e.g. ‘Bird sings before dog barks’. Forpast, we consider ‘Preceded by’ and ‘After’. Based on the significant proportion of incomplete or wrong descriptions, and the distribution of temporal textual cues, we conclude that AudioCaps is not well-suited for analysing if text-audio models understand temporal ordering in audio clips and descriptions. 3.2 Clotho dataset We examine whether the Clotho [9] dataset, another popular text- audio retrieval dataset, faces similar temporal limitations as Au- dioCaps. Clotho contains pairs of audio clips and text descriptions. Unlike AudioCaps, the train, validation, and test subsets contain five descriptions for each audio file. For a more uniform experimen- tal setting, in the next sections, instead of pairs of one audio and 5 corresponding text descriptions, we split the Clotho training pairs into 5 pairs of one audio (repeated) and one corresponding text description. We investigate the distribution of sentences containing temporal cues in Clotho. We notice in Fig.3 that, similarly to AudioCaps, Clotho contains a non-uniform distribution of temporal cues. How- ever, for Clotho, descriptions mainly feature simultaneous actions, with the words ‘As’ and ‘While’ being used most often. This is followed by future temporal cues such as ‘Then’ or ‘Followed by’. There are three times fewer sentences containing past temporal cues. Therefore, we expect that models trained on Clotho are biased towards simultaneous or in-order (future) events. 3.3 Model performance on AudioCaps and Clotho In this section, we investigate the performance of a state-of-the-art model for text-to-audio retrieval on AudioCaps and Clotho in detail. 3.3.1 Evaluation metrics. Throughout all experiments, we use the standard evaluation metrics for retrieval: recall at rank 𝑘 (R@𝑘). This measures the percentage of targets retrieved within the top 𝑘 ranked results.
