and evaluation on different variants of the data. The second experiment involves reversing the ordering of sounds in the text queries of the test set. We refer to this as𝑇 𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑣 . The purpose of this experiment is to see what happens if the temporal text descriptions keep the same temporal preposition or conjunction but the sound sources are reversed, resulting in a wrongly ordered description, e.g. Birds singing before dog barks becomes Dog barks before birds singing. If the model understands the temporal ordering of events, the model’s performance should drop for the ‘wrongly’ ordered events as compared to the original test set performance. For the third experiment, we replace the temporal cue in a de- scription with its opposite, thus changing the order of events with- out changing their spatial position in the text description, e.g. Birds singing before dog barks becomes Birds singing after dog barks. We refer to this as Test𝑟𝑒𝑝 . More concretely, we make the following re- placements: (‘after’→‘before’), (‘before’→‘after’), (‘then’→‘before’), (‘followed by’→‘preceded by’), and (‘preceded by’→‘followed by’). If the model does not understand temporal cues, we expect it to perform similarly well on Test, Test𝑟𝑒𝑣 and 𝑇 𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑝 . Conversely, if it understands temporal ordering, the Test performance should be considerably higher than Test𝑟𝑒𝑣 and Test𝑟𝑒𝑝 . We would also expect Test𝑟𝑒𝑣 and Test𝑟𝑒𝑝 to be similar, as the meaning of the sentence is the same but opposite of the correctTest sentences. We additionally consider rev and rep subsets of the temporal subset TempTest. In Tab. 3, we take the checkpoint provided by [24] which was pre-trained on the WavCaps [24], AudioCaps [16], and Clotho [9], and finetune it on the original AudioCaps dataset (similar to [24]). We notice that on the reversed TempTest𝑟𝑒𝑣 set the model per- forms worse, indicating that the
