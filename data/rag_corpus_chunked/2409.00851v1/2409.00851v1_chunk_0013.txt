Model performance on AudioCaps and Clotho In this section, we investigate the performance of a state-of-the-art model for text-to-audio retrieval on AudioCaps and Clotho in detail. 3.3.1 Evaluation metrics. Throughout all experiments, we use the standard evaluation metrics for retrieval: recall at rank 𝑘 (R@𝑘). This measures the percentage of targets retrieved within the top 𝑘 ranked results. Higher numbers are better. We report results for text-to-audio (T → A) and audio-to-text retrieval (A → T). We report the mean of three runs that use different random seeds. 3.3.2 Model. We employ the state-of-the-art text-audio model by [24], utilising an HTS-AT audio encoder [4], and a pre-trained BERT encoder for text. After encoding audio and text inputs, an MLP projects the embeddings into the same space. We use the model variant pre-trained on the joint dataset of WavCaps [ 24] + AudioCaps [16] + Clotho [9]. In our experiments, we finetune the model for 40 epochs on the dataset of interest (e.g. AudioCaps, Clotho) and use the same setup as [24]. The best model is selected using the highest average validation retrieval accuracy R@1 on the dataset used for experiments. We run these experiments on A6000s. 3.3.3 Loss function. We use the same loss as [24] - a normalised temperature scaled bidirectional cross-entropy loss (NT-Xent) [7]. We refer to this as L𝑎𝑡 with 𝑠𝑎𝑖𝑡 𝑗 = 𝑓 (𝑎𝑖 ) · 𝑔(𝑡 𝑗 ) ∥𝑓 (𝑎𝑖 ) ∥2 ∥𝑔(𝑡 𝑗 ) ∥2 , (1) L𝑡𝑎 = − 1 2𝐵 Í𝐵 𝑖=1  log  exp(𝑠𝑎𝑖𝑡𝑖 /𝜏)Í𝐵 𝑗=1 exp(𝑠𝑎𝑖𝑡𝑗 /𝜏)  + log  exp(𝑠𝑎𝑖𝑡𝑖 /𝜏)Í𝐵 𝑗=1 exp(𝑠𝑎𝑗 𝑡𝑖 /𝜏)  . (2) Here 𝑓 (·) is the audio encoder and 𝑔(·) the text encoder. 𝑠𝑎𝑖𝑡 𝑗 is the cosine similarity, 𝑎𝑖 the audio input, 𝑡 𝑗 the text input, 𝐵 the
