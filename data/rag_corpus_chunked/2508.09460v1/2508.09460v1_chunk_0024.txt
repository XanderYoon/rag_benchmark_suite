often require multi- ple perspectives to construct a complete evidence subgraph, and starting from just one entity frequently misses critical information. Notably, medical questions (ExplainCPE) benefit more from addi- tional starting points than legal questions (JEC-QA), likely because medical problems often involve more interconnected concepts that necessitate exploration from diverse angles. This result echoes our ablation study conclusions, further demonstrating that exploring knowledge graphs from multiple perspectives is crucial for ensur- ing retrieval comprehensiveness.

ToG (Think-on-Graph) [24] guides LLMs to explore multiple reasoning paths within knowledge graphs through a beam search mechanism, where the model iteratively selects the most promising entities and relations to expand the current path. MindMap [ 30] constructs hierarchical structured representations by first identi- fying key entities, then building subgraph clusters around them, and finally integrating these clusters into a unified knowledge structure for enhanced interpretability. KGGPT [11] handles com- plex queries through a decomposition strategy, breaking down multi-faceted questions into simpler sub-queries and constructing evidence graphs through separate retrieval processes for each com- ponent. Despite their sophisticated exploration strategies, these methods operate as open-loop systems that generate evidence paths in a single forward pass without mechanisms to assess or refine path quality during the retrieval process. Self-Refinement Methods. The importance of quality con- trol in retrieval has been recognized in the broader RAG domain, leading to several self-refinement approaches. ReAct [
