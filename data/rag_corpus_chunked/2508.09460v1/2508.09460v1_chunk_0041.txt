well-grounded response. Generate Answer: The model might mention a risk but cannot provide a clear explanation, or it may be confused by the fragmented evidence and fail to definitively identify (B) as incorrect. Our Method (MetaKGRAG): 1. Initial Path Generation : Generates a similar preliminary path: Donepezil → treats → Alzheimer’s Disease . 2. Perceive-Evaluate-Adjust Cycle: Perceive: The framework assesses the path’s coverage and detects that the relationship withNSAIDs is missing. Evaluate: It diagnoses a Completeness Deficiency, flagging co_administration_with_NSAIDs as the missing concept (Cmissing). Adjust: Instead of a disconnected search, it performs a trajectory-connected correction. It selects Cholinesterase Inhibitor as a strategic restart point to explore its class-level properties. Refined Path (Coherent and Connected) : 1. Donepezil is_a − − − →Cholinesterase Inhibitor 2. Cholinesterase Inhibitor increases − − − − − − − →Gastric Acid Secretion 3. Gastric Acid Secretion heightens_risk_with − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − →NSAIDs 4. NSAIDs can_cause − − − − − − − − →Gastrointestinal Bleeding Generate Answer: With the complete and connected evidence path, the model understands the full causal chain: Donepezil increases gastric acid, which heightens the risk of bleeding when combined with NSAIDs. It thus confidently and correctly identifies statement (B) as incorrect. 13
