cycle, MetaKGRAG establishes multiple starting points to ensure comprehensive exploration. Given question 𝑄, we use an LLM to extract key concepts𝐶 = {𝑐1, 𝑐2, ..., 𝑐𝑘 } that represent the essential information needs. This extraction is domain-aware, prioritizing technical terms and named entities rel- evant to the task. For each concept 𝑐𝑖, we identify corresponding entities in G through semantic matching. Specifically, we compute the semantic similarity: sim(𝑐𝑖, 𝑒𝑗 ) = v𝑐𝑖 ·v𝑒 𝑗 || v𝑐𝑖 || · || v𝑒 𝑗 || where v𝑐𝑖 and v𝑒 𝑗 are the embedding vectors of concept 𝑐𝑖 and entity 𝑒 𝑗 respectively. To ensure quality, we only select the most semantically similar entities for each concept, subject to a minimum similarity threshold: 𝐸0 = {arg max 𝑒 ∈ E sim(𝑐𝑖, 𝑒) : 𝑐𝑖 ∈ 𝐶} where we only retain entities with sim(𝑐𝑖, 𝑒) > 𝜏𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑡 𝑦 to ensure high-quality matches, and 𝜏𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑡 𝑦 is the entity matching thresh- old. This results in a set of high-confidence starting points 𝐸0 = {𝑒1, 𝑒2, ..., 𝑒𝑚 }. Each starting entity initiates an independent re- trieval path. This multi-perspective approach ensures that different aspects of the query are explored, reducing the risk of missing crucial information due to a single suboptimal starting point. For each starting entity 𝑒 ∈ 𝐸0, we first generate an initial candidate path 𝑃𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑒 through greedy exploration from𝑒, following edges with the highest relevance to query 𝑄. 3.3 Metacognitive Iteration Cycle This iterative cycle is the core of our framework. It takes a candi- date evidence path and progressively refines it by diagnosing and correcting its flaws. The cycle consists of three distinct modules: Perception, Evaluation, and Adjustment. • Perception Module. The Perception module acts as a qual- ity sensor for the initial candidate path. Let 𝐸𝑃 = {𝑒 : 𝑒 ∈
