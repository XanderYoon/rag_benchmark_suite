A threshold set too low might accept noisy entities, while one set too high could prematurely discard useful ones. To assess the framework’s sensi- tivity to this parameter, we conducted a tuning experiment on both ExplainCPE and JEC-QA datasets, varying 𝜏𝑐 from 0.1 to 0.5. The results are illustrated in Figure 5 (a). As shown in the figure, the model’s performance remains highly stable across the entire range of 𝜏𝑐 values. For both datasets, the accuracy fluctuates by less than 0.4%, with a slight peak around 𝜏𝑐 = 0.3. This indicates that while a reasonably calibrated threshold is beneficial, MetaKGRAG is not overly sensitive to its precise value. The framework’s robustness in this regard simplifies its deployment in new domains, as it does not require extensive, dataset-specific tuning of this parameter. C.3 Analysis of Weight Adjustment The weight adjustment parameter, 𝛿, controls the magnitude of the positive or negative incentive applied to entities during the Strategic Re-exploration phase of the Adjustment module. A larger 𝛿 more aggressively steers the search away from misleading entities and towards missing concepts. We validated the impact of 𝛿 by testing values from 0.1 to 0.5. The results, depicted in Figure 5 (b), demonstrate that the framework exhibits low sensitivity to the specific value of 𝛿. Performance on both datasets forms a plateau, with optimal results achieved for 𝛿 values between 0.2 and 0.3. The minimal variation in accuracy suggests that as long as the adjustment provides a clear
