effectively re-route the trajectory. This iterative cycle operationalizes the principle of self-correction. By assessing a fully generated candidate path and using that diag- nosis to inform a subsequent, more targeted search, the framework systematically improves the quality of evidence before it is passed to the LLM. The overall algorithm is detailed in Algorithm 1.

Given question 𝑄, we use an LLM to extract key concepts𝐶 = {𝑐1, 𝑐2, ..., 𝑐𝑘 } that represent the essential information needs. This extraction is domain-aware, prioritizing technical terms and named entities rel- evant to the task. For each concept 𝑐𝑖, we identify corresponding entities in G through semantic
