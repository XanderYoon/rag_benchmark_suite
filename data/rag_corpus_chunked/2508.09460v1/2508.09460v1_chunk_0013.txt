𝑤 𝑎𝑑 𝑗𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑑 (𝑒𝑖, 𝑒𝑗 ) = 𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙 (𝑒𝑖, 𝑒𝑗 ) + adjustment(𝑒 𝑗 ) (2) Executing an Informed Re-search. Rather than restarting from scratch, the module selects a strategic restart point from the previous path. For Completeness Deficiency, it chooses the entity most relevant to the missing concepts. For Rele- vance Deficiency, it selects the entity with the highest global support: 𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡 = arg max 𝑒 ∈𝐸𝑃 𝑓 (𝑒) where 𝑓 (𝑒) = ( max𝑐 ∈ C𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔 sim(𝑒, 𝑐) Completeness issue GlobalSupport(𝑒, 𝑄, 𝐶) Relevance issue The system then performs greedy search from 𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡 , se- lecting the next entity with maximum adjusted weight at each step until a new candidate path is generated. This targeted re-exploration mechanism directly addresses the diagnosed issues, efficiently correcting the path’s trajectory with- out losing all prior progress. The metacognitive cycle repeats until one of three convergence conditions is met: (1) the Evaluation module detects no deficien- cies, (2) the change between the new path and the previous one is minimal, measured by entity overlap similarity exceeding a thresh- old 𝜏𝑠𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑡 𝑦 , or (3) a maximum iteration limit 𝑁𝑚𝑎𝑥 is reached. 4 Towards Self-cognitive Exploration: Metacognitive Knowledge Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation Specifically, two paths are considered similar if: PathSimilarity(𝑃1, 𝑃2) = |𝐸𝑃1 ∩ 𝐸𝑃2 | |𝐸𝑃1 ∪ 𝐸𝑃2 | > 𝜏𝑠𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑡 𝑦 where 𝐸𝑃1 and 𝐸𝑃2 are the entity sets of the two paths. In our implementation, we set the default 𝑁𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 3 and 𝜏𝑠𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑡 𝑦 = 0.8 based on empirical validation. 3.4 Multi-Evidence Integration and Answer Generation After all initial entities complete their independent metacognitive cycles, MetaKGRAG performs comprehensive multi-path integra- tion to synthesize the collected evidence. The evidence synthesis process merges all refined paths into a comprehensive evidence subgraph S while removing duplicate information, thus preserving diverse perspectives while
