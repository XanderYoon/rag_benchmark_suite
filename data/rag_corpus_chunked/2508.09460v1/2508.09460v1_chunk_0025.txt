each com- ponent. Despite their sophisticated exploration strategies, these methods operate as open-loop systems that generate evidence paths in a single forward pass without mechanisms to assess or refine path quality during the retrieval process. Self-Refinement Methods. The importance of quality con- trol in retrieval has been recognized in the broader RAG domain, leading to several self-refinement approaches. ReAct [ 32] intro- duces a reasoning-acting loop where the system can perform new searches based on intermediate reasoning states, using action se- quences like "Search[query]" and "Finish[answer]" to iteratively gather evidence. FLARE [10] employs a forward-looking approach that generates answers incrementally, triggering retrieval when confidence drops below a threshold, thus ensuring continuous evi- dence support throughout generation. Self-RAG [1] implements a more comprehensive framework with reflection tokens that enable the model to critique its own outputs and decide whether to retrieve additional information, revise responses, or continue generation. These methods excel in document-based retrieval, where individual pieces of evidence can be independently assessed and substituted. However, this approach mismatches the path-dependent nature of graph exploration, where each step constrains subsequent choices and simple replacement invalidates entire reasoning chains. CONCLUSION In this paper, we proposed MetaKGRAG, a novel framework that enhances Knowledge Graph RAG by integrating a human-inspired metacognitive process to solve Cognitive Blindness. Through its Perceive-Evaluate-Adjust cycle, MetaKGRAG empowers the sys- tem to identify path-level deficiencies like incomplete evidence and relevance drift, and to perform targeted, trajectory-connected corrections. Experimental results across diverse medical, legal, and commonsense datasets demonstrated the superior performance of MetaKGRAG over strong baselines. For future work, we aim to explore more advanced, learnable adjustment strategies to further enhance the efficiency and adaptability of the metacognitive cycle.
