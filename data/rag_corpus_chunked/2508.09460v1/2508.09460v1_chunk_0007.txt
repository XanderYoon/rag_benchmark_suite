This transforms the path generation process from a blind execution into a reflective one by operationalizing metacognitive principles into an evidence-level 2 Towards Self-cognitive Exploration: Metacognitive Knowledge Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation Domain-specific Knowledge Graph # 1 User Query # 2 Knowledge Exploration Query Concepts Concepts Extraction Extractor Candidate Paths Retrieval Concepts Candidate Paths Perception Evaluation Adjustment # 3 Metacognitive Iteration Cycle # 4 Evidence Integration & Answer Query Evidences Answer LLMs Doctor, I have chest pain and indigestion, and it gets worse when I lie down.

It iteratively refines graph exploration via a path-aware Perceive- Evaluate-Adjust cycle to address cognitive blindness in relevance drift and incomplete evidence. refinement cycle. At its core, MetaKGRAG is driven by a Perceive- Evaluate-Adjust cycle. This cycle is an iterative process that as- sesses a fully generated candidate path to inform a more strategic subsequent search. • Perceive:
