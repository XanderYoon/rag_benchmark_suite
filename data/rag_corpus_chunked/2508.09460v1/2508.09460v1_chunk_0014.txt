The evidence synthesis process merges all refined paths into a comprehensive evidence subgraph S while removing duplicate information, thus preserving diverse perspectives while eliminating redundancy. The evidence subgraph is then converted to natural language con- text through a structured transformation. Each triple (ℎ𝑖, 𝑟𝑖, 𝑡𝑖 ) ∈ S is converted into natural language statements following the tem- plate “Evidence𝑖: ℎ𝑖 𝑟𝑖 𝑡𝑖”, creating a structured evidence list that maintains the semantic relationships between entities while being interpretable by the LLM. Finally, the LLM generates the answer 𝐴 using both the original question𝑄 and the curated evidence context through a prompt that instructs the model to analyze the evidence and answer the question. The complete prompt template for answer generation is detailed in Appendix 7. 4 EXPERIMENTS 4.1 Experimental Setup 4.1.1 Datasets. As shown in Tab 1, to evaluate MetaKGRAG’s effectiveness and generalization ability across diverse domains, we conduct experiments on five datasets spanning commonsense, medical, and legal domains. Table 1: The statistics of datasets. Domain Dataset Questions Language Commonsense CommonsenseQA 700 English Medical CMB-Exam 2,000 Chinese ExplainCPE 507 Chinese webMedQA 500 Chinese Legal JEC-QA 479 Chinese We use CommonsenseQA [25] for commonsense knowledge eval- uation, which contains multiple-choice questions requiring broad knowledge integration. For medical domains, we employ three datasets, CMB-Exam [26] with 2,000 sampled questions from Chi- nese medical professional examinations (including Nursing, Phar- macy, Postgraduate, and Professional), ExplainCPE [13] containing pharmaceutical questions from the National Licensed Pharmacist Examination with both answers and explanations, and webMedQA [9] featuring real-world patient-doctor conversations from online med- ical platforms. For legal domain, we use JEC-QA
