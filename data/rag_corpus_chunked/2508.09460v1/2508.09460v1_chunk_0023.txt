cepts) and the maximum iteration number𝑁𝑚𝑎𝑥 . As shown in Fig. 3 (a), 𝜏𝑐𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒 performs optimally around 0.6 across both datasets. This is because a threshold set too low risks triggering unneces- sary adjustments for irrelevant concepts, while one set too high may fail to identify and correct important evidence gaps. For𝑁𝑚𝑎𝑥 , as shown in Fig. 3 (b), its performance peaks at 3 iterations and then stabilizes, suggesting that most path deficiencies can be ef- fectively resolved within three cycles, with further iterations offer- ing diminishing returns. The consistency of these optimal values across different domains validates our default parameter choices and demonstrates the framework’s robustness. Multi-start Retrieval Analysis. To quantify the importance of the multi-start retrieval strategy, we analyze the impact of the num- ber of starting entities on final performance.

(c), accuracy on both datasets improves significantly as the number of starting entities increases, reaching an optimal point at 5 before plateauing. This is because complex questions often require multi- ple perspectives to construct a complete evidence subgraph, and starting from just one entity frequently misses critical information. Notably, medical questions (ExplainCPE) benefit more from addi- tional starting points than legal questions (JEC-QA), likely because medical problems often involve more interconnected concepts that necessitate exploration from diverse angles. This result echoes our ablation study conclusions, further demonstrating
