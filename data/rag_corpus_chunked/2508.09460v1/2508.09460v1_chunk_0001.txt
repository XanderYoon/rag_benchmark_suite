limited by hallu- cinations and outdated internal knowledge [18, 20, 36]. Retrieval- Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates these issues by grounding LLMs in external knowledge [6, 8]. While standard RAG uses un- structured text, Knowledge Graph RAG (KG-RAG) [5, 7, 33] lever- ages explicit, structured relationships. This enables a more verifi- able reasoning process, making it particularly powerful for complex queries that require connecting multiple pieces of information (i.e., multi-hop reasoning) to deliver precise answers [11, 14, 16, 21]. Despite these advantages, the effectiveness of KG-RAG is often undermined by a challenge inherent in its exploration process. Cur- rent KG-RAG methods typically operate as open-loop systems, generating an evidence path in a single linear pass without a feed- back mechanism [24, 30].
