to graph self-assessment Chest Pain Angina Indigestion ... I am confused... Figure 1: The comparisons of KG-RAG pipeline, Self- Refinement methods and our MetaKGRAG. (a) Typical KG- RAG suffers from cognitive blindness issues, leading to rel- evance drift and incomplete evidence. (b) Self-Refinement struggles to adapt to KG-RAG due to overlooking path depen- dency of graph exploration. (c) Our MetaKGRAG achieves graph-based self-cognition through a metacognitive cycle. Cognitive Blindness, a state where the system is unaware of its own exploration deficiencies. As shown in Fig. 1 (a), a real-world medical query: “Doctor, I have chest pain and indigestion, and it gets worse when I lie down. Could this be a heart problem?” . Tradi- tional KG-RAG methods typically employ a greedy search based on local similarity. In this case, “chest pain” has a strong semantic link to heart disease, biasing the system towards this path. As the exploration deepens from “chest pain” to “Angina” and then “Coro- nary Artery Disease”, it progressively diverges from other crucial evidence paths, leading to relevance drift. As the system delves into the cardiac subgraph, this drift causes it to overlook key con- cepts such as “indigestion” and “worse when lying down”, resulting in incomplete evidence. Ultimately, an incorrect answer (heart disease) is generated. Due to the absence of an effective feedback mechanism, current KG-RAG methods struggle to recognize these drifts and omissions, thereby impacting their overall performance. To address the cognitive blindness issue, a natural inclination is to apply self-refinement mechanism of current text-based RAG methods [10, 32]. They assess discrete units of evidence (e.g., text chunks), if a flaw is found, they can substitute the faulty piece or trigger a second-time searching to fetch a new evidence. However, 1 arXiv:2508.09460v1 [cs.IR] 13 Aug 2025 Xujie et al. this paradigm is inappropriate for adapting
