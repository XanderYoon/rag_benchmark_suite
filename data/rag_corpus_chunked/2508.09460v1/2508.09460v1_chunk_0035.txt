datasets to build specialized KGs. The prompt example is shown in Tab. 8. All KGs were deployed using Neo4j3. C COMPLEMENTARY EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS C.1 Analysis of Generative Quality In addition to evaluating answer accuracy, we assessed the qual- ity of the generated explanations for tasks requiring free-form responses (ExplainCPE and webMedQA). We used ROUGE-L to measure lexical overlap with reference answers and G-Eval to eval- uate the Coherence, Consistency, Fluency, and Relevance of the generated text. The results, presented in Table 9, demonstrate that MetaKGRAG’s advantages extend beyond correctness to signifi- cantly enhance generative quality. Across both datasets, MetaK- GRAG consistently achieves the highest scores in all evaluated dimensions. For instance, on ExplainCPE, MetaKGRAG (Qwen2.5- 72B) achieves a ROUGE-L score of 28.45, a substantial improvement of over 4.4 points compared to the best-performing baseline (Meta RAG). This significant improvement can be attributed to the high- quality evidence subgraphs produced by our metacognitive cycle. The path-aware refinement process does not just retrieve relevant facts; it constructs a coherent, logically connected evidence nar- rative. This well-structured context enables the LLM to generate answers that are not only factually accurate but also more fluent, consistent, and directly relevant to the user’s query. In contrast, while other retrieval methods provide a performance lift, the poten- tially fragmented or incomplete evidence they retrieve limits the ultimate quality of the generated text. This analysis confirms that the path-level self-correction of MetaKGRAG is crucial for both accuracy and the quality of explanatory generation. 1https://www.langchain.com/ 2https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp 3https://neo4j.com/ 10 Towards Self-cognitive Exploration: Metacognitive Knowledge Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation C.2 Analysis of Concept Relevance Threshold The concept relevance threshold,𝜏𝑐, is a hyperparameter within the Evaluation module used to determine if an entity provides meaning- ful support for a query concept (i.e., if sim(𝑒, 𝑐) > 𝜏𝑐).
