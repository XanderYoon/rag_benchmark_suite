our MetaKGRAG framework. It iteratively refines graph exploration via a path-aware Perceive- Evaluate-Adjust cycle to address cognitive blindness in relevance drift and incomplete evidence. refinement cycle. At its core, MetaKGRAG is driven by a Perceive- Evaluate-Adjust cycle. This cycle is an iterative process that as- sesses a fully generated candidate path to inform a more strategic subsequent search. • Perceive: What is the quality of my current path? After gen- erating an initial candidate path, the framework first Perceives its overall quality. This involves a holistic assessment of the entire path, checking how well its constituent entities cover the key concepts of the query. This step provides the raw self-awareness that traditional open-loop KG-RAG methods lack. • Evaluate: What are the specific problems? Based on the perceived metrics, the framework Evaluates the path to diagnose specific, pre-defined issues. It explicitly checks if the path suffers from a Completeness Deficiency (i.e., key concepts are missed) or a Relevance Deficiency (i.e., the path has drifted into an irrelevant subgraph). This turns a vague sense of “low quality" into an actionable diagnosis. • Adjust: How can I correct the trajectory? In stark contrast to the disconnected re-retrievals of other methods, the adjustment is a trajectory-connected correction. Based on the diagnosis, the system performs a Strategic Re-exploration. This involves iden- tifying the optimal pivot point on the flawed path, formulating a new search strategy, and initiating a new, smarter exploration from that point to effectively re-route the trajectory. This iterative cycle operationalizes the principle of self-correction. By assessing a fully generated candidate path and using that diag- nosis to inform a subsequent, more targeted search, the framework systematically improves the quality of evidence before it is passed to the LLM. The overall algorithm is detailed in Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1 Metacognitive Knowledge Graph RAG
