disease isincorrect? A. Cholinesterase inhibitors can increase the risk of stomach bleeding. B. Donepezil is suitable for co-administration with NSAIDs. C. Memantine’s clearance can be affected by urinary pH. D. Galantamine’s metabolism can be inhibited by ketoconazole. Baseline Method (Vanilla KG-RAG): Analysis: Employs a greedy search. It strongly associates Donepezil with its primary function, treating Alzheimer’s , and explores this path, overlooking the interaction with NSAIDs. Initial Path: 1. Donepezil treats − − − − →Alzheimer’s Disease 2. Donepezil is_a − − − →Cholinesterase Inhibitor Problem Diagnosis: Incomplete Evidence : The path completely fails to retrieve the critical information about the adverse interaction between Cholinesterase Inhibitors and NSAIDs. Generate Answer: Based on the retrieved evidence, the model cannot identify the incorrect statement. It might wrongly conclude that statement (B) is plausible. Self-Refinement Method: Analysis: After generating an initial path like the baseline, the refinement mechanism recognizes the answer is insufficient as it doesn’t address NSAIDs. Corrective Action (Flawed): It triggers a separate and isolated search for the interaction between Donepezil and NSAIDs. This returns a new, isolated fact: Cholinesterase Inhibitors + NSAIDs → increased risk of GI bleeding . Problem Diagnosis (Path Dependency Failure) : The system now has two disconnected evidence fragments. It cannot integrate the new interaction fact with the original path. It fails to build a coherent reasoning chain explainingwhy the interaction occurs (e.g., via increased gastric acid secretion), and thus struggles to synthesize a confident and well-grounded response. Generate Answer: The model might mention a risk but cannot provide a clear explanation, or it may be confused by the fragmented evidence and fail to definitively identify (B) as incorrect. Our Method (MetaKGRAG): 1. Initial Path Generation : Generates a similar preliminary path: Donepezil → treats → Alzheimer’s Disease . 2. Perceive-Evaluate-Adjust Cycle: Perceive: The framework assesses
