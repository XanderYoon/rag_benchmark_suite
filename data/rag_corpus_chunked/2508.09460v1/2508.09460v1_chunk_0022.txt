To gain deeper insights into the internal mechanisms and effectiveness of our MetaKGRAG framework, we conduct a series of detailed analyses across multiple dimensions. Effectiveness Analysis. We first verify whether MetaKGRAG’s metacognitive cycle genuinely improves evidence quality through effective path refinement. We introduce the Path Refinement Rate (PRR) metric to quantify the degree of change in final evidence paths relative to initial paths. As shown in Fig. 4, our MetaKGRAG method demonstrates a high path refinement rate of 38.5% while achieving 85.97% accuracy. In contrast, baselines that simply incorporate self- refinement methods (Meta RAG and ReAct) exhibit refinement rates below 15% with correspondingly lower accuracy, while ToG shows zero refinement. This strong correlation between a high refinement rate and high accuracy proves that our adjustments are targeted and beneficial; our method makes more meaningful changes to improve answer quality, whereas other methods either do not refine the path or make fewer, less effective adjustments. Parameter Sensitivity Analysis. We examine the framework’s sensitivity to two core hyperparameters: the coverage threshold 𝜏𝑐𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒 (used to judge path entity coverage of question key con- cepts) and the maximum iteration number𝑁𝑚𝑎𝑥 . As shown in Fig. 3 (a), 𝜏𝑐𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒 performs optimally around 0.6 across both datasets. This is because a threshold set too low risks triggering unneces- sary adjustments for irrelevant concepts, while one set too high may fail to identify and correct important evidence gaps.
