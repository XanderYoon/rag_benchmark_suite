path entities to identify specific deficiencies: (1) To detect Completeness Deficiency, it flags concepts whose coverage scores are below a threshold𝜏𝑐𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒 as the set of missing concepts C𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔 . This indicates that the current path has failed to explore entities relevant to certain key concepts. (2) To detect Relevance Deficiency,it scrutinizes each entity in the path by calculating its GlobalSupport(𝑒, 𝑄, 𝐶). This metric balances concept coverage with overall question relevance: EntityScope(𝑒, 𝐶) = |{𝑐 ∈ 𝐶 : sim(𝑒, 𝑐) > 𝜏𝑐 }| |𝐶 | GlobalSupport(𝑒, 𝑄, 𝐶) = 𝛼 ·EntityScope(𝑒, 𝐶) + (1 − 𝛼) ·sim(𝑒, 𝑄) where EntityScope(𝑒, 𝐶) measures how many concepts en- tity 𝑒 is relevant to, 𝛼 balances the two components, and 𝜏𝑐 is the concept relevance threshold. Entities with low global support are flagged as misleading. The evaluation module produces a diagnosis I of the issues found in 𝑃𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑒 . • Adjustment Module. If deficiencies are diagnosed (I ≠ ∅), this module executes a corrective action. Instead of triggering new, independent searches, our approach performs a targeted correc- tion of the flawed trajectory itself. This Strategic re-exploration process involves: (1) Formulating an Adjustment Strategy . For a Completeness Deficiency, the system identifies external entities relevant to the missing concepts C𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔 and assigns them a posi- tive weight adjustment +𝛿. For a Relevance Deficiency, it assigns a negative weight adjustment −𝛿 to misleading en- tities. These adjustments modify the original edge weights during subsequent exploration: 𝑤 𝑎𝑑 𝑗𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑑 (𝑒𝑖, 𝑒𝑗 ) = 𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙 (𝑒𝑖, 𝑒𝑗 ) + adjustment(𝑒 𝑗 ) (2) Executing an Informed Re-search. Rather than restarting from scratch, the module selects a strategic restart point from the previous path. For Completeness Deficiency, it chooses the entity most relevant to the missing concepts. For Rele- vance Deficiency, it selects the entity with the highest
