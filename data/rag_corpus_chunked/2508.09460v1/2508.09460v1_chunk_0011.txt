iterative cycle is the core of our framework. It takes a candi- date evidence path and progressively refines it by diagnosing and correcting its flaws. The cycle consists of three distinct modules: Perception, Evaluation, and Adjustment. • Perception Module. The Perception module acts as a qual- ity sensor for the initial candidate path. Let 𝐸𝑃 = {𝑒 : 𝑒 ∈ head or tail of any triple in 𝑃𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑒 } be the set of entities in the path. It computes a coverage map M by assessing how well the path covers each key concept 𝑐𝑖 ∈ 𝐶: Coverage(𝑐𝑖 ) = max 𝑒 ∈𝐸𝑃 sim(𝑐𝑖, 𝑒) This provides the raw data for self-assessment. • Evaluation Module. Based on the output from the Perception module, the Evaluation module acts as a diagnostic engine. It formalizes and diagnoses the two key deficiencies discussed in the introduction. A path 𝑃 may suffer from: – Completeness Deficiency, if it fails to cover all key as- pects. Formally, a path𝑃 is deficient in completeness if there exists a concept 𝑐𝑖 ∈ 𝐶 for which the coverage, defined as max𝑒 ∈entities(𝑃 ) sim(𝑐𝑖, 𝑒), falls below a threshold 𝜏𝑐𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒 . – Relevance Deficiency, if it contains entities that are only locally relevant to one aspect but have low relevance to the overall query 𝑄. Formally, a path 𝑃 is deficient in relevance if it contains entities with a low GlobalSupport score. To implement this, the module analyzes the path entities to identify specific deficiencies: (1) To detect Completeness Deficiency, it flags concepts whose coverage scores are below a threshold𝜏𝑐𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒 as the set of missing concepts C𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔 . This indicates that the current path has failed to explore entities relevant to certain key concepts. (2) To detect Relevance Deficiency,it scrutinizes each entity in the path by calculating its GlobalSupport(𝑒,
