To gain deeper insights into the specific mechanisms driving MetaKGRAG’s performance, we conduct fine- grained ablation studies that examine individual functional compo- nents within our framework. Rather than removing entireMetacog- nitive Cycle, we selectively disable specific mechanisms to un- derstand their individual contributions. In Evaluation module,Com- pleteness Check identifies missing key concepts,Relevance Check detects entities to prevent misleading information. In Adjustment module, Strategic Restart intelligently selects optimal starting points for path re-exploration when issues are detected, rather than naively restarting from the original entity. Table 6 shows that Completeness Check provides the largest contribution (5.04% on ExplainCPE, 5.48% on JEC-QA and 2.39% on CommonsenseQA), indicating that ensuring comprehensive infor- mation coverage is more critical than filtering irrelevant content. Relevance Check contributes substantially (4.32%, 4.22%, and 1.99% respectively), demonstrating the importance of avoiding misleading entities that satisfy keyword matching without providing mean- ingful information. Strategic Restart offers consistent but modest gains (3.16%, 3.56%, and 1.29%), proving that intelligent restart point selection outperforms naive re-exploration strategies.
