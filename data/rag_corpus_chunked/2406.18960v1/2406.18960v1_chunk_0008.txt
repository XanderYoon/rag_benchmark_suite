Each query rewrite ˆ/u1D45E/u1D457 /u1D456 has an associated rewrite score: /u1D445/u1D446 ( ˆ/u1D45E /u1D457 /u1D456) = /u1D443( ˆ/u1D45E /u1D457 /u1D456| /u1D43B) = /parenlefttpA /parenleftexA /parenleftexA /parenleftbtA | ˆ/u1D45E/u1D457 /u1D456|/productdisplay.1 /u1D459=1 /u1D443( /u1D461/u1D459| /u1D461/u1D459− 1, . . . , /u1D461 1, /u1D43B) ) /parenrighttpA /parenrightexA /parenrightexA /parenrightbtA 1 | ˆ/u1D45E/u1D457 /u1D456| , where /u1D4611, . . . , /u1D461/u1D459are the predicted tokens, | ˆ/u1D45E/u1D457 /u1D456| is the sequence length of the /u1D457th query rewrite, and /u1D43Bis the conversation history (cf. Sec- tion 3.1.1). Considering that RS is the product of the probab ilities of all terms in a sequence, length normalization is applied t o avoid the query rewriters’ tendency to generate very short rewrit es. A Surprisingly Simple yet Eﬀective Multi-/Q_uery Rewriting Met hod for Conversational Passage Retrieval SIGIR ’24, July 14– 18, 2024, Washington, DC, USA Due to the quadratic complexity with respect to the input siz e, a common practice is to limit the input to a maximum of 512 to- kens [18]. To accommodate this restriction, we limit the con text to the previously rewritten utterances, ⟨ ˆ/u1D45E1, . . . , ˆ/u1D45E/u1D456− 1⟩, and the last system response, /u1D45F/u1D456− 1. We do not rewrite the very ﬁrst user ut- terance of a conversation under the assumption that it is alr eady self-contained and states the necessary context (i.e., ˆ/u1D45E1 = /u1D45E1). Next, we discuss how to utilize multiple query rewrites in va ri- ous components of a retrieval pipeline. 3.2 Sparse Retrieval Sparse retrieval relies on a bag-of-words text representat ion, where each query term contributes to the document relevance es- timate according to some scoring function, which is general ly of the
