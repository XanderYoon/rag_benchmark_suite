weakest model (T5QR /u1D440/u1D44E/u1D45B/u1D462/u1D44E/u1D459), suggesting that the term im- portance and query expansion methods have a major eﬀect. Thi s observation is further supported by the smallest gain obser ved with ConvGQR, which has integrated query expansion. Second , for both the sparse and dense retrieval groups, our CMQR meth od consistently outperforms all other methods on the overall Q ReCC dataset, achieving the best and second-best results, there by set- ting a new state of the art. The strongest performance of CMQR with T5QR/u1D43F/u1D43F/u1D440, a single t5-base model, is notable for its compact 2https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/gtr-t5 -base size compared to previous best-performing methods, speciﬁ cally the dual- t5-base model (ConvGQR) and the two-step LLM model (LLM/u1D44E/u1D451ℎ/u1D45C/u1D450). Ye et al. [32] show LLM /u1D44E/u1D451ℎ/u1D45C/u1D450is 6 times slower than T5QR/u1D43F/u1D43F/u1D440making it impractical in real-world conversational ap- plications. Finally, manual rewrites, representing human eﬀort in query rewriting, show strong performance, especially on th e test- only TREC-CAsT dataset. However, CMQR methods still surpas s these human eﬀorts on the overall QReCC dataset, underscori ng the potential of automated systems to enhance retrieval tas ks. In- terestingly, adding CMQR to the model trained on manual rewrites (T5QR/u1D440/u1D44E/u1D45B/u1D462/u1D44E/u1D459) almost reaches the performance of manual rewrites, while CMQR applied to T5QR/u1D43F/u1D43F/u1D440shows an absolute improvement of 10.91 MRR percentage points compared to the manual rewrit e. 6 CONCLUSION In this paper, we developed a method for generating multiplequery rewrites for conversational search and explored how these c an be incorporated into sparse and dense retrieval. This approach diﬀers from the majority of previous work, where only a single query rewrite is used. We showed how multiple queries can be eﬃcien tly integrated at virtually no extra cost for both sparse and den se re- trieval. Furthermore, we demonstrated that our method can b e ap- plied on top
