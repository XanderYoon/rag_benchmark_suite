be incorporated into sparse and dense retrieval. This approach diﬀers from the majority of previous work, where only a single query rewrite is used. We showed how multiple queries can be eﬃcien tly integrated at virtually no extra cost for both sparse and den se re- trieval. Furthermore, we demonstrated that our method can b e ap- plied on top of existing query rewriting methods that employ gen- erative query rewriting, yielding consistent improvement s across all methods and resulting in state-of-the-art performance . A Surprisingly Simple yet Eﬀective Multi-/Q_uery Rewriting Met hod for Conversational Passage Retrieval SIGIR ’24, July 14– 18, 2024, Washington, DC, USA In future work, we plan to employ multi-query rewrites also i n the re-ranking components of multi-stage retrieval pipeli nes and determine automatically the number of rewrites to consider .
