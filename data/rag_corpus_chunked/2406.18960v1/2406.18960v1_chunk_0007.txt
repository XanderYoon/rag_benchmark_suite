up to that point: ˆ/u1D45E/u1D456 = /u1D45F/u1D452/u1D464/u1D45F/u1D456/u1D461/u1D452( ˆ/u1D45E1, /u1D45F1, ˆ/u1D45E2, /u1D45F2, . . . , ˆ/u1D45E/u1D456− 1, /u1D45F/u1D4561, /u1D45E/u1D456) . The rewritten query ˆ/u1D45E/u1D456 is considered self-contained and can be used downstream in v ari- ous components of the retrieval pipeline. 3.1.2 Motivation. The majority of recent approaches employ gen- erative neural models for CQR [15]. However, these models of ten fail to ﬁnd omitted information or detect topic shifts in lon ger con- versations [31]. In some cases, query rewrites introduce ir relevant terms, while in other cases, relevant terms are missing (aki n to the notion of topic drift in pseudo relevance feedback [20, 27]) . We hypothesize that it is often too challenging to accurately c apture the user’s information need in a single query rewrite. There fore, instead of returning a single most likely rewrite, we propos e to re- turn the top /u1D45Bquery rewrites generated with the same model and then utilize these rewrites in all stages of the retrieval pi peline. More speciﬁcally, generative neural approaches to CQR com- monly use the beam search algorithm [11]. According to this t ech- nique, the probability scores of the /u1D458most likely sequences are kept while generating a rewrite. When generation ﬁnishes, t he se- quence with the highest score is returned. 3.1.3 Conversational Multi-/Q_uery Rewriting. Motivated by the above, we propose conversational multi-query rewriting (CMQR), which uses a ﬁne-tuned generative language model to generate the top /u1D45Bquery rewrites at each turn /u1D456, ˆ/u1D45E1 /u1D456, ˆ/u1D45E2 /u1D456, . . . , ˆ/u1D45E/u1D45B /u1D456 , according to their beam search score. Each query rewrite ˆ/u1D45E/u1D457 /u1D456 has an associated rewrite score: /u1D445/u1D446 ( ˆ/u1D45E /u1D457 /u1D456) = /u1D443( ˆ/u1D45E /u1D457 /u1D456| /u1D43B) = /parenlefttpA /parenleftexA /parenleftexA /parenleftbtA | ˆ/u1D45E/u1D457 /u1D456|/productdisplay.1 /u1D459=1 /u1D443( /u1D461/u1D459| /u1D461/u1D459− 1, . . .
