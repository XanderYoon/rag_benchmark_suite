deep neural networks are used to generate query embeddings directly from context [21 , 22, 34]. These embeddings, used in conjunction with dense re - trieval, can handle intricate conversational contexts mor e eﬀec- tively. While they integrate seamlessly with advanced neural mod- els for IR, they require systems capable of interpreting the m, po- tentially demanding more computational resources or addit ional processing steps. In contrast, the traditional approach of QR oﬀers better interpretability and ﬂexibility, translating complex conversa- tional contexts into standalone, understandable queries that can be processed directly and eﬃciently with existing retrieval p ipelines. 3 METHOD This section presents our method for generating multiple qu ery rewrites in Section 3.1. The integration of those rewrites i n sparse and dense retrievals is described in Sections 3.2 and 3.3, re spec- tively. 3.1 Conversational Multi-Query Rewriting 3.1.1 Problem Statement. Conversational query rewriting (CQR) is the task of generating an informative context-independent query from a raw query (i.e., context-dependent user utterance) based on conversation context (i.e., history). Formally, we let /u1D45E/u1D456 be the raw query at conversation turn /u1D456, and /u1D43B= ⟨/u1D45E1, /u1D45F1, /u1D45E2, /u1D45F2, ..., /u1D45E /u1D456− 1, /u1D45F/u1D456− 1⟩ be the conversation history up to that point, where /u1D45F/u1D457 is a re- sponse provided by the system to the /u1D457th query ( /u1D457∈ [ 1../u1D456 − 1]) . A context-independent query ˆ /u1D45E/u1D456 is to created from the raw query /u1D45E/u1D456 by considering the conversation history up to that point: ˆ/u1D45E/u1D456 = /u1D45F/u1D452/u1D464/u1D45F/u1D456/u1D461/u1D452( ˆ/u1D45E1, /u1D45F1, ˆ/u1D45E2, /u1D45F2, . . . , ˆ/u1D45E/u1D456− 1, /u1D45F/u1D4561, /u1D45E/u1D456) . The rewritten query ˆ/u1D45E/u1D456 is considered self-contained and can be used downstream in v ari- ous components of the retrieval pipeline. 3.1.2 Motivation. The majority of recent approaches employ gen- erative neural models for CQR [15]. However, these models of
