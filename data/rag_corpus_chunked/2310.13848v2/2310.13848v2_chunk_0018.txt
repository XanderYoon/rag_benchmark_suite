are relevant to the input query event e, and should exclude non-event related details. Achiev- ing this criteria is not plausible by solely utilizing non- deterministic generative LLMs such as GPT-Neo, which are prone to output hallucinations [28]. We combat hallucinations and fulfill the above criteria by using a RAG-based approach by retrieving event narrative plot points stored in the EPG (Section IV-B) to control the prefix-tuned LLM generated output report. Our RAG approach is displayed in Figure V-A. To create a narrative prompt set for the intelligence analyst’s event query e, FABULA utilizes SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) templates. These queries can be executed on the EPG to retrieve a set of plot points related to event query e. For example, the SPARQL query to output the Lead narrative plot points for the event query e = "Oceangate" has been shown in Listing 1. FABULA includes a set of SPARQL query templates that can be leveraged to build a narrative prompt set for the intelligence analyst query e. This prompt set serves as the input to the prefix-tuned GPT-Neo that outputs the intelligence report Y . In the next section, we describe evaluation of the generated intelligence reports. Excerpts from an intelligence report generated by FABULA are available in Table V-C.
