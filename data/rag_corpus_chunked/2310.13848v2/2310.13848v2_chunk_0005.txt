event developments (Body), and the nonobligatory information at the end (Tail) [5]. B. Narrative Construction and Schemas Sequencing disparate events from a variety of sources is known as fragmented narrative construction [2]. While the disparate nature of OSINT provides opportunities for users to obtain insights, it presents challenges for chaining accurate data across noisy sources [6]. There have been several methods that address this problem. One is by sequencing causal and temporal event shifts into story chains. Zhu et al. [7] defines a story chain as “a construction of news articles that reveal hidden relationships among different events”. They utilize random walks on a bipartite graph to form a coherent story chain based on a query. Prior to this work, research projects have ordered news based on hierarchy [8], [9]. A novel method utilized in our FABULA system for extracting narratives is through the use of narrative schemas. Narrative schemas are models used to represent primary components of a narrative, such as actors, plot points, and actions [10]. C. Information Retrieval & Knowledge Representation Information Retrieval (IR) systems have evolved from symbolic-based methods [11] to neural retrieval models [12]. These capture semantic matches using neural networks to build vectorized knowledge representations. Representation tech- niques such as Knowledge Graphs (KG), have been popularly employed to support IR tasks [13]. D. Knowledge Graph (KG) to Text Generation The KG-to-text generation task is a form of semantic triple verbalization, which automatically generates descriptive text for a given KG [14], [15]. State of the art methods fine-tune text-to-text and generative decoder pre-trained models with KG-to-text datasets. One approach to this problem is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), a method that aims to seed external data is a technique that uses retrieved data that is stored externally (like in a KG) from the foundation model, which
