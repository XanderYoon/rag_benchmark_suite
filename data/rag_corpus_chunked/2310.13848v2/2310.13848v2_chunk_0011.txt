informa- tion that builds the main story objective and overall situational awareness of an event. FABULA’s NPCE utilizes a FAISS- based clustering [24] and regex approaches to extract Body category event information (Table I), which include evidences (pevidence), quotes (pquote), and media objects stored as URLs (pphoto, pvideo, paudio). 3) The Tail: The Tail category contains conclusive remarks, journalistic opinions ( popinion), persuasion tactics ( ptactic), and perceived sentiment ( psentiment) of the article author and source organization. These features do not contain plot points that impact the development of an event, but rather can be used by an analyst to understand factors that may influence the author’s narrative. Opinion (popinion) and persuasion tactic ( ptactic) identifica- tion is a multi-label task at the paragraph level. We utilize a gold standard model developed for the ACL Semantic Evalua- tion Task [25]. This was trained on the only publicly available human-labeled corpus specifically developed for persuasion language extraction [25]. We treat each article in our set D as a holdout sample and use the provided model to extract the persuasion tactics and the corresponding text sample. For sentiment detection, we utilize the spaCy sentiment analysis program polarity to extract positive, negative, and neutral sentiment for each article. The NPCE output of the 3-level Lead, Body, and Tail extraction populates the event plot points set P . We maintain the mapping between the extracted set P and the associated documents in set D for LLM prompt tuning, described further in Section V-C. In the next subsection, we describe methods we use to assert set P into FABULA’s Event Plot Graph (EPG). C. Event Narrative Ontology & Event Plot Graph We introduce the Event Narrative Ontology (ENO), a Web Ontology Language (OWL)-based knowledge representation. ENO allows FABULA to store event information based on
