generation. A. Narratives, Stories, & News OSINT about events, are published via blogs, social net- works, news sources. Events contain plot points , which are incidents that directly impact what happens next [1]. Events are communicated through the form of narratives which are accounts of interconnected plot points [2]. A seminal example of a narrative plot structure is the Plot Pyramid Model by Gustav Freytag, a five component framework that outlines thematic and temporal stages in generic storytelling [3]. The components are, Introduction, Rising Action, Climax, Falling Action, and Denouement . The plot points in the Freytag pyramid develop and conclude progressively over time, first leading to the development of the climax (introduction and rising action) and successively concluding to the denouement as a direct result of the climax (falling action). Unlike the pyramid, other narrative plot structures organize plot points in varying ways. For example, the Fichtean Curve , begins immediately with the rising action component, followed by a series of crisis (falling action) [4]. There are several more examples of other narrative plot structures such The Hero’s Journey that model the development of events differently [4]. Our system FABULA, focuses specifically on modeling the plot structure of open source news events . A narrative plot structure specifically developed for communicating news stories is the Inverted Plot Pyramid (IPP) (Figure 2). IPP is a three component model that conveys the critical plot points in the first component (Lead), the event developments (Body), and the nonobligatory information at the end (Tail) [5]. B. Narrative Construction and Schemas Sequencing disparate events from a variety of sources is known as fragmented narrative construction [2]. While the disparate nature of OSINT provides opportunities for users to obtain insights, it presents challenges for chaining accurate data across noisy sources [6]. There have been several
