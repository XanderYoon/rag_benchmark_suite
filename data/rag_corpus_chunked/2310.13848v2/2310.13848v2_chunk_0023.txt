tasked the analysts to recommend IPP plot points from each of the 5 events. We compute Cohen’s kappa [31] to measure inter- annotator agreement for each of the recommended IPP plot points, keeping only the plot points that scored higher than 0.6. This helped us derive a gold standard set of 78 plot points that analysts want in the generated report, referred to as set Gold. We then identify the number of IPP plot points in the FABULA’s generated reports for the 5 events. The number of IPP plot points in the generated reports overlapping with Gold is called support (denoted as #Supp). The number of missing plot points that were in Gold and not present in FABULA’s generated reports are called contradicting plot points (denoted as #Cont). The average scores are displayed in Table VI-B. These are computed against the Gold average of 15.6.

To score grammatical correctness and linguistic fluency, we adopt a 5-point Likert scale [32] ranging from 1-point (“Unac- ceptable”) to 5-point (“Very Acceptable”) tasking analysts to score the 5 FABULA generated reports. The Fluency column in Table VI-B reports averaged score (4.2/5) from 5 human analysts over the 5 generated reports. VII. C ONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK Deriving narratives about events using disparately sourced information is a challenging task for an intelligence analyst. Analysts heavily rely on traditional, manual techniques to parse large amounts of noisy OSINT data to create cohesive intelligence reports. These manual methods do not provide complete situational awareness and are prone to information gaps and inaccurate representations of dynamic events.In this paper, we have described our framework FABULA (Figure 1), that integrates real-time news event retrieval, narrative
