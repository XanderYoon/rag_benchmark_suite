D for LLM prompt tuning, described further in Section V-C. In the next subsection, we describe methods we use to assert set P into FABULA’s Event Plot Graph (EPG). C. Event Narrative Ontology & Event Plot Graph We introduce the Event Narrative Ontology (ENO), a Web Ontology Language (OWL)-based knowledge representation. ENO allows FABULA to store event information based on extracted plot point category features, described in the previous section. ENO serves as the base schema for FABULA’s Event Plot Graph (EPG). NPCE’s output, set P (Section IV-B) is asserted in the EPG using ENO. ENO classes and properties have been constructed using the elements of the Inverted Plot Pyramid (IPP) narrative scheme (Figure 2, Section II-A). While we incorporate the IPP scheme due to its relevance to intelligence analysis in particular, variants of ENO can be built based on a variety of narrative theories. The EPG contains a set of stored as Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples donated as G, G = {(s, p, o)|s, o ϵ I, p ϵ R} (1) where, I and R denote the instances and relations stored in G. (s, p, o) is a single triple in G and denotes the relation p between two entities s and o. Below is a description of ENO classes and properties. Classes in ENO: ENO contains a total of 16 classes and subclasses: two generic classes: N ewsArticle, P lotP oint, and 14 subclasses, all of which are of type owl : Class. The classes organize the information extracted in Section IV-B in a form that incorporates the IPP narrative scheme. Descriptions are as follows: • NewsArticle: Instances contain identifiers for news ar- ticles and metadata such as publisher, author, URL, etc. • PlotPoint: Describes IPP narrative elements (Section IV-B). It has following subclasses: 1) Lead: :
