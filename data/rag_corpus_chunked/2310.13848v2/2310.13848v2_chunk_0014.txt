author(s) of the article. • publishedBy: Data property denoting the publishing source of the NewsArticle instance. • publishedDate: Timestamp for N ewsArticle instance. • hasP lotP oint: This object property helps codify rela- tions between instances of the extracted IPP P lotP oint and its associated N ewsArticle. The property can be inherited by instances of P lotP oint subclasses. Fig. 3. Populated EPG Sub-graph for the 2023 Titan Submersible Implosion. For example, Figure 3, shows an EPG sub-graph about the 2023 Titan Submersible Implosion event. The graph represents one news article News937844. This sub-graph displays the Lead narrative plot points about a catastrophic implosion (pwhat), involving the U.S Coast Guard , OceanGate Expe- ditions, and Hamish Harding (pwho), occurring at the Titanic Wreck site, near Newfoundland, Canada (pwhere). Though not shown in this subgraph, we were able to extract Body and Tail narrative plot points, which were asserted in the EPG. These include Body instances: four pevidence pieces, two pquote and one pimage, and Tail instances: an attack on reputation ptactic and negative psentiment utilized by the article author James Bryan . The EPG G constructed from the news stream collection D is next utilized in automatic intelligence report generation. V. R ETRIEVAL -AUGMENTED INTELLIGENCE REPORT GENERATION An intelligence analyst can use FABULA to delineate event plot elements stored in the EPG G, for automatic generation of intelligence report Y about event e. FABULA implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach that queries the EPG to retrieve a narrative prompt set about event e (Figure V-A). The set serves as a prompt to a Large Language Model (LLM) during report generation. There are three pri- mary steps to our approach: (1) Fine-Tuning an LLM with D + IR, (2) Data-to-text prefix-tuning, and (3) SPARQL template LLM prompting for report generation.
