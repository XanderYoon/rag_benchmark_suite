Inspired by these recent developments, we develop FAB- ULA, a framework that integrates a novel RAG approach for using narrative plot structures, LLMs, and knowledge graphs to automatically generate intelligence reports (Figure 1). The main contributions of this paper include: • FABULA: A framework to augment intelligence analysis workflows. Analysts can use the system to automatically generate intelligence reports for events utilizing contex- tual narrative features found in OSINT (Section III). • Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach which retrieves plot points from a knowledge graph and provides them as input prompt sets for guided LLM intelligence report generation (Section V-C). II. R ELATED WORK In this section, we describe research on narratives, news event OSINT, knowledge representation, and data to text generation. A. Narratives, Stories, & News OSINT about events, are published via blogs, social net- works, news sources. Events contain plot points , which are incidents that directly impact what happens next [1]. Events are communicated through the form of narratives which are accounts of interconnected plot points [2]. A seminal example of a narrative plot structure is the Plot
