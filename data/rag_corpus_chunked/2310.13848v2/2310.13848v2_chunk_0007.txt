and representation of event concept information, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) of intelligence reports. Our approach is displayed in Figure 1. We begin by creating a news intelligence corpus from popular news sources and publicly available U.S Intelligence Community (IC) reports, described in Section IV-A. This corpus is further condensed through information extraction of plot points contained within news articles and follows the Inverted Plot Pyramid (IPP) narrative structure (Section IV-B). The extracted plot points are then asserted into an Event Plot Graph (EPG) using our base Event Narrative Ontology (ENO) schema (Section IV-C). Next, we fine-tune the LLM, GPT-Neo [16] using our news intelligence corpus and the extracted plot points V-A). FABULA’s EPG is queried using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to control GPT-Neo’s intelligence report generation process. Fig. 2. The Inverted Pyramid Plot (IPP) model and associated text features. IV. E VENT INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION AND REPRESENTATION In this section we describe methods for collecting open source news event data and organizing it in a knowledge representation based on the Inverted Pyramid Plot (IPP) news narrative model features. A. News Intelligence Corpus The first component of FABULA is a news intelligence corpus which contains streams of scraped public news articles, D and open source intelligence reports IR released by the U.S government. FABULA utilizes Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed triggers for sources such as CNN [17], New York Times [18], CBS News [19], U.S. Department of State [20], and U.S. Department of Defense [21]. Each feed contains article metadata such as headline, author(s), abstract, and a web link. When updates are pushed by sources on their RSS feeds, FABULA utilizes the RSS web links to retrieve the corresponding webpages. We further extract information such as timestamps, news text, image links, video links from each article, using the BeautifulSoup web parser 1.
