2023 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM) FABULA: Intelligence Report Generation Using Retrieval-Augmented Narrative Construction Priyanka Ranade Department of CSEE University of Maryland, Baltimore County Baltimore, MD, USA priyankaranade@umbc.edu Anupam Joshi Department of CSEE University of Maryland, Baltimore County Baltimore, MD, USA joshi@umbc.edu Abstract—Narrative construction is the process of representing disparate event information into a logical plot structure that models an end to end story. Intelligence analysis is an example of a domain that can benefit tremendously from narrative construc- tion techniques, particularly in aiding analysts during the largely manual and costly process of synthesizing event information into comprehensive intelligence reports. Manual intelligence report generation is often prone to challenges such as integrating dynamic event information, writing fine-grained queries, and closing information gaps. This motivates the development of a system that retrieves and represents critical aspects of events in a form that aids in automatic generation of intelligence reports. We introduce a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) ap- proach to augment prompting of an autoregressive decoder by retrieving structured information asserted in a knowledge graph to generate targeted information based on a narrative plot model. We apply our approach to the problem of neural intelligence report generation and introduce FABULA, framework to aug- ment intelligence analysis workflows using RAG. An analyst can use FABULA to query an Event Plot Graph (EPG) to retrieve relevant event plot points, which can be used to augment prompting of a Large Language Model (LLM) during intelligence report generation. Our evaluation studies show that the plot points included in the generated intelligence reports have high semantic relevance, high coherency, and low data redundancy.
