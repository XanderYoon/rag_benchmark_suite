analysis domain can bene- fit tremendously from techniques in computational narrative construction, which utilize existing Information Retrieval (IR) methods such as document collection, query processing, and ranking to aid end users in comprehending disparate event information. Specifically, integrating narrative construction tasks to intelligence analysis workflows can alleviate the costly nature of intelligence report generation in three primary ways: (a) Automatically extracting event information from a dense collection of documents based on a schema, (b) Aiding in information triage during intelligence report generation, (c) Tracking and integrating evolving event information over time. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled state of the art results in automatic text genera- tion tasks, presenting new opportunities in the computational narrative construction domain. For example, an end user can issue directed prompts to a generative LLM to automatically generate summaries that communicate end to end narratives about an event. Similarly, we envision that an intelligence analyst can prompt an LLM to automatically generate accu- rate intelligence reports about queried events. Despite these potential benefits, a direct application of LLMs for automatic intelligence report generation presents several limitations, such as: (a) Output hallucinations where the generated text contains non-factual, non-event related, and incomplete information, (b) Lack of provenance, attribution, and trust for knowledge sources used to generate responses. The AI community has started to address these challenges through a general approach called Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) which uses Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.
