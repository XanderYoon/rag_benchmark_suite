of Defense [21]. Each feed contains article metadata such as headline, author(s), abstract, and a web link. When updates are pushed by sources on their RSS feeds, FABULA utilizes the RSS web links to retrieve the corresponding webpages. We further extract information such as timestamps, news text, image links, video links from each article, using the BeautifulSoup web parser 1. Each individual news article is represented in the collection of OSINT news set D. D = {d1, d2, ..., dk, ..., dn} Each dk represents a news article and its headlines, au- thor(s), timestamps, text, images, video links. Set IR is composed of publicly available intelligence re- ports released by the United States Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) 2. The ODNI intelligence reports (2005-2023) have a common structure that matches the Inverted Plot Pyramid narrative scheme (Section IV-B). Our final news intelligence corpus D + IR, contains to 3000 D news articles and 165 IR reports. B. Event Plot Extraction FABULA solves a fragmented narrative construction prob- lem where given a set of relevant articles retrieved by a search query about event e, contain several plot points: P = {p1, p2, ..., pi, ..., po} Where, pi is a plot point that is extracted from D. The associated plot points for an event e, can be determined through information extraction based on classes in the In- verted Plot Pyramid (IPP) (Figure 2), a standardized narrative structure for communicating news events (Section II-A). The IPP narrative structure has three sub-categories: Lead, Body, and Tail. Definitions of the IPP sub-categories and associated sub-types are available in Table I. To extract the IPP-based plot points, we implement a Narrative Plot Concept Extractor (NPCE) that processes the set of news articles D. In the rest of this section, we further describe
