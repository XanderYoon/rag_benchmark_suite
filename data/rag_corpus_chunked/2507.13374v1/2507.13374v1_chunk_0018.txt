appears as subtitles versus text that exists independently on screen. This ambiguity reflects real-world complexity in video content where modalities often overlap or convey re- dundant information. Domain Generalization: Our evaluation focuses on a spe- cific video dataset with particular content characteristics. The routing patterns observed may not generalize to do- mains with different query distributions or content types. Educational videos, for instance, might require different routing strategies than entertainment content due to varied information density across modalities. LLM Dependency: The system’s reliance on LLM-based routing introduces potential bottlenecks and cost consid- erations for large-scale deployment. While our evaluation uses GPT-4.1, practical implementations might require spe- cialized fine-tuned models or local deployment strategies to manage latency and cost constraints. Scalability Considerations: As the number of available modalities grows (incorporating audio features, object de- tection, facial recognition, etc.), the routing decision space becomes increasingly complex. Future work should ex- plore whether LLM-based approaches can scale to handle larger modality sets or whether alternative approaches be- come necessary. 8. Conclusion ModaRoute demonstrates that LLM-based query routing can significantly reduce computational costs in multimodal video retrieval while maintaining competitive performance, making large-scale multimodal search practical for real- world deployment. By leveraging LLM-based intent anal- ysis, our system achieves a 41% reduction in computa- tional overhead compared to exhaustive search, averaging 1.78 modalities per query versus the baseline 3.0. For plat- forms processing millions of queries daily, this efficiency improvement translates to substantial infrastructure cost savings while preserving retrieval effectiveness—reducing computational requirements from 3.0x to 1.78x per query. u78i Our comprehensive evaluation on 1.8M video clips shows that the 86.5% routing accuracy translates to prac- tical efficiency gains without sacrificing retrieval qual- ity. ModaRoute achieves 40.5% Recall@1 and 60.9% Re- call@5, substantially outperforming naive late fusion ap- proaches while approaching the performance of computa-
