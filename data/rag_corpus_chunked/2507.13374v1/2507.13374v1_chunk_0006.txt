standardized for resolution and aspect ratio. All embeddings are L2-normalized before indexing to en- able consistent cosine similarity computation. System Architecture: The complete routing pipeline pro- cesses queries through several stages: (1) LLM-based intent analysis and modality selection, (2) parallel index queries for selected modalities, (3) rank fusion of results, and (4) fi- nal ranking with modality provenance tracking. Each com- ponent is designed for modularity, enabling easy substitu- tion of routing models or fusion strategies. 3.3. Result Fusion and Ranking When multiple modalities are selected, ModaRoute em- ploys rank-based fusion to combine results. This lightweight approach avoids the computational overhead of learned fusion while maintaining effectiveness across di- verse query types. Our fusion strategy uses rank-based scoring where each modality contributes points inversely proportional to rank position. For k selected modalities returning top-n results each, the fused score for item i is computed as: score(i) = kX j=1 (n − rankj(i)) (1) where rankj(i) is the rank of item i in modality j’s result list, and items not appearing in a list receive zero contribution. This approach naturally emphasizes highly- ranked items while allowing lower-ranked items from mul- tiple modalities to accumulate sufficient score for inclusion in final results. Linear fusion was selected over RRF for its comparable accuracy and lower computational overhead. Results are re-ranked by fused scores and returned to the user with modality provenance information for explainabil- ity. 4. Experimental Setup 4.1. Dataset Composition We evaluate on a 1.8M-clip subset from a large-scale multi- modal video dataset with comprehensive annotations. This represents one of the largest multimodal retrieval evaluation benchmarks to date, spanning 29,259 source videos across diverse content categories. The complete dataset descrip- tion and additional benchmark tasks will be detailed in con- current work [4]; here we focus on the multimodal retrieval evaluation that
