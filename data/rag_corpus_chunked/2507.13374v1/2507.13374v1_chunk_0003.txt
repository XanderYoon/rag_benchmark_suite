work bridges this gap by demonstrating how linguistic analysis can predict modality relevance for video search tasks. 2.3. Efficiency in Retrieval Systems Efficiency optimization in information retrieval spans mul- tiple dimensions, including index compression [14], query optimization [12], and selective search strategies [2]. Re- cent work has explored neural approaches to efficiency op- timization, including learned sparse representations [5] and adaptive retrieval strategies [7]. Our approach contributes to this line of work by in- troducing LLM-based routing as a novel efficiency opti- mization technique specifically designed for multimodal re- trieval scenarios. However, no prior work has addressed the fundamen- tal efficiency versus accuracy trade-off in multimodal video retrieval through intelligent query routing. While exist- ing multimodal systems achieve strong performance, they require querying all modality indices for every request, leading to 3x computational overhead compared to single- modality approaches. Our work fills this gap by demon- strating that LLM-based intent analysis can predict modal- ity relevance with sufficient accuracy to enable practical ef- ficiency gains. 3. LLM-Based Multimodal Routing ModaRoute addresses the efficiency challenge in multi- modal video retrieval through intelligent query routing. Rather than exhaustively searching all modality indices, our system uses an LLM to predict which modalities are most likely to contain relevant information for a given query, then searches only those selected indices. Figure 1 illustrates the complete system architecture. The process begins with natural language queries that are analyzed by an LLM router to determine modality rele- vance. Selected modalities are queried in parallel, and re- sults are combined through rank-based fusion to produce the final ranking. Figure 1.

For the query “What does the chef say about sea- soning?”, the router correctly identifies speech content and routes only to the ASR index, avoiding unnecessary searches of OCR and
