models frequently describe visible text as part of visual scene de- scriptions. This creates cases where OCR content appears in multiple modality descriptions, complicating routing decisions. Future work will explore targeted fine-tuning to reduce OCR modality confusion. Representative Failure Examples: • Query: “2020 election protest sign ‘Was the 2020 Elec- tion Stolen?”’ Ground Truth: OCR (visible sign text) Router Decision: [“asr”, “visuals”] Issue: Router missed explicit text-reading intent • Query: “Read the subtitle text that appears at 00:12” Ground Truth: OCR (subtitle display) Router Decision: {“ocr”: “subtitle text at 00:12”} Result: Correct routing (successful case) Conservative Routing Trade-offs:The system’s conserva- tive approach (averaging 1.78 modalities per query) reduces false negatives at the cost of computational efficiency. Anal- ysis shows that 14% of queries trigger exhaustive search primarily due to: 1. Ambiguous Intent: Queries that could reasonably apply to multiple modalities 2. Complex Information Needs: Multi-step queries re- quiring cross-modal reasoning 3. Low Confidence Decisions: Cases where the LLM ex- presses uncertainty about optimal routing 7 Despite these challenges, the 86.5% hit rate for including correct modalities demonstrates the overall effectiveness of LLM-based routing for multimodal retrieval tasks. 7. Discussion and Limitations Our evaluation demonstrates that LLM-based query routing can achieve substantial efficiency improvements in multi- modal video retrieval while maintaining competitive perfor- mance. However, several limitations merit discussion. Routing Accuracy Challenges: The 42.9% accuracy for OCR routing in single-modality mode highlights a funda- mental challenge: distinguishing between spoken content that appears as subtitles versus text that exists independently on screen. This ambiguity reflects real-world complexity in video content where modalities often overlap or convey re- dundant information. Domain Generalization: Our evaluation focuses on a spe- cific video dataset with particular content characteristics. The routing patterns observed may not generalize to do- mains with different query distributions or content types. Educational
