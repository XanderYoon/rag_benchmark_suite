Enter- tainment content shows moderate performance with higher routing diversity (1.88 average modalities), reflecting the varied nature of entertainment-related information needs. 5.5. Routing Behavior Analysis Analysis of routing decisions reveals systematic patterns that validate our approach while highlighting areas for im- provement. When configured to select only a single modal- ity per query (for analysis purposes), the router demon- strates clear understanding of modality-specific cues but shows predictable confusion patterns. Single-Modality Routing Accuracy: To understand rout- ing precision, we evaluated the system’s ability to select the correct source modality when constrained to single- modality routing. The confusion matrix reveals: The router excels at identifying visual queries (99.4% accuracy) and performs reasonably well on ASR queries (71.7% accuracy). However, OCR queries present the great- est challenge (42.9% accuracy), with frequent confusion be- 6 Table 5.

Multi-Modal Routing Performance: In the full multi- modal routing mode, the system achieves 86.5% accuracy in including the ground-truth modality among its predictions, averaging 1.78 modalities per query. Detailed performance metrics show: • Top-1 hit rate: 86.5% (1899/2195 queries include cor- rect modality) • Mean predicted modalities: 1.78 per query • Micro-averaged F1: 43.9% • Coverage error: 2.68 (average labels needed
