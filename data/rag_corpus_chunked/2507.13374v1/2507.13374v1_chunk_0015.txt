Routing Performance: In the full multi- modal routing mode, the system achieves 86.5% accuracy in including the ground-truth modality among its predictions, averaging 1.78 modalities per query. Detailed performance metrics show: • Top-1 hit rate: 86.5% (1899/2195 queries include cor- rect modality) • Mean predicted modalities: 1.78 per query • Micro-averaged F1: 43.9% • Coverage error: 2.68 (average labels needed to cover ground truth) Common Confusion Patterns: Analysis reveals two pri- mary sources of OCR routing errors: 1. Subtitle Overlap: OCR text often contains literal speech subtitles, creating ambiguity between ASR and OCR modalities 2. Visual Description Overlap: Vision-language models sometimes describe visible text in visual captions, blur- ring boundaries between OCR and visual modalities The majority of routing failures involve not selecting OCR when needed, indicating conservative bias in the LLM’s text detection capabilities. 5.6. Router Design Analysis The routing system’s conservative approach, averaging 1.78 modalities per query, reflects a design choice that priori- tizes recall over computational efficiency. This strategy re- duces the risk of missing relevant content by including mul- tiple modalities when uncertainty exists, though it sacrifices some potential efficiency gains. Analysis of routing patterns shows that the system suc- cessfully identifies clear-cut cases (single modality selec- tion for 36% of queries) while falling back to broader search for ambiguous cases. This adaptive behavior demonstrates the LLM’s ability to assess confidence levels and make ap- propriate trade-offs between precision and recall. Computational Cost Breakdown: The system’s primary efficiency gain comes from reducing the number of index searches required per query. While the LLM routing call introduces some overhead, the overall computational sav- ings of 41% demonstrate the practical value of intelligent modality selection. The reduction from 3.0 to 1.78 average modalities per query represents substantial resource savings in large-scale deployment scenarios. 6. Error Analysis and Failure
