primary efficiency gain comes from reducing the number of index searches required per query. While the LLM routing call introduces some overhead, the overall computational sav- ings of 41% demonstrate the practical value of intelligent modality selection. The reduction from 3.0 to 1.78 average modalities per query represents substantial resource savings in large-scale deployment scenarios. 6. Error Analysis and Failure Cases Detailed analysis of routing failures provides insights into system limitations and opportunities for improvement. The primary failure modes stem from inherent ambiguities in multimodal content and conservative routing strategies. Quantified Impact of Routing Failures: Analysis of fail- ure modes reveals that routing errors have limited impact on overall system performance. OCR routing failures, while frequent (42.9% accuracy in single-modality mode), affect only 23% of queries and reduce overall Recall@5 by just 3.2 percentage points. This suggests that the system’s con- servative routing strategy effectively mitigates the impact of individual routing errors. Simple keyword-based improve- ments (detecting terms like “read”, “sign”, “text”) could im- prove OCR routing accuracy by an estimated 23%, repre- senting a clear path for future enhancement. OCR Detection Challenges: The most significant routing challenge involves OCR content detection. Two systematic patterns emerge: • Subtitle Confusion: Many videos contain speech subti- tles rendered as on-screen text. Queries referencing this content create ambiguity—is the user asking about what was spoken or what text appears on screen? The router often defaults to ASR interpretation. • Visual-OCR Overlap: Modern vision-language models frequently describe visible text as part of visual scene de- scriptions. This creates cases where OCR content appears in multiple modality descriptions, complicating routing decisions. Future work will explore targeted fine-tuning to reduce OCR modality confusion. Representative Failure Examples: • Query: “2020 election protest sign ‘Was the 2020 Elec- tion Stolen?”’ Ground Truth: OCR (visible sign text) Router Decision:
