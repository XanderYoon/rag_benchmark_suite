∧|tj − tgold| ≤ 10s 0.0 otherwise (2) where cj is a candidate clip, gold(qi) is the ground truth clip for query qi, and tj, tgold are temporal positions. NDCG is then computed as: NDCG@k = DCG@k IDCG@k = Pk i=1 2reli −1 log2(i+1) Pk i=1 2rel∗ i −1 log2(i+1) (3) where rel∗ i represents the ideal relevance ordering with relevance scores [1.0, 0.5, 0, 0, ...]. Computational efficiency is measured by average modal- ities queried per request, with cost savings calculated rela- tive to exhaustive search across all three modalities. 5. Experimental Results We evaluate ModaRoute on a comprehensive benchmark of 2,195 multimodal video retrieval queries, comparing against exhaustive search baselines and single-modality ap- proaches. Our evaluation demonstrates that intelligent rout- ing achieves strong performance while providing substan- tial efficiency gains. 5.1. Overall Performance Analysis ModaRoute achieves near-optimal retrieval performance while reducing computational cost by 41%, demonstrating that intelligent routing provides a practical solution to the efficiency-accuracy trade-off in multimodal video retrieval. Figure 3 presents the comprehensive performance compari- son across different retrieval approaches. Our intelligent routing strategy achieves 40.5% Re- call@1 and 60.9% Recall@5 while querying an average of only 1.78 modalities per request. This represents sub- stantial efficiency gains—reducing computational overhead from 3.0 to 1.78 modalities (41% reduction) while main- taining performance within 15 percentage points of the text- only upper bound. The results demonstrate that routing ac- curacy of 86.5% translates directly to practical efficiency benefits without sacrificing retrieval effectiveness. The 15-point R@5 gap versus All-Text reflects the fundamen- tal efficiency-accuracy trade-off: All-Text requires expen- sive dense captioning with offline processing unavailable at query time, while ModaRoute operates on lightweight ASR/OCR indices suitable for real-time deployment. This gap represents the cost of practical scalability. The efficiency improvement can be quantified as: Cost Reduction = 1−avg modalities
