analysis of real query patterns reveals that most information needs tar- get only 1-2 modalities, suggesting substantial optimization opportunities through intelligent routing. Recent advances in vision-language models enable rich textual descriptions of multimodal content, but critical lim- itations remain: (1) scene text is often missed or inaccu- rately described in visual captions, (2) generating compre- hensive dense captions requires expensive offline process- ing that may not scale to real-time content, and (3) speech nuances like speaker identity and temporal alignment are lost in text summarization. Moreover, this represents the first application of LLM-based routing to video retrieval, extending beyond prior work on web passages. We introduce ModaRoute, the first system to use large language models for intelligent modality routing in video retrieval. By analyzing the linguistic structure and semantic content of natural language queries, our LLM-based router predicts which modalities are most likely to contain rele- vant information, then searches only those selected indices. This approach maintains retrieval quality competitive with exhaustive search while providing substantial efficiency im- provements through selective querying, making multimodal video retrieval practical for large-scale deployment. Our contributions include: (1) The first LLM-based rout- ing system for large-scale video retrieval, achieving 86.5% modality selection accuracy on 1.8M clips, (2) 41% com- putational reduction while maintaining competitive perfor- mance, and (3) systematic analysis revealing OCR detection as the primary routing challenge. While demonstrated on three core modalities, this rout- ing approach becomes increasingly valuable as multimodal systems expand to include domain-specific embeddings (medical imaging, satellite data), fine-grained audio anal- ysis (music, sound effects, speaker identification), or spe- cialized visual features (object detection, facial recogni- tion). The computational savings scale superlinearly with modality count—systems with 10+ modalities would see even greater efficiency gains from intelligent routing versus exhaustive search. 2.
