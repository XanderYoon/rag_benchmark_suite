the visual modality or where vi- sual understanding itself proves challenging. Interestingly, OCR-derived queries show a moderate per- formance gap, suggesting opportunities for improving text detection and routing accuracy. This pattern indicates that while the system successfully handles speech-focused con- tent, visual and text modalities present ongoing challenges for both routing accuracy and retrieval effectiveness. 5.4. Performance Across Content Categories We analyze system performance across different video con- tent categories to understand domain-specific routing pat- terns: Content category analysis reveals interesting patterns in routing behavior and effectiveness. News & Politics con- tent shows the strongest ModaRoute performance (70.6% vs 78.3% for All-Text), likely due to clear linguistic pat- terns in news-related queries that facilitate accurate routing decisions. Educational content presents the largest performance gap, suggesting that educational queries may involve more complex multimodal reasoning that challenges both routing 5 Figure 3. Performance comparison across retrieval methods. ModaRoute (blue) achieves 40.5% R@1 and 60.9% R@5 while averaging only 1.78 modalities per query, substantially outperforming Late Fusion of all modalities (orange) and single-modality approaches (yel- low/purple). The All-Text baseline (green) represents the theoretical upper bound using comprehensive text descriptions. Table 2. Detailed Performance Metrics Method R@1 R@5 R@10 MRR NDCG@5 Avg Mod.
