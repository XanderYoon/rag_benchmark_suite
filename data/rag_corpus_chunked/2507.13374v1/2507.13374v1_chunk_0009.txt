windows that let in plenty of light.” Multimodal Coverage Statistics: • Speech Coverage: 87% of clips contain meaningful speech content with ASR transcripts • Scene Text Coverage: 34% of clips contain extractable text through OCR processing • Visual Coverage: 100% of clips have automatically gen- erated visual captions • Query Annotations: 2,195 hand-annotated retrieval queries with ground-truth relevance judgments 4.2. Baseline Justification and Upper Bound Anal- ysis To establish meaningful baselines, we compare against both single-modality approaches and a text-only upper bound that represents optimal retrieval when multimodal content is perfectly captured in text form. Our “All-Text” base- line searches comprehensive textual descriptions that com- bine information from all modalities—merging speech tran- scripts, scene text, and visual captions into unified repre- sentations—establishing an upper bound on performance achievable through text-only search. This comparison is motivated by recent advances in vision-language models that can generate rich textual de- scriptions of multimodal content. Table 1 demonstrates that text-based approaches can be highly competitive with end- to-end multimodal methods. Table 1.

Query Construction and Annotation Our evaluation queries are derived from the dataset content to ensure known ground-truth relevance while maintaining realistic query characteristics. Each query is annotated with its source modality to enable fine-grained analysis of rout- ing performance. Queries are systematically generated from different modality sources and manually validated for relevance and clarity. The annotation process labels each query with the modality that contains the relevant information: • ASR-derived: Queries targeting spoken content (e.g., “Who says ’I’m not going
