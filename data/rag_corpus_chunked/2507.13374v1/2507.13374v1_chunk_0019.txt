cost savings while preserving retrieval effectiveness—reducing computational requirements from 3.0x to 1.78x per query. u78i Our comprehensive evaluation on 1.8M video clips shows that the 86.5% routing accuracy translates to prac- tical efficiency gains without sacrificing retrieval qual- ity. ModaRoute achieves 40.5% Recall@1 and 60.9% Re- call@5, substantially outperforming naive late fusion ap- proaches while approaching the performance of computa- tionally expensive exhaustive methods. The analysis reveals clear patterns in routing behavior: the system excels at identifying visual queries (99.4% ac- curacy) and speech queries (71.7% accuracy), while OCR detection remains challenging (42.9% accuracy) due to in- herent ambiguities between spoken subtitles and indepen- dent text content. These findings provide valuable insights for future multimodal system design. Future Research Directions: • Joint Routing and Query Optimization: Our current system generates optimized queries per modality but fo- cuses evaluation on routing decisions. Future work could explore fine-tuned models that simultaneously route and reformulate queries for optimal retrieval performance. • Adaptive Routing: Learning from user feedback and re- trieval success patterns to improve routing decisions over time • OCR-Specific Improvements: Developing specialized techniques to better distinguish between subtitle text, scene text, and visual descriptions of text • Multi-step Retrieval: Sequential modality exploration for complex information needs that may require iterative refinement • Domain Specialization: Customized routing strategies for specific content types (educational, news, entertain- ment) based on observed category-specific patterns • Real-time Optimization: Balancing routing accuracy with latency constraints for interactive applications The practical efficiency gains demonstrated by ModaRoute make it a viable approach for real-world deployment, particularly in scenarios where computational resources are constrained or where query volumes demand efficient processing strategies. As multimodal content con- tinues to grow and diversify, intelligent routing represents a promising direction for scalable retrieval system design. References [1] Andrei Broder.
