without sacrificing retrieval effectiveness. The 15-point R@5 gap versus All-Text reflects the fundamen- tal efficiency-accuracy trade-off: All-Text requires expen- sive dense captioning with offline processing unavailable at query time, while ModaRoute operates on lightweight ASR/OCR indices suitable for real-time deployment. This gap represents the cost of practical scalability. The efficiency improvement can be quantified as: Cost Reduction = 1−avg modalities queried 3 = 1− 1.78 3 = 41% (4) Notably, our routing approach achieves 62.4% R@1 on ASR-derived queries (matching dense text performance) while using only 1.78 modalities, demonstrating that intel- ligent routing can approach exhaustive search effectiveness where query intent is clear. The results demonstrate that ModaRoute’s intelligent routing strategy achieves 40.5% Recall@1 and 60.9% Re- call@5 while querying an average of only 1.78 modalities per request. This represents a 41% reduction in computa- tional cost compared to exhaustive search (3.0 modalities) while maintaining substantially higher performance than naive fusion approaches. 5.2. Detailed Performance Metrics For comprehensive evaluation, Table 2 provides detailed metrics across all methods, including NDCG scores that ac- count for graded relevance in video retrieval scenarios. 5.3. Performance by Query Source Modality Breaking down results by the modality that generated each query provides insights into where intelligent routing pro- vides the most value: The results show that ModaRoute performs optimally on ASR-derived queries, matching the all-text performance while using fewer resources. Performance gaps are most pronounced for visual-derived queries, where the router sometimes fails to select the visual modality or where vi- sual understanding itself proves challenging. Interestingly, OCR-derived queries show a moderate per- formance gap, suggesting opportunities for improving text detection and routing accuracy. This pattern indicates that while the system successfully handles speech-focused con- tent, visual and text modalities present ongoing challenges for both routing accuracy and retrieval effectiveness. 5.4.
