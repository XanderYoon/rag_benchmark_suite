The practical efficiency gains demonstrated by ModaRoute make it a viable approach for real-world deployment, particularly in scenarios where computational resources are constrained or where query volumes demand efficient processing strategies. As multimodal content con- tinues to grow and diversify, intelligent routing represents a promising direction for scalable retrieval system design. References [1] Andrei Broder.
