expand to include domain-specific embeddings (medical imaging, satellite data), fine-grained audio anal- ysis (music, sound effects, speaker identification), or spe- cialized visual features (object detection, facial recogni- tion). The computational savings scale superlinearly with modality count—systems with 10+ modalities would see even greater efficiency gains from intelligent routing versus exhaustive search. 2. Related Work 2.1. Multimodal Video Retrieval Video retrieval has evolved from simple metadata-based search to sophisticated multimodal understanding systems. Early approaches focused primarily on visual content anal- ysis [11], while recent advances incorporate speech recog- 1 arXiv:2507.13374v1 [cs.CV] 12 Jul 2025 nition, text extraction, and semantic understanding across modalities [3, 8]. Current state-of-the-art systems typically employ dense fusion strategies that combine embeddings from multiple modalities [6]. While effective for retrieval quality, these approaches require processing all available modalities for every query, leading to computational bottlenecks in large- scale deployments. While end-to-end video embedding models (Video- CLIP [13], Video-ChatGPT [9]) offer semantic richness, text-based indexing provides scalable, interpretable re- trieval suitable for production deployment. Our approach bridges the efficiency of text search with multimodal cov- erage, avoiding the computational overhead of dense video feature extraction while maintaining access to speech, vi- sual, and textual content through lightweight text indices. 2.2. Query Intent Understanding Understanding user intent from natural language queries has been extensively studied in web search and information retrieval contexts [1, 10]. However, the application of intent understanding to modality selection in multimodal retrieval remains largely unexplored. Our work bridges this gap by demonstrating how linguistic analysis can predict modality relevance for video search tasks. 2.3. Efficiency in Retrieval Systems Efficiency optimization in information retrieval spans mul- tiple dimensions, including index compression [14], query optimization [12], and selective search strategies [2]. Re- cent work has explored neural approaches to efficiency op- timization, including learned sparse representations [5] and
