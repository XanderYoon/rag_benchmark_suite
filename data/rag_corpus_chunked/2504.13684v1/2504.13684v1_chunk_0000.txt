Intelligent Interaction Strategies for Context-Aware Cognitive Augmentation XIANGRONG (DANIEL) ZHU, YUAN XU, and TIANJIAN LIU, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), China JINGWEI SUN and YU ZHANG, Lenovo Research, China XIN TONG†, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) and The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China Human cognition is constrained by processing limitations, leading to cognitive overload and inefficiencies in knowledge synthesis and decision-making. Large Language Models (LLMs) present an opportunity for cognitive augmentation, but their current reactive nature limits their real-world applicability. This position paper explores the potential of context-aware cognitive augmentation, where LLMs dynamically adapt to users’ cognitive states and task environments to provide appropriate support. Through a think-aloud study in an exhibition setting, we examine how individuals interact with multi-modal information and identify key cognitive challenges in structuring, retrieving, and applying knowledge. Our findings highlight the need for AI-driven cognitive support systems that integrate real-time contextual awareness, personalized reasoning assistance, and socially adaptive interactions. We propose a framework for AI augmentation that seamlessly transitions between real-time cognitive support and post-experience knowledge organization, contributing to the design of more effective human-centered AI systems.

While sensory systems acquire information at approximately 109 bits per second, cognitive processing operates at only about 10 bits per second [18]. This bottleneck limits individuals’ ability to synthesize, connect, and apply knowledge efficiently, often leading to cognitive overload and decision-making
