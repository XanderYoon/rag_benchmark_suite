The exhibition setting also introduced cognitive load challenges, requiring participants to selectively focus on key information while filtering distractions. AI tools need to track users’ cognitive states and provide timely, relevant support, such as summarizing dense content or reinforcing key insights. 3.2.3 Participants’ Expectations for Adaptive AI Support. Participants identified two key areas where AI could improve their experience: (1) real-time comprehension support and (2) post-visit knowledge organization. They needed AI systems to help process and contextualize information as they explored, rather than requiring them to manually curate their knowledge afterward. They also expected AI to assist in aggregating, organizing, and structuring recorded content for later reference. Participants demonstrated different cognitive workflows for structuring information. A participant constructed broad conceptual frameworks before revisiting specific details. Two others adopted a detail-oriented approach, capturing comprehensive information first before synthesizing key insights. These differences showed that rigid, one-size-fits-all AI models failed to support diverse cognitive needs. AI-driven augmentation need to recognize user-specific cognitive patterns and dynamically adjust interventions—whether by prompting reflective questions, restructuring information hierarchically, or offering personalized synthesis tools. Manuscript submitted to ACM 6 Zhu et al. 3.3 Implications for Context-Aware Cognitive Augmentation Participants’ behaviors suggest the potential benefits of multi-modal, context-sensitive, and adaptive AI systems in supporting human cognition. Existing AI models primarily rely on reactive interactions, requiring users to explicitly request information [14]. However, our findings indicate that AI systems could be more effective if theyadapted to users’ cognitive states and environments to provide more relevant support. Based on these observations, we outline key considerations for designing AI-driven cognitive augmentation systems: • Multi-modal Awareness: AI could integrate text, images, movement patterns, and behavioral cues to enhance contextualized knowledge augmentation. • Cognitive Workflow Adaptation: AI might benefit from recognizing whether a user is engaging in exploratory or structured information processing and
