By integrating multi-modal signals and real-time context, LLMs can move beyond passive knowledge retrieval to actively supporting human cognition in complex, information-rich settings. Human cognition follows a structured process that filters, interprets, and applies information [8]. Perception channels sensory inputs (e.g., vision, audition, touch), but selective attention limits what enters cognitive processing. Cognitive mechanisms then organize and integrate the selected information, constrained by working memory capacity and processing bandwidth [11]. Finally, individuals apply processed knowledge in real-world tasks, yet memory retrieval often suffers from decay and reconstruction, affecting accuracy and efficiency [13]. Understanding these limitations is critical for designing AI-driven cognitive support systems that enhance human reasoning. However, supporting human cognition effectively requires more than just providing access to vast amounts of information. The ability to filter, contextualize, and apply relevant knowledge in real time is crucial for mitigating cognitive constraints. Despite their potential, existing LLMs lack contextual awareness, providing one-size-fits-all responses rather than adapting to users’ cognitive processes [2]. Effective augmentation requires LLMs to be proactive, leveraging real-time contextual information to tailor responses and facilitate structured reasoning. Our preliminary study tends to investigate two research questions: • How do individuals sense, process, and apply information in real-world tasks, and what cognitive support do they expect? • How should AI-driven cognitive support systems be designed to enhance knowledge augmentation? To explore these questions,
