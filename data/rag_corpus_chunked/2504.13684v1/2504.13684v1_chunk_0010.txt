and environments to provide more relevant support. Based on these observations, we outline key considerations for designing AI-driven cognitive augmentation systems: • Multi-modal Awareness: AI could integrate text, images, movement patterns, and behavioral cues to enhance contextualized knowledge augmentation. • Cognitive Workflow Adaptation: AI might benefit from recognizing whether a user is engaging in exploratory or structured information processing and adjusting its interventions accordingly. • Socially Adaptive Interaction: AI should consider offering discreet, unobtrusive engagement methods that respect social constraints while assisting cognition. • Seamless Transition Between Real-Time and Long-Term Support: AI could function both as a real-time cognitive assistant and a post-experience knowledge synthesizer. 4 Conclusion Our study highlights the critical need for AI systems that go beyond static, prompt-driven interactions to proactively assist users in sensing, processing, and utilizing information in real-world tasks by adapting to cognitive constraints and integrating seamlessly into daily workflows. By examining how individuals engage with information in real- world settings, we identified key challenges in context-aware knowledge capture, information organization, and adaptive cognitive support. Our findings reinforce that effective AI-driven cognitive augmentation must be multi-modal, personalized, and socially adaptive—capable of understanding user behaviors, guiding engagement dynamically, and transitioning seamlessly between real-time assistance and long-term cognitive scaffolding. Building upon these insights, future research should focus on developing structured user-context knowledge spaces that empower LLMs to function as proactive collaborators rather than passive responders. By incorporating context-awareness, proactive engagement, and structured knowledge integration, AI systems can move closer to fostering meaningful, personalized cognitive augmentation.
