LLMs to be proactive, leveraging real-time contextual information to tailor responses and facilitate structured reasoning. Our preliminary study tends to investigate two research questions: • How do individuals sense, process, and apply information in real-world tasks, and what cognitive support do they expect? • How should AI-driven cognitive support systems be designed to enhance knowledge augmentation? To explore these questions, we conducted a think-aloud study in an exhibition setting. Participants navigated exhibits while capturing and synthesizing information for later use. This scenario provided a rich multi-modal environment to observe cognitive behaviors. Findings reveal challenges in structuring contextual information, retrieving knowledge, and leveraging digital tools for context-aware, structured, and proactive engagement. Based on these insights, we outline a context-aware cognitive augmentation approach that allows LLMs to adjust responses dynamically based on user interactions and cognitive needs. This work contributes by identifying key cognitive challenges in knowledge augmentation, offering empirical insights into users’ expectations for AI-driven support, and suggesting design considerations for integrating context-aware reasoning into LLM-based systems. 2 Related Work 2.1 Context-Aware in AI-Augmented System With the current information explosion [ 10], the amount of data we can access keeps increasing. A core objective of modern AI-augmented systems is to help people collect and process information within limited attention spans and working memory capacities [20]. Chen et al. [5] proposed LangAware, which uses in-situ contextual data to filter unnecessary notifications, allowing people to reduce cognitive burdens in different life scenarios, thus achieving better human-machine collaboration. Another approach involves user embeddings, where AI systems create numerical representations of a user’s interac- tion history and cognitive style [12]. These embeddings allow LLMs to adjust response styles dynamically, improving personalization. However, they lack structured knowledge dependencies, such as how a user’s beliefs evolve over time or how exposure to new perspectives influences reasoning [17].
