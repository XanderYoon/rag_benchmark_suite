in knowledge- intensive tasks and interactive systems. Their background ensured they were familiar with information structuring, digital interaction, and knowledge processing, making their insights valuable for understanding cognitive augmentation needs. 3.1.3 Procedure. Before beginning the study, participants were informed that they would need to write a report summarizing key insights from their exhibition visit. This task was designed to ensure they had a concrete goal while navigating the space, encouraging natural engagement with the information. The study followed a think-aloud protocol, where participants freely explored the exhibition while verbalizing their thoughts, strategies, and challenges in processing information. They were allowed to interact with various media, including text, videos, VR, and gesture-based interfaces, and to record notes in any format they preferred. Their interactions were observed and recorded for post-analysis. After the exhibition walkthrough, a semi-structured interview was conducted to capture reflections on their experience, challenges in synthesizing information, and expectations for AI-driven cognitive support.

Participants provided informed consent before participation, and all data were anonymized to protect their privacy. 3.2 Preliminary Findings 3.2.1 Participants’ Information Processing Strategies. Participants processed information through multiple modalities, including text, video, and interactive displays. They used textual content for comprehension and later reference, with some reading aloud to reinforce understanding and others storing text for post-visit review. They treated video recordings as a backup for later reflection rather than an immediate resource. They captured photographs to document key information but struggled with organization and retrieval. Two of the participants (N=2/3) mentioned the intention to annotate images in real-time. Participants unconsciously collected additional information through movement patterns, navigation sequences, and habitual gestures such as
