achieving better human-machine collaboration. Another approach involves user embeddings, where AI systems create numerical representations of a user’s interac- tion history and cognitive style [12]. These embeddings allow LLMs to adjust response styles dynamically, improving personalization. However, they lack structured knowledge dependencies, such as how a user’s beliefs evolve over time or how exposure to new perspectives influences reasoning [17]. Knowledge graphs provide a structured method for representing user information, encoding their knowledge, preferences, and prior interactions into a graph-based system. AI models can query these graphs to retrieve personalized Manuscript submitted to ACM Intelligent Interaction Strategies for Context-Aware Cognitive Augmentation 3 insights, which has been particularly effective in educational AI systems [ 1]. However, applying them to support knowledge-intensive tasks still poses an open research challenge [11]. 2.2 LLM-Empowered Cognitive Augmentation Knowledge Augmentation plays a pivotal role in our life [4, 7], particularly for people with memory impairments [13]. With LLMs demonstrating strong language understanding and mass information processing capabilities [11], having driven innovative applications in information collection. For example, Baek et al. [2] applied LLMs to analyze users’ search engine interaction history as contextual data, providing more personalized web search results. However, this work was limited to traditional desktop interactions without real-world environment integration. Cai et al. [3] further identified interesting but overlooked environmental information through an LLM-empowered system combining explicit and implicit initial triggers. Information organization constitutes another crucial component in knowledge augmentation systems. Yu et al. [16] proposed Bnotehelper, which uses LLMs to rapidly generate note outlines from video content. However, this process neglected the importance of human-in-the-loop mechanisms. Yen et al. [ 15] tackle organizational challenges by transforming static LLM conversation histories into interactive object. LLMs should also assist people in naturally utilizing stored information during daily life. Zulfikar et al. [20] made progress by
