text for post-visit review. They treated video recordings as a backup for later reflection rather than an immediate resource. They captured photographs to document key information but struggled with organization and retrieval. Two of the participants (N=2/3) mentioned the intention to annotate images in real-time. Participants unconsciously collected additional information through movement patterns, navigation sequences, and habitual gestures such as finger-pointing and silent reading. For example, a participant is habitually pointing and silently reading the content they are interested to. They took personal notes that focused more on subjective impressions than on structured content, making later recall difficult. These behaviors showed that participants engaged in both explicit and implicit information processing, requiring AI support to help structure and retrieve knowledge effectively. 3.2.2 Environmental and Social Constraints in Context-Aware AI Interaction. Participants adjusted their engagement strategies based on environmental and social constraints. They hesitated to provide real-time verbal commentary due to privacy concerns. They avoided taking photographs in dimly lit areas to prevent disturbing others. They minimized interactions requiring overt gestures or spoken input to maintain discretion in a shared public setting. These behaviors demonstrated a major limitation in existing AI-driven cognitive augmentation systems. AI systems fail to recognize social and environmental contexts, leading to rigid or intrusive interactions. Participants needed AI support that could adapt to their surroundings, offering subtle interaction methods such as silent note-taking suggestions, discreet notifications for summarization, and adaptive interfaces that adjusted based on the environment. The exhibition setting also introduced cognitive load challenges, requiring participants to selectively focus on key information while filtering distractions. AI tools need to track users’ cognitive states and provide timely, relevant support, such as summarizing dense content or reinforcing key insights. 3.2.3 Participants’ Expectations for Adaptive AI Support. Participants identified two key areas where AI could improve their experience: (1)
