video and audio content, and immersive experiences. This multi-modal environment provided a complex, information-intensive setting where participants engaged with dense academic material through various sensory and interactive modalities. Participants were required to navigate, filter, and synthesize information across multiple formats, often switching between passive consumption (e.g., reading and watching videos) and active interaction (e.g., VR exploration and gesture-based engagement). Additionally, the setting introduced contextual challenges such as time constraints, selective attention demands, and varying levels of engagement across different media. By analyzing participants’ behaviors in this environment, we aimed to uncover how individuals process and retain complex academic content and how AI-driven cognitive augmentation can enhance structured reasoning and information synthesis. Manuscript submitted to ACM 4 Zhu et al. Fig. 1. Overview of the exhibition setup, which includes different modalities of information presentation and interaction. The exhibition integrates various digital and physical interfaces, including large-scale digital displays for visual information (a), textual and interactive tabletop interfaces for content exploration (c, f, g), object-based museum-like exhibits (d), and sensor-based gesture interaction (e). Additionally, there are also immersive simulations (h), which provides an overview of the campus resources and map. The information is mainly composed of academic content (b, c, d, e, f, g) and school information (a, h) 3.1.2 Participants. We recruited three participants, all of whom were MPhil or PhD students from the university. Each participant had at least five years of experience in design or development, making them well-versed in knowledge- intensive tasks and interactive systems. Their background ensured they were familiar with information structuring, digital interaction, and knowledge processing, making their insights valuable for understanding cognitive augmentation needs. 3.1.3 Procedure. Before beginning the study, participants were informed that they would need to write a report summarizing key insights from their exhibition visit. This task was designed to ensure
