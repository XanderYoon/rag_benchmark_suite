the strengths of ICL and RAG can signiﬁcantly improve the quality of educational ques- tion generation. We hypothesize that a hybrid approach, whi ch ﬁrst retrieves relevant external documents (as in RAG) and t hen uses a few-shot learning mechanism (as in ICL) to guide quest ion generation, will result in questions that are not only conte xtually relevant but also pedagogically meaningful. By leveragingexternal information through retrieval and guiding the model’s outp ut with carefully selected examples, we aim to address the shortcomings of each individual method and generate a broader range of quest ions that target various cognitive levels in educational assess ments. This paper makes several key contributions to the ﬁeld of AQG , particularly in the context of educational applications: • A comparative analysis of In-Context Learning (ICL) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for automated ques- tion generation in the educational domain. We evaluate how each method performs individually in generating questions from textbook passages and assess their respective strengths and weaknesses. • A novel hybrid model that combines ICL and RAG to gener- ate higher-quality, contextually accurate, and pedagogically aligned questions. Our hybrid approach leverages external knowledge through retrieval and incorporates in-context learn- ing to guide the generation process. • A comprehensive evaluation of the proposed methods using both automated metrics (e.g., BLEU-4, ROUGE-L, METEOR, ChRF, BERTScore) and human evaluation by educators. We assess the grammaticality, appropriateness, relevance, com- plexity, and answerability, providing insights into the peda- gogical value of each approach. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 revi ews related work in AQG, ICL, and RAG. Section 3 outlines the task deﬁnition and mathematical formulation of the problem. Sec tion 4 discusses the dataset used in our study. In Section 5, we desc ribe the methodology, detailing the implementation of
