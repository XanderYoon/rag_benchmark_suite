Hybrid Model (/u1D458 = 5, /u1D45A = 5) How does purchasing power parity (PPP) assist in comparing l iving standards and currencies across nations? and BERTScore. On the other hand, the Hybrid Model ( /u1D458 = 5, /u1D45A = 5) shows superior performance in human evaluation metrics, i n- cluding grammaticality, appropriateness, relevance, and complexity. The combination of retrieval and in-context learning techn iques allows the Hybrid Model to generate questions with greater d epth and alignment with educational contexts. Overall, both ICL and the Hybrid Model signiﬁcantly outperform the previous base line models, T5-large and BART-large, in both automated and huma n evaluations. These advanced models surpass baselines in ge nerat- ing more relevant and contextually appropriate questions, demon- strating their enhanced capabilities in generating educational ques- tions. In future work, we plan to expand evaluations to diverse datasets and educational domains to better assess the generalizability of our models. We also aim to incorporate feedback from educators a nd students to reﬁne our approaches, ensuring they meet curric ulum Leveraging ICL and RAG for Automatic /Q_uestion Generation in Ed ucational Domains Conference’17,
