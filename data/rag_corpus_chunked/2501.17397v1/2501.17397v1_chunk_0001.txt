A crucial element in these systems is Automatic Qu es- tion Generation (AQG), which refers to the automatic creati on of questions from textual content, such as textbook passages, lecture notes, or online educational materials [7, 28, 30, 44]. AQG h as nu- merous applications, ranging from generating quizzes and a ssess- ments to enhancing student engagement through interactivelearn- ing platforms [11]. Despite recent advancements, there rem ains a signiﬁcant gap in generating high-quality, contextually r elevant, and pedagogically meaningful questions for diverse educat ional settings [19]. With the advent of neural networks and large language models (LLMs),
