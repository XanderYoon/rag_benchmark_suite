Current auto- mated question generation methods often generate question s that are out of context. In this work, we explore advanced techniq ues for automated question generation in educational contexts , focus- ing on In-Context Learning (ICL), Retrieval-Augmented Gen era- tion (RAG), and a novel Hybrid Model that merges both methods . We implement GPT-4 for ICL using few-shot examples and BART with a retrieval module for RAG. The Hybrid Model combines RAG and ICL to address these issues and improve question quality. Eval- uation is conducted using automated metrics, followed by hu man evaluation metrics. Our results show that both the ICL appro ach and the Hybrid Model consistently outperform other methods , in- cluding baseline models, by generating more contextually accurate and relevant questions.
