5), and the Hybrid model ( /u1D458 = 5, /u1D45A = 5). It can be ob- served that while baseline models sometimes produce questi ons that are irrelevant or unanswerable from the context, the proposed techniques, particularly ICL, generate questions that aremore closely aligned with the provided context. 9 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this study, we explored advanced methods for automated qu es- tion generation in educational contexts, focusing on In-Co ntext Learning (ICL), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and a novel Hybrid Model that combines both techniques. Our results rev eal that ICL with /u1D458 = 7 demonstrates superior performance in au- tomated evaluation metrics, such as ROUGE-L, METEOR, CHrF, Conference’17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Maity et al. Table 3: A sample (context and gold standard question) from t he History subject of the EduProbe dataset [27], including questions generated by various models and settings. The highlighted color indicates irrelevant or unanswerable questions according to the context. Context: During the medieval period in India, Islamic rulers held sig niﬁcant power, leading to the blending of Indian and Islamic cultures, which can still be observed in the archite cture and artwork created at that time. The country was gover ned and administered by notable rulers who made exceptional contributions in the ﬁelds of art, culture, literature, and architecture during this period. Gold Standard Question: What is the contribution of the medieval period to Indian his tory? Model Generated Question T5-large (Baseline) [27] What happened in the medieval period in India, which saw a str ong control of Islamic rulers?
