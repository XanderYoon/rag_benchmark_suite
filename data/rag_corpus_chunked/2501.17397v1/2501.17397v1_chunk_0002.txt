44]. AQG h as nu- merous applications, ranging from generating quizzes and a ssess- ments to enhancing student engagement through interactivelearn- ing platforms [11]. Despite recent advancements, there rem ains a signiﬁcant gap in generating high-quality, contextually r elevant, and pedagogically meaningful questions for diverse educat ional settings [19]. With the advent of neural networks and large language models (LLMs), AQG systems have made signiﬁcant strides [3]. Model s such as T5 [38], BART [22], and GPT-3 [6] have demonstrated re - markable success in tasks such as summarization [39], trans lation [12], question-answering [49], and dialogue generation [14]. These models, when ﬁne-tuned on question-answer datasets, can ge ner- ate more diverse and grammatically correct questions. Howe ver, they still face challenges in the educational domain, parti cularly when it comes to generating pedagogically appropriate ques tions that align with the instructional goals of a given curriculum [3]. Ad- ditionally, the success of these models often depends on the avail- ability of large, domain-speciﬁc training datasets, which are scarce in educational contexts [3]. Recent advances in In-Context Learning (ICL) [6] and Retrieval- Augmented Generation (RAG) [23] provide promising new avenues for tackling the limitations of traditional AQG methods. Un like conventional ﬁne-tuning, ICL enables large pre-trained la nguage models to generate task-speciﬁc outputs by providing a few i nput- output examples without updating the model’s parameters. T his makes ICL particularly useful in educational settings with limited domain-speciﬁc data, where the few-shot examples guide themodel to generate contextually relevant questions for new passages. How- ever, the quality of the generated questions relies heavily on the representativeness of the provided examples. On the other h and, RAG, as proposed by [23], enhances the generation process by in- tegrating a retrieval mechanism into the generation pipeli ne. It retrieves semantically relevant external
