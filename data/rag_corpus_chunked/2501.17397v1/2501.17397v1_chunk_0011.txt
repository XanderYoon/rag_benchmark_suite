This retrie val sys- tem, implemented using FAISS [17], searches through an extensive external corpus of educational materials 2 speciﬁcally tailored for school-level subjects such as History, Geography, Economi cs, Sci- ence, and Environmental Studies. For a given passage/u1D443 , the system identiﬁes the most relevant documents from this curated cor pus. These retrieved documents denoted as { /u1D445/u1D456} /u1D458 /u1D456=1, are concatenated with /u1D443 , and the combined input is processed through a ﬁne-tuned BART model trained on the EduProbe training set [27] to gener - ate a question /u1D444 . The ﬁne-tuning of BART on EduProbe ensures that the model is adept at generating questions based on educ a- tional content, further enhancing its performance. Formal ly, ques- tion generation in RAG is deﬁned as: /u1D444 = /u1D453RAG( /u1D443, { /u1D445/u1D456} /u1D458 /u1D456=1) 1https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Council_of_Educational_Research_and_Training 2https://ncert.nic.in/textbook.php Conference’17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Maity et al. The retrieval module enriches the context, allowing the mod el to generate questions that are better aligned with the conte nt and objectives of the passage. 5.3 Hybrid Model Our Hybrid Model combines the retrieval-based context enrichment of RAG with the few-shot learning mechanism of ICL using GPT-4. First, relevant documents are retrieved for a given passage/u1D443 . Then, the few-shot learning mechanism uses these retrieved docum ents alongside the input passage to generate a more contextually accu- rate and pedagogically meaningful question. The hybrid app roach can be mathematically deﬁned as: /u1D444 = /u1D453Hybrid ( /u1D443, { /u1D445/u1D456} /u1D458 /u1D456=1, {( /u1D443 /u1D456, /u1D444 /u1D456)} /u1D45A /u1D456=1) Here, /u1D443 is the input passage, { /u1D445/u1D456} /u1D458 /u1D456=1 are the retrieved docu- ments, and {( /u1D443 /u1D456, /u1D444 /u1D456)} /u1D45A /u1D456=1 are the few-shot examples used to guide the question generation process. 6 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP Our experiments evaluate the eﬀectiveness of the In-Context Learn-
