or compositional ques- tion answering tasks (Tang and Yang, 2024). 2.2 Refinement and Iteration in RAG To address the limitations of ranking-based re- trieval, recent studies have explored retrieval strate- gies better aligned with the needs of RAG. These include adaptive retrieval based on query com- plexity (Jeong et al., 2024), multi-step reasoning with agent-based ranking (Niu et al., 2024), and context pruning (Chirkova et al., 2025). Iterative methods such as Self-RAG (Asai et al., 2023) and CoRAG (Wang et al., 2024) refine queries or per- form multi-round retrieval to improve relevance. While effective, these approaches often en- tail substantial computational overhead and are sensitive to prompt design and hyperparameter choices (Asai et al., 2023; Niu et al., 2024). In contrast, our study provides a lightweight and efficient alternative by selecting a coherent sub- set of passages in a single step through explicit modeling of information requirements. This set- oriented approach is compatible with iterative re- trieval pipelines and can also function as a direct replacement for conventional rerankers in standard RAG systems. 3 S ETR: Set-wise Passage Selection for Retrieval-Augmented Generation In this section, we present SETR (Set-wise passage selection for Retrieval-Augmented Generation), a novel retrieval paradigm that moves beyond con- ventional reranking strategies. We begin by formal- izing the passage selection task and motivating the need for a set-oriented perspective (§3.1). Next, we present our information requirement identifica- tion (IRI) method, which utilizes Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to guide passage selection (§3.2). Finally, we describe the architecture and train- ing methodology of SETR, a distilled model fine- tuned for efficient set-wise passage selection (§3.3), along with the data construction details (§3.3.1) and training procedures (§3.3.2). 3.1 Task Definition We define the passage retrieval task as the process of selecting an optimal set of passages from a pool of retrieved
