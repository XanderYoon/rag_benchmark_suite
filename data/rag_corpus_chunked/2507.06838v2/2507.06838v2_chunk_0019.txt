comparison between SETR- CoT and SETR-CoT & IRI demonstrates that ex- plicitly identifying essential information during the reasoning process helps improve selection preci- sion and ensures broader information coverage. Unified Setting for Direct Comparison. To fur- ther minimize potential bias, we create a unified training setting, in which all models are (1) built on the same base architecture (Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct), (2) trained on the same teacher supervision (re- annotated with gpt-4o-2024-08-06), and (3) eval- uated using identical generation protocols. As shown in Table 4, SETR again surpasses rerank- ing baselines in end-to-end QA accuracy across all tasks, reaffirming the advantages of selection- based approaches. This carefully controlled com- parison highlights a critical insight: ranking-based reasoning, even with CoT, tends to collapse multi- ple reasoning chains into a single score, potentially obscuring key informational elements. In contrast, our selection strategy preserves intermediate rea- soning steps, resulting in better alignment with the actual information needs of the question. These findings collectively demonstrate that the observed performance gains stem not from stronger base Method MultiHopRAG HotpotQA 2WikiMultiHopQA MuSiQue Reranker GeneratorReranker GeneratorReranker GeneratorReranker Generator Output Input Output Input Output Input Output Input DIRECT INFERENCE RankZephyr (Llama-3.1-8B-Inst)80 2672 80 1426 80 1504 80 1403 SETR-Selection only 17 1441 11 461 10 422 11 499 WITH REASONING RankZephyr + CoT (Llama-3.1-8B-Inst)603 2665 574 1435 560 1434 599 1385 SETR-CoT 396 1517 383 426 376 333 412 439 SETR-CoT & IRI 409 1240 317 432 276 332 340 503 Table 5: Efficiency analysis on token usage.
