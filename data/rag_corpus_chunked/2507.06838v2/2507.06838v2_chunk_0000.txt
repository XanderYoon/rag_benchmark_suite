Existing approaches primarily rerank top- k passages based on their individual relevance, often fail- ing to meet the information needs of complex queries in multi-hop question answering. In this work, we propose a set-wise passage se- lection approach and introduce SETR, which explicitly identifies the information require- ments of a query through Chain-of-Thought reasoning and selects an optimal set of pas- sages that collectively satisfy those require- ments. Experiments on multi-hop RAG bench- marks show that SETR outperforms both pro- prietary LLM-based rerankers and open-source baselines in terms of answer correctness and retrieval quality, providing an effective and ef- ficient alternative to traditional rerankers in RAG systems.

Retrieval- Augmented Generation (RAG) overcomes critical limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly their inability to incorporate up-to- date or domain-specific knowledge without retrain- ing (Mallen et al., 2023). The risk of generating hal- lucinations is another concern when the model ca- pacity is not sufficiently large (Huang et al., 2024). By integrating an external retrieval system that pro- vides contextually relevant and grounded evidence in real time, RAG improves both the accuracy and reliability of knowledge-intensive tasks. A critical component of RAG systems is the re- trieval and reranking module, as the quality of the †These authors contributed equally to this work. retrieved information directly influences the accu- racy and relevance
