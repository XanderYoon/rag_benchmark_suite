Each question includes an explicit reasoning path linking entities across documents. The dataset tests compositional reasoning and requires models to use both un- structured text and structured knowledge to answer questions. • MusiQue (Trivedi et al., 2022) is a multi-hop QA benchmark designed to prevent reason- ing shortcuts by requiring genuine multi-step reasoning. It includes around 25k questions composed from connected single-hop queries, each requiring 2 to 4 reasoning steps. The dataset emphasizes strong logical dependen- cies between steps and includes unanswerable variants to test robustness. MuSiQue is more challenging than earlier datasets and high- lights significant performance gaps between humans and models. • MultiHopRAG (Tang and Yang, 2024) is a recent benchmark for evaluating retrieval- augmented generation on complex multi-hop queries. Unlike the above QA datasets, Multi- HopRAG is specifically built to evaluate end- to-end RAG systems. It includes 2,556 ques- tions over a corpus of English news articles, with answers supported by evidence from 2 to 4 documents. The queries involve tempo- ral and entity-based reasoning and require re- trieving and synthesizing information across multiple sources. This makes the dataset well- suited for evaluating our set-wise passage se- lection approach. A.2 Baselines Following reranking models are considered as base- lines: • bge-reranker-large (Xiao et al., 2023) is a lightweight cross-encoder model from BAAI that scores query–passage pairs using full cross-attention, enabling more accurate rele- vance judgments than embedding-based mod- els. Fine-tuned on large-scale data, it is com- monly used to rescore top-k results in retrieval pipelines. As a strong open-source baseline, it reflects state-of-the-art conventional reranking focused on individual passage relevance. • RankLlama (Ma et al., 2024) is a pointwise reranker based on LLaMA-2 7B model (Tou- vron et al., 2023). Given a query and a can- didate passage, it outputs a score to reorder retrieved documents by
