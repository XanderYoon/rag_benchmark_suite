number of passages utilized for answer generation. Note that SETR utilizes fewer than 5 passages on average for answer generation. surement of how much necessary information is covered by the selected passages. The formula used to calculate information coverage is detailed in Appendix A.3. We report two complementary metrics: Hit@ k, which reflects whether gold evi- dence appears in the top-k selected passages, and information coverage, which measure the accumu- lation of distinct gold evidences across the selected evidences. As illustrated in Figure 3a and Figure 3d, de- spite SETR selects passages without any ordering, it outperforms reranking methods with a notable improvement at Hit@ k from 48.87% to 69.90%. Furthermore, SETR enhances information coverage from 19.33% to 36.49%, whereas other rerankers achieve only a modest average gain of 9.80% in the acquisition of new information. These findings suggest that reranking methods may struggle to re- trieve documents containing previously uncovered information due to the presence of duplicate con- tent and hard negatives. In contrast, our method captures both individual relevance and collective information coverage, which are essential for im- proving retrieval effectiveness and overall answer correctness. Robustness. We further assess the robustness of our approach to retrieval noise by analyzing how answer generation quality changes as the number of passages increases. As shown in Figure 3b, 3c, 3e, and 3f, simply increasing the number of input passages often leads to performance degradation, suggesting that more is not always better. This is especially pronounced in multi-hop QA, where ir- relevant or contradictory evidence can mislead the generator. In contrast, SETR consistently achieves stronger performance while utilizing significantly fewer passages. On average, it uses 2.91 passages compared to the standard top 5 used in rerank- ing. This demonstrates the model’s ability to dis- criminate high-utility information from distractors, thereby maintaining both
