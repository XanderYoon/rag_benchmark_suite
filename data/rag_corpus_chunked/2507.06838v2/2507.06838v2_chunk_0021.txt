and recall. This suggests a useful accuracy-efficiency trade-off spectrum that practi- tioners can tune based on resource constraints and latency budgets. 6 Discussion Our work highlights the limitations of conventional top-k retrieval in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems and proposes a set-wise passage selection approach to better address the unique in- formation needs of generative models. By incorpo- rating information requirement identification and Chain-of-Thought reasoning for passage selection, SETR (Set-wise passage selection for Retrieval- Augmented Generation), enhances retrieval preci- sion and improves end-to-end answer accuracy. A promising direction for future work is en- abling efficient selection from large candidate pas- sage pools (e.g., 100 passages). Unlike traditional listwise reranking, which often relies on sequential sliding windows, our approach supports parallel, order-agnostic selection—reducing time complex- ity and improving scalability. Additionally, future work could explore how SETR iteratively refines queries for better retrieval and develops adaptive se- lection techniques to adjust the number of selected passages based on domain-specific needs. Limitations While our set-wise passage selection approach im- proves retrieval quality and efficiency in RAG sys- tems, it has several limitations. First, our method relies on a predefined retrieval pipeline, meaning its performance is still depen- dent on the initial retrieval stage. If the initial retrieved set lacks critical information, even an optimal set-wise selection cannot compensate for missing knowledge. Second, our method optimizes retrieval for multi- hop and complex queries but has not yet been val- idated across diverse RAG domains such as code generation or conversational AI. While we antic- ipate broader applicability, further evaluation on diverse tasks is needed. Lastly, our approach relies on the quality of the underlying language model for reasoning-based selection. While chain-of-thought reasoning im- proves passage selection, its effectiveness depends on the LLM’s ability to accurately analyze and syn- thesize information.
