a small number of passages. LLM-based rankers, paired with advanced re- trievers, perform well on rank-based metrics com- pared to the first-stage retrieval baselines. Specifi- cally, RankGPT (gpt-4o) shows notable improve- ments in both rank-based and presense-based met- rics. However, we observe a discrepancy be- tween rank-based metrics and end-to-end QA per- formance, as shown in Table 1. This discrepancy arises from the assumption in rank-based metrics that relevance is determined on a one-to-one basis between a document and a query. For more complex question types, such as multi-hop questions, where considering relation- ships between multiple documents is needed for comprehensive information retrieval, these metrics may need further refinement to improve accuracy.

We evaluate the quality of selected passages in terms of infor- mation coverage and robustness (§5.1), assess the impact of reasoning strategies including informa- tion requirement identification (IRI) and Chain- of-Thought (CoT) §5.2, design a controlled setup to isolate method-level effects (§5.3), and com- pare token efficiency between selection-based and reranking-based methods (§5.4). 5.1 Effectiveness of Set Selection: Informativeness and Robustness We analyze the effectiveness of our selection ap- proach in terms of two key perspectives: (1) in-
