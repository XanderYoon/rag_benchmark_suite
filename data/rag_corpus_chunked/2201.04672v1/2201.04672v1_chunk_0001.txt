theory and through experiments [6, 12, 16, 20, 32]. Empowered by the structured docu- ment representation of concept maps, it is intriguing to apply powerful GNNs for tasks like document classiﬁcation [38] and retrieval [45]. Take Fig. 1 as an example. Towards the query about “violent crimes in society”, a proper GNN might be able to highlight query-relevant concept of “crime” and its connec- tion to “robbery” and “citizen”, thus ranking the document as highly relevant. On the other hand, for another document about precaution, the GNN can cap- ture concepts like “n95 mask” and “vaccine”, together with their connections to “prevention”, thus ranking it as not so relevant. ⋆ Corresponding Author. arXiv:2201.04672v1 [cs.IR] 12 Jan 2022 2 H.

An overview of GNN-based document retrieval. Present work. In this work, we explore how GNNs can help document retrieval with generated concept maps. The core contributions are three-fold: • We use constituency parsing to construct semantically rich concept maps from documents and design quality evaluation for them towards document retrieval. • We investigate two types of graph models for document retrieval: the structure- oriented complex GNNs and our proposed semantics-oriented graph functions. • By comparing the retrieval results from diﬀerent graph models, we provide insights towards GNN model design for textual retrieval, with the hope to prompt more discussions on the emerging areas such as IR with GNNs. 2 GNNs for Document Retrieval 2.1 Overview In this section, we describe the process of GNN-based document retrieval.
