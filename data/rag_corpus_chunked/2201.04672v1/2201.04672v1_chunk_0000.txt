Graph neural networks (GNNs), as a group of powerful tools for representation learning on irregular data, have manifested superior- ity in various downstream tasks. With unstructured texts represented as concept maps, GNNs can be exploited for tasks like document re- trieval. Intrigued by how can GNNs help document retrieval, we con- duct an empirical study on a large-scale multi-discipline dataset CORD- 19. Results show that instead of the complex structure-oriented GNNs such as GINs and GATs, our proposed semantics-oriented graph func- tions achieve better and more stable performance based on the BM25 retrieved candidates. Our insights in this case study can serve as a guideline for future work to develop eﬀective GNNs with appropriate semantics-oriented inductive biases for textual reasoning tasks like doc- ument retrieval and classiﬁcation.

Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) at- tract tremendous attention due to their superior power established both in theory and through experiments [6, 12, 16, 20, 32]. Empowered by the structured docu- ment representation of concept maps, it is intriguing to apply powerful GNNs for tasks like document classiﬁcation [38] and retrieval [45]. Take Fig. 1 as an example. Towards the query about “violent crimes in society”, a proper GNN might be able to highlight query-relevant concept of
