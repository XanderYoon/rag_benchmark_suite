[17, 27, 31] that uses the sliding window technique to capture node co-occurrence. The window size is selected through grid search. Our proposed constituency parsing approach for concept map gener- ation alleviates the limited vocabulary problem of existing NER-based methods, thus bolstering the semantic richness of the concept maps for retrieval. 2.3 GNN-based Concept Map Representation Learning Structure-oriented complex GNNs Various GNNs have been proposed for graph representation learning [12, 16, 32, 36]. The discriminative power of com- plex GNNs mainly stems from the 1-WL test for graph isomorphism, which ex- haustively capture possible graph structures so as to diﬀerentiate non-isomorphic graphs [36]. To investigate the eﬀectiveness of structured-oriented GNNs towards document retrieval, we adopt two state-of-the-art ones, Graph isomorphism net- work (GIN) [36] and Graph attention network (GAT) [32], as representatives. Semantics-oriented permutation-invariant graph functions The advan- tage of complex GNNs in modelling interactions may become insigniﬁcant for semantically important task. In contrast, we propose the following series of graph functions oriented from semantics perspectives. – N-Pool : independently process each single node vi in the concept map by multi-layer perceptions and then apply a read-out function to aggregate all node embeddings ai into the graph embedding hG, i.e., hG = READOUT ( {MLP(ai) | vi ∈ V } ) . (2) – E-Pool : for each edge eij = (vi, vj) in the concept map, the edge embedding is obtained by concatenating the projected node embedding ai and aj on its two ends to encode ﬁrst-order interactions, i.e., hG = READOUT ( {cat (MLP(ai), MLP(aj)) | eij ∈ E} ) .
