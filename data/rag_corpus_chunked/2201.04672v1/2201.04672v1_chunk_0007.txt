1.42 2.53 56.1951.41 initial candidates. Three types of pairs are constructed: a Pos-Pos pair consists of two documents both relevant to a query; a Pos-Neg pair consists of a relevant and an irrelevant one; and a Pos-BM pair consists of a relevant one and a top-20 one from BM25. Given a graph pair Gi and Gj, their similarity is calculated via four measures: the node coincidence rate (NCR) deﬁned as |Vi∩Vj| |Vi∪Vj|; NCR+ deﬁned as NCR weighted by the tf-idf score [1] of each node; the edge coincidence rate (ECR) where an edge is coincident when its two ends are contained in both graphs; and ECR+ deﬁned as ECR weighted by the tf-idf scores of both ends. It is shown in Table 1 that Pos-Neg pairs are less similar than Pos-Pos under all measures, indicating that concept maps can eﬀectively reﬂect document se- mantics. Moreover, Pos-BM pairs are not close to Pos-Pos and even further away than Pos-Neg. This is because the labeled “irrelevant” documents are actually hard negative ones diﬃcult to distinguish. Such results indicate the potential for improving sketchy candidates with concept maps. Besides, student’s t-Test [13] is performed, where standard critical values of (Pos-Pos, Pos-Neg) and (Pos-Pos, Pos-BM) under 95% conﬁdence are 1.6440 and 1.6450, respectively. The calcu- lated t-scores shown in Table 1 strongly support the signiﬁcance of diﬀerences. 3.3 Retrieval Performance Results In this study, we focus on the performance improvement of GNN models based on sketchy candidates. Therefore, two widely-used and simple models, the fore- mentioned BM25 and Anserini3, are adopted as baselines, instead of the heavier language models such as BERT-based [8, 9, 41] and learning to rank (LTR)- based [2,35] ones. The retrieval performance are shown in Table 2. All the values are reported as the averaged results of ﬁve runs under
