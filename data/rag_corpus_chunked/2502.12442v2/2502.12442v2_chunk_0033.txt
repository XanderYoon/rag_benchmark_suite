Figure 7(a), one example edge with two vertices in Figure 6(a). Using the query "Donnie Smith who plays as a left back for New England Revolution belongs to what league featuring 22 teams?" as an example we conduct a qualitative analysis. For this multi-hop question (correct answer: Major League Soccer), the HotpotQA corpus contains three relevant sen- tences: (1) "Donald W. Donnie Smith (born Decem- ber 7, 1990 in Detroit, Michigan) is an American soccer player who plays as a left back for New England Revolution in Major League Soccer."; (2) "Major League Soccer (MLS) is a men’s profes- sional soccer league, sanctioned by U.S. Soccer, that represents the sport’s highest level in both the United States and Canada." and (3) "The league comprises 22 teams in the U.S. and 3 in Canada." With dense retriever (BGE), we can easily re- trieve the first sentence but the last two facts can’t be retrieved in the context even with a topk of 30. However, in our graph-structured index, these three vertices are logically connected, as is shown in Fig- ure 6(b). During the traversal, LLM starts from the Figure 4: Prompt for generating in-coming questions. semantically similar but indirectly relevant vertices and can reach all the supporting facts within only a maximum of 3 hops. Using this query and its passages for demonstra- tion, we provide the visualizations of HopRAG’s graph index against GraphRAG to help readers grasp the differences and innovations. As shown in Figure 7 , the main differences between HopRAG and GraphRAG are listed as follows. • Vertices. GraphRAG uses LLM to summarize the information from text chunks and then cre- ates additional vertices (e.g., event, organiza- tion and person) in the graph, while HopRAG directly stores the original chunks in the ver- tices and thus avoids LLM
