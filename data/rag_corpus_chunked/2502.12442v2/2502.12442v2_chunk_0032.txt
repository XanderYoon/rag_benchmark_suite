We report the basic statistics of the graph structure on different datasets and demonstrate that our efficient graph structure is traversal-friendly. For query decomposition, we use GPT-4o-mini to break down the query into multiple sub-queries, each of which should be a single-hop query. With m sub-queries we conduct dense retrieval with BGE for each sub-query to get topk/m candidates independently and combine them all for final con- text. For reranking baseline, we use bge-reranker- base to rank2∗topk candidates from dense retriever BGE and keep the topk ones as the final context. The structured baseline methods rely on specific open-source projects according to their papers. A.5 Prompts The prompt used for generating in-coming ques- tions is shown in Figure 4. The prompt used for generating out-coming questions is shown in Fig- ure 5. The prompt for reasoning-augmented graph traversal is shown in Figure 8. A.6 Case Study We demonstrate the graph structure in Figure 7(a), one example edge with two vertices in Figure 6(a). Using the query "Donnie Smith who plays as a left back for New England Revolution belongs to what league featuring 22 teams?" as an example we conduct a qualitative analysis. For this multi-hop question (correct answer: Major League Soccer), the HotpotQA corpus contains three relevant sen- tences: (1) "Donald
