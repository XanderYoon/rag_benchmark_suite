To address this, we proposeHopRAG, a novel RAG framework that augments retrieval with logical reasoning through graph-structured knowledge exploration. During indexing, Ho- pRAG constructs a passage graph, with text chunks as vertices and logical connections es- tablished via LLM-generated pseudo-queries as edges. During retrieval, it employs a retrieve- reason-prune mechanism: starting with lexi- cally or semantically similar passages, the sys- tem explores multi-hop neighbors guided by pseudo-queries and LLM reasoning to iden- tify truly relevant ones. Experiments on mul- tiple multi-hop benchmarks demonstrate that HopRAG’sretrieve-reason-prune mechanism can expand the retrieval scope based on logical connections and improve final answer quality. 1 Introduction “Everyone and everything is six or fewer steps away, by way of introduction, from any other person in the world. ” — Six Degrees of Separation Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has be- come the standard approach for large language models (LLMs) to tackle knowledge-intensive tasks (Guu et al., 2020a; Lewis et al., 2020a; Izac- ard et al., 2022; Min et al., 2023; Ram et al., 2023; Liang et al., 2025). Not only can it effectively address the inherent knowledge limitations and hal- lucination issues (Zhang et al., 2023), but it can also enable easy interpretability and provenance tracking (Akyurek et al., 2022).
