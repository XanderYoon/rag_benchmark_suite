topk bud- get. However, lexically or semantically similar passages complement each other. Hopping between passages, by questions as pathways, improves the retrieval accuracy and completeness. passages within a single document, but ignores re- lations beyond the hierarchical structure or across documents. Further, it introduces redundant infor- mation across different levels. Graph-structured RAG (Soman et al., 2024; Kang et al., 2023; Edge et al., 2024a; Guo et al., 2024) models logical rela- tions in the most ideal form by constructing knowl- edge graphs (KGs) to represent documents, where entities are vertices and their relations are edges. However, the reliance on predefined schemas limits the flexible expressive capability (Li et al., 2024); constructing and updating knowledge graphs are challenging and prone to errors or omissions (Edge et al., 2024a); the triplet format of knowledge ne- cessitates extra textualization or fine-tuning to im- prove LLMs’ understanding (He et al., 2024). Motivation As reported by (Wang et al., 2024a), even with advanced real-world search engines, roughly 70% retrieved passages do not directly contain true answers in their settings. We con- firm the severity of imperfect retrieval in terms of both precision and recall, as illustrated in Figure 1(a). Inspired by the small-world theory (Kleinberg, 2000) or six degrees of separation (Guare, 2016), we propose that, although lexically and semanti- cally similar passages could be indirectly relevant or even distracting, they can serve as helpful start- ing points to reach truly relevant ones. As shown in Figure 1(b), considering a graph composed of passages with logical relations as edges, a large proportion of retrieved passages fall within several hops of the ground truths. Based on these observations, we propose Ho- pRAG, an innovative graph-structured RAG sys- tem. At indexing phase, we construct a graph- structured knowledge index with passages as ver- tices and logic relations
