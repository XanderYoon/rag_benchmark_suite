out-coming triplet r+ s,i of source vertex vs, the most matching in-coming triplet r− t∗,j∗ is determined as follows: SIM(r+ s,i, r− t,j) = |k+ s,i∩k− t,j | |k+ s,i∪k− t,j | + v+ s,i·v− t,j ||v+ s,i||·||v− t,j || 2 r− t∗,j∗ = arg max r− t,j SIM(r+ s,i, r− t,j) (1) We then build the directed edge ⟨vs, es,t∗, vt∗⟩ with aggregated features, where es,t∗ := (q− t∗,j∗, k− t∗,j∗ ∪ k+ s,i, v− t∗,j∗). 3.3 Reasoning-Augmented Graph Traversal For more accurate and complete responses, Ho- pRAG’s retrieval strategy leverages the reasoning ability of LLM to explore the neighborhood of probably indirectly relevant passages and hop to relevant ones based on the logical relations in the graph structure. As shown in Algorithm 1, by rea- soning over the questions on out edges ei,j of a current vertex vi and then choosing to hop to the most promising vertex vj, we realize reasoning- augmented graph traversal for better retrieval per- formance. Retrieval Phase To start the local search over the graph for query q, we first use NER(·) and EMB(·) to get the keywords kq and vector vq of q, which will be used for hybrid retrieval to match topk sim- ilar edges ⟨vi, ei,j, vj⟩, following Equation 1. With each vertex vj from these edges we initialize a context queue Cqueue for breadth-first local search (V oudouris et al., 2010). Reasoning Phase To fully exploit the logical re- lations over the graph and hop from indirectly rele- vant vertices to relevant ones, we introduce breadth- first local search which utilizes the LLM to choose the most appropriate neighbor for eachvj in Cqueue to append to the tail of the queue. Specifically, for each vj in Cqueue in each round of hop, we lever- age LLM to reason over
