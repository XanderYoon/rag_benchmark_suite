rela- tions for handling multi-hop QA. Specifically, BM25, BGE and BGE with query decomposition yield unsatisfactory results since they rely solely on similarity, and BGE with rerank- ing cannot capture logical relevance among can- didates. Since GraphRAG considers relevance among entities instead of similarity for graph search, and RAPTOR focuses on the hierarchical logical relations among passages but cannot cap- ture other kinds of relevance, both of them are more suitable for query-focused summarization but not the most competitive method for multi-hop QA tasks, as also reported in (Zhang et al., 2024). In terms of HippoRAG, it prioritizes relevance signals such as vertices with the most edges and does not explicitly model similarity while our de- sign HopRAG directly integrates similarity with logical relations when constructing edges. Al- though HopRAG only outperforms SiReRAG by a small margin in the scenario with top 20 candidate passages, our general graph structure does not in- troduce additional summary and proposition aggre- gate nodes and can facilitate efficient graph traver- sal for faster retrieval compared with SiReRAG. In the discussion, we will show that HopRAG can achieve competitive results with a smaller context length. Besides quantitative scores, we also demon- strate a case study in Appendix A.6 comparing HopRAG and GraphRAG. 4.3 Ablations and Discussion To confirm the robustness of HopRAG and provide more insights, we vary topk, nhop and conduct ablation studies on traversal model. Effects of topk To show our efficiency in faster hop from indirectly relevant passages to truly rel- evant ones, we test the robustness by evaluating both the QA and retrieval performance on GPT-3.5- turbo with smaller topk, as is shown in Table 3. From the results, we find that even with top 12 can- didates, the QA performance of HopRAG is still comparable to that of HippoRAG or
