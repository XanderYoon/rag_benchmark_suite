with a minimum requirement of at least 2 in-coming questions and 4 out-coming questions. To prevent the graph struc- ture from becoming overly complex and dense, we retain only O(n · log(n)) edges, where n is the number of vertices. We use GPT-4o-mini for reasoning-augmented graph traversal, GPT-4o and GPT-3.5-turbo for inference with 2048 max tokens and 0.1 temperature in our main experiments. For sparse and dense retrievers, we use the Neo4j database to conduct retrieval on the vertices. With this setting, we align the retrieval engine for un- structured baselines with HopRAG to fairly demon- strate the effectiveness of our graph structure index. symbol meaning symbol meaning P passage corpus Q+ i set of out-coming questions forpi p passage q+ i,j the j-th out-coming question forpi q query Q− i set of in-coming questions forpi C retrieval context q− i,j the j-th in-coming question forpi P(·|·) LLM distribution K+ i set of keywords forQ+ i O response forq k+ i,j keywords forq+ i,j G graph K− i set of keywords forQ− i V set of vertices k− i,j keywords forq− i,j v vertex V + i set of embeddings forQ+ i E set of directed edges v+ i,j embedding forq+ i,j ei,j directed edge fromvi to vj V − i set of embeddings forQ− i kq keywords forq v− i,j embedding forq− i,j vq embedding forq R+ i set of out-coming triplets Ccount counter of vertices during traversalr+ i,j out-coming triplet forq+ i,j Cqueue queue of vertices during traversal R− i set of in-coming triplets H helpfulness metric r− i,j in-coming triplet forq− i,j topk context budget nhop number of hop Table 6: Table of symbols and meanings. dataset number docs supporting facts vertices edges avg text length avg edge number MuSiQue 1000 19990 2800 13086 81348 489.52 6.22
