passage pi: (1) m out-coming questions Q+ i = S 1≤j≤m{q+ i,j} that originate from this passage but cannot be answered by itself; (2) n in-coming questions Q− i = S 1≤j≤n{q− i,j} whose answers are within the passage. As demonstrated in Figure 2, for the toy passage "Rose is the princess in the story The Frog Prince", one in-coming ques- tion might be "What is the name of the princess?" and one out-coming question might be "How is the frog connected to Rose?". The prompts are in Appendix A.5. We extract keywords from Q+ i and Q− i using named entity recognition NER(·) for sparse repre- sentation, and embed these questions into seman- tic vectors using an embedding model EMB(·) for dense representation. This results in sparse rep- resentations K+ i = S 1≤j≤m{k+ i,j} and K− i =S 1≤j≤n{k− i,j}, and dense representations V + i =S 1≤j≤m{v+ i,j} and V − i = S 1≤j≤n{v− i,j}. We further define out-coming triplets as r+ i,j := (q+ i,j, k+ i,j, v+ i,j) and in-coming triplets r− i,j := (q− i,j, k− i,j, v− i,j). Each passage pi is stored inside a vertex vi, featured with its out-coming triplets R+ i = S 1≤j≤m{r+ i,j} and in-coming tripletsR− i =S 1≤j≤n{r− i,j}. Edge Merging Given the out-coming and in- coming triplets, we match paired triplets via hy- brid retrieval and establish directed edges between the corresponding passages. For each out-coming triplet r+ s,i of source vertex vs, the most matching in-coming triplet r− t∗,j∗ is determined as follows: SIM(r+ s,i, r− t,j) = |k+ s,i∩k− t,j | |k+ s,i∪k− t,j | + v+ s,i·v− t,j ||v+ s,i||·||v− t,j || 2 r− t∗,j∗ = arg max r− t,j SIM(r+ s,i, r− t,j) (1) We then build the directed edge ⟨vs,
