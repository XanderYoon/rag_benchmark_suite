We vary nhop from 1 to 4 and report both the answer and retrieval metrics. For answer metrics, we report the answer EM and F1 score; For retrieval metrics, we report the F1 score and average number of calling LLM during traversal to measure the cost (the lower, the better). The best score is in bold and the second best is underlined. Figure 8: Prompt for reasoning-augmented graph traversal.
