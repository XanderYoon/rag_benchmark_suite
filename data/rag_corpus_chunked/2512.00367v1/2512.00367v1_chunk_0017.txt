time taken to retrieve relevant chunks and generate an answer. This reiterates our claim for using light and simple models for fast and improved chunking. 6 Conclusion Our approach demonstrates a substantial improvement in retrieval effectiveness, with the MFC chunker trained on the E5 embedding model achieving an MRR increase of up to 24 times over baseline methods. This performance gain high- lights the power of domain-specific semantic chunking in optimizing retrieval- augmented generation (RAG) pipelines. By producing chunks that naturally align with human-authored section boundaries, our method preserves contex- tual coherence and facilitates more accurate retrieval, which in turn benefits downstream generation quality. Beyond PubMedQA, our results on out-of-domain datasets indicate strong potential for generalization, suggesting that the principles of semantic chunking we present are transferable across domains. This work not only provides a con- crete, reproducible methodology for chunking optimization but also introduces a freshperspectiveondocumentsegmentation,acriticalyetunderexploredcompo- nent in RAG systems. We believe that our findings can serve as a foundation for future research in retrieval-aware chunking strategies, adaptive chunk size deter- mination, and domain-adaptive retrieval optimization. The lightweight models introduced in this paper can be integrated into complex models resulting in more sophisticated approaches. Breaking It Down 11 References 1.
