ROUGE [9], BLEU [10], and BERTScore [21]. Keeping the retriever and gener- ator constant ensures all performance differences arise solely from the chunking strategy. Each dataset, chunker, and encoder configuration follows a unified workflow: thedocumentissegmented,itsembeddingsareindexed,themostrelevantchunks are retrieved for a given query, and a generator model produces the final answer.

The p-test values between PSC and Sem across the three embeddings and metrics were in the order ofe−11 and t-test values greater than 7. Query Time and Time to First Token (TTFT) indicate that PSC is the fastest. This integrated design removes redundant pipelines, enforces consistent evalua- tion across setups, and offers a scalable framework for systematically comparing RAG components. 5 Analysis Our trained chunkers significantly outperform commonly used methods, MRR improves from 0.0086 (recursive) to 0.2914 (PSC in e5) and Hits@5 from 0.0028 to 0.1234 (PSC in e5), as shown in Table 1. The library implementation of semantic chunker under performs in retrieval (MRR: 0.0130 vs. 0.2914 for PSC) due to its reliance on cosine similarity for
