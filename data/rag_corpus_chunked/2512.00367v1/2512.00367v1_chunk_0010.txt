RAG components. 5 Analysis Our trained chunkers significantly outperform commonly used methods, MRR improves from 0.0086 (recursive) to 0.2914 (PSC in e5) and Hits@5 from 0.0028 to 0.1234 (PSC in e5), as shown in Table 1. The library implementation of semantic chunker under performs in retrieval (MRR: 0.0130 vs. 0.2914 for PSC) due to its reliance on cosine similarity for chunk boundary detection, which often results in suboptimal segmentation. These results confirm that chunk quality strongly influences retrieval effectiveness. Generation results on PubMedQA (Table 2) show PSC and MFC performing competitivelyandoftensurpassingbaselines.MFCwiththeE5embeddingmodel achieves the strongest BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore, while PSC and MFC with mpnet also achieve high ROUGE scores. This indicates that our chunkers yield contextually aligned outputs. 8 Authors Suppressed Due to Excessive Length Embedding Chunker BLEU ROUGE1 ROUGE2 ROUGEL BER TScore MiniLM Char28.10 30.63 13.16 22.26 87.43 Sent21.84 22.64 8.37 15.97 84.72 Sem24.73 27.19 10.67 19.75 86.57 Rec22.68 24.33 9.08 17.53 85.73 PSC24.20 27.08 10.00 19.45 86.92 MFC22.55 25.56 9.08 18.07 86.48 mpnet Char23.31 25.64 9.81 18.52 86.80 Sent23.19 25.08 9.50 17.39 86.45 Sem22.01 25.3010.5018.44 86.83 Rec20.22 23.26 8.73 16.95 84.17 PSC23.1426.9410.21 19.68 85.91 MFC23.6026.61 9.8319.71 87.38 e5 Char24.06 26.32 10.11 18.77 86.53 Sent19.42 21.66 8.32 15.14 85.92 Sem22.19 23.88 8.70 17.19 85.93 Rec22.10 24.78 10.09 18.22 86.56 PSC23.41 26.52 9.59 18.77 87.42 MFC25.34 27.68 10.31 19.94 87.46 Table 2: Evaluation metrics (BLEU, ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, and BERTScore) for different embedding models and chunking strategies. Results show Character chunking with miniLM, MFC with mpnet and E5 perform the best. The p- test values between PSC and Char across the three embeddings and five metrics were less than0.3and t-test values around than1. Evaluation reveals a mismatch between conventional metrics and actual gen- erationquality.StandardmetricslikeBLEU,ROUGE,andBERTScoreprioritize lexical overlap over semantic nuance and factual accuracy. Consequently, they fail to capture the superiority of
