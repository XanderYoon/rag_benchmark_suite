Breaking It Down: Domain-Aware Semantic Segmentation for Retrieval Augmented Generation Aparajitha Allamraju, Maitreya Prafulla Chitale, Hiranmai Sri Adibhatla, Rahul Mishra, and Manish Shrivastava International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, India Abstract.Document chunking is a crucial component of Retrieval- Augmented Generation (RAG), as it directly affects the retrieval of rel- evant and precise context. Conventional fixed-length and recursive split- ters often produce arbitrary, incoherent segments that fail to preserve semantic structure. Although semantic chunking has gained traction, its influence on generation quality remains underexplored. This paper introduces two efficient semantic chunking methods, Projected Similar- ity Chunking (PSC) and Metric Fusion Chunking (MFC), trained on PubMeddatausingthreedifferentembeddingmodels.Wefurtherpresent an evaluation framework that measures the effect of chunking on both re- trieval and generation by augmenting PubMedQA with full-text PubMed Central articles. Our results show substantial retrieval improvements (↑24x with PSC) in MRR and higher Hits@k on PubMedQA. We provide a comprehensive analysis, including statistical significance and response- time comparisons with common chunking libraries. Despite being trained on a single domain, PSC and MFC also generalize well, achieving strong out-of-domain generation performance across multiple datasets. Overall, our findings confirm that our semantic chunkers, especially PSC, consis- tently deliver superior performance.

By integrating external, domain-relevant context, RAG im- proves the factual grounding and reliability of model outputs. However, its ef- fectiveness depends heavily on the quality of the retrieval stage. A central factor in retrieval performance is chunking [2], which determines how documents are segmented for indexing. Effective chunking preserves seman- tic coherence, enabling the retrieval of contextually complete and relevant seg- ments and improving downstream tasks like question answering.
