CE +γLq CE )+ β((1−σ)Lp KL +σLq KL ). DR+ST+DLM is our multi-positive variant of DR+ST+DL. Even though DR+ST+DL simultaneously uses all the available typo variations of a qu ery in order to calculate the KL divergence losses for the prime passage retrieval Typo-Robust Dense Retrieval via Multi-positive Contrasti ve Learning 5 task and the dual query retrieval, it uses only the typo-free quer y to compute the contrastive loss for query retrieval ( Lq CE ). To fully beneﬁt from the multi- ple available typoed queries per typo-free query, we replace the co ntrastive loss for query retrieval Lq CE with a multi-positive variant that supports samples with multiple positives Lq M CE. The ﬁnal loss is computed as the weighted summation, L = (1 − β)((1 − γ)Lp CE + γLq M CE) + β((1 − σ)Lp KL + σLq KL ). 3 Experimental Setup Query augmentation. From the aforementioned methods, those employing queries with typos in their training scheme are augmentation-based . In detail, during training, the typoed queries are generated from the origina l, typo-free queries through a realistic typo generator [9]. The typo generator applies the following transformations that often occur in human-generated q ueries: random character insertion, deletion and substitution, swapping neighbor ing characters, and keyboard-based character swapping [4]. Datasets and evaluation. We conduct our experiments on MS MARCO pas- sage ranking [10] and DL-Typo [14] on their typo-free and typoed versions. Both datasets use the same underlying corpus of 8 .8 million passages and ∼ 400K training queries but diﬀer in evaluation queries. DL-Typo provides 60 real-world queries with typos alongside their manually corrected typo-free ve rsion. The development set of MS MARCO consists of 6 , 980 queries (the test set is not publicly available). Following previous works [13,14], we obtain typo
