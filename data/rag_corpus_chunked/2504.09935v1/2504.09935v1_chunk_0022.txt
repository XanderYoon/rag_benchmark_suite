in Figure 2. Compared to the uniform distribution case, the KL divergence is significantly larger and decreases more slowly as the downstream corpus size increases. For data with a Simpson diversity index approaching 1, the KL divergence reaches approximately 6. In contrast, the uniform case consistently maintains a very low KL divergence. For example, the lowest Simpson diversity index in the figure is around1𝑒 −06, which matches the magnitude of the uniform distribution, 1 220 ≈ 1𝑒 − 06, and the corresponding KL divergence is approximately 0.19, as seen in Figure 1. 212 214 216 218 220 222 224 Size of Downstream Corpus 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7KL Divergence 0.19 A = 1.00 A = 0.04 A = 3.27e □ 04 A = 1.91e □ 05 A = 1.43e □ 06 Lower Bound Figure 2: The KL divergence error in the first generation step on several synthetic relevance distribution data with differ- ent degrees of concentration.
