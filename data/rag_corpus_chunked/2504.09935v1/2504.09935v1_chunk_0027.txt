number of relevant documents, which does not exceed the number of relevant branches. Results are presented in Table 2. The recall is relatively low, indicating that branches containing highly relevant documents may not always be SIGIR ’25, July 13–18, 2025, Padua, Italy Shiguang Wu et al. retrieved within the top-𝑘 branches. However, the top-1 precision is higher, particularly for the MS MARCO-dev evaluation set. Table 2: Recall@50 and Precision@1 of relevant branches (256 in total) at the first generation step, which are denoted as “R@50” and “P@1”. The highest50 documents are labeled relevant, and the branches contain these documents are la- beled relevant. The relevance distribution is constructed in Section 7.1.

Since Zeng et al. [61] designed and trained the GR model specifically on the MS MARCO passage corpus, the docID structure is highly adapted to that query- document training distribution. Additionally, the size of the MS MARCO corpus is far from ideal for representing a complete corpus. As a result, the experimental findings only provide an approximate reflection of the theoretical results.3 8 Limitations Concerning the theoretical aspects of our work, as we do not have an evidence of what an optimal GR model should look like, we fail to provide practical assumptions on the relevance distribution and the structure of docID. Our results are sensitive to the parameters and assumptions, e.g., the sharpness of the relevance distribution for Theorem C.1, and may not accurately reflect practical real-world situations. Besides, we have not studied how the two factors affect each other when using constrained beam search.
