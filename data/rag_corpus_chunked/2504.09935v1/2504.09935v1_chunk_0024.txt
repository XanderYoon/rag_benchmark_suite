The synthetic relevance distribution is constructed as Section 4.2. The total number of sampled relevant document is 0.05𝑘. The size of each branch is fixed as 𝑛 = 225. with logit 𝑠, the score is computed as exp(𝑠/𝑇 ). Lower tempera- tures increase the gap between scores for relevant and non-relevant documents. The results are shown in Figure 4. Our findings reveal that recall performance is highly sensitive to temperature, achieving perfection within a narrow range. This confirms the advantage of constructing GR models that capture concentrated distributions effectively. 6.3 Summary The results from the synthetic data distributions validate the theo- retical findings presented in earlier sections. Although these syn- thetic settings are not practical for real-world scenarios, they pro- vide a controlled environment to clearly demonstrate the negative effects of constrained decoding and beam search. 7 Experiments on real-world dataset 7.1 Experimental setups Document identifier design. For the docID design, we adopt the codebook and semantic ID mapping from Zeng et al. [61], which introduces the first effective GR model that outperforms conven- tional retrieval models on the full MS MARCO passage corpus [3]. The codebook size is set to 256. Datasets. We evaluate our approach using the MS MARCO V1 passage corpus [3], which contains 8.8 million passages, along with three evaluation datasets: (i) MS MARCO-dev, consisting of 7k queries; (ii) TREC DL 2019 [14], with 43 queries; and (iii) TREC DL 2020 [13],
