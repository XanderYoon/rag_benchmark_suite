high probability, at least 0.15(𝑘 − 𝜆𝑘) non-relevant branches will exceed one of the low-score relevant branches. Thus at most 0.5𝜆𝑘 + max{0.5𝜆𝑘 − 0.15(𝑘 − 𝜆𝑘), 0} relevant branches will be in the top-𝜆𝑘. Then the recall is at most 0.5 + max{0.65 − 0.15/𝜆, 0}. For the top-1 precision, the maximum score of the relevant doc- uments can approach 𝛿 + Δ w.h.p. And for a normal distribution 𝑫 with mean 0 and variance 𝛿 2 = 0.8𝑛, Pr  𝑫 𝛿 ≥ 𝜖  ≤ 𝑂 ( 1 𝜖 𝑒 −𝜖 2/2). If we let 𝜖 = 𝑒Δ, we have that the probability there is a non-relevant branch exceeding by 𝑒Δ√ 0.8𝑛 is 𝑜 (1). Then w.h.p. the top-1 preci- sion is 1. □ Remark C.2. In fact, the recall will be lower than 0.5 if 𝜆 is small enough because more non-relevant branches will be much higher than the barrier. The result mainly comes from the carefully designed score of relevant documents which is linear in 𝑛. It may not hold for extremely skewed distribution of scores, e.g., the relevant score is exponentially large, which actually corresponds to the “amplification” discussed in Section 5.
