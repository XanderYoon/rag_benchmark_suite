set 𝛿 = 𝑜 (1) and 𝛿 2𝑘 = 𝑘𝑂 (1), and have 𝑑TV (𝑃, 𝑄) ≥ | 𝑃 (𝐴𝑛) − 𝑄 (𝐴𝑛)| (25) ≥ 𝑛𝑌𝑛 𝑍 − 𝑌𝑛 𝑌1 (26) ≥ (1 − 𝛿)𝑛E[𝑌𝑛] (1 + 𝛿)𝑘𝑚𝑝 − (1 + 𝛿)E[𝑌𝑛] (1 − 𝛿)E[𝑌1] (27) ≃ 1 − Φ(1)√𝑚𝑝 . (28) where 𝑑TV (𝑃, 𝑄) = sup𝐴⊆ [𝑘 ] |𝑃 (𝐴) − 𝑄 (𝐴)| is the total variation distance of two distributions. Lastly, we use Pinsker’s inequality [15] to give the asymptotic lower bound in Eq. 17, KL [𝑃 ∥ 𝑄] ≥ 2𝑑TV (𝑃, 𝑄)2 ≳ 0.05 𝑚𝑝 . □ Theorem B.2 (Lower bound of KL divergence for uniform relevance distribution.). Let 𝑟 = 𝑚 − 1 and the sampling proba- bility 𝑝 = 1 𝑘𝑟 −𝑠 . Pr(·) is a uniform distribution. We have, for the KL divergence in Eq. 7, KL [Pr(·|𝐶) ∥ Pr(·|𝐶𝑖 )] ≳ 0.05 𝑘𝑠 . (29) Here 𝑠 is small and hence the right hand side converges slowly with respect to 𝑘. When 𝑠 = 0, we have a constant lower bound 0.05. Proof. We consider each possible token𝑑1 ∈ [ 𝑘] at first position. Since the selection of each document follows Bernoulli(𝑝), the number of documents selected with first token being 𝑑1 follows Binomial(𝑘𝑟 , 𝑝). As the GR model can only consider the constraint in the current step, it will return a uniform distribution over the valid 𝑑1 tokens. By revoking Lemma B.1, we have the lower bound. □ Theorem B.3 (Lower bound of KL divergence for general relevance distribution). Let 𝑆𝑖 𝑗 be a weighted Bernoulli random variable, with parameter 𝑝 and weight 𝑤𝑖 𝑗, where 𝑖 ∈ [ 𝑘] and 𝑗 ∈ [𝑛]. Suppose for some 𝛿 > 0, {𝑆𝑖 𝑗 | 𝑗 ∈ [ 𝑛]} satisfy Lyapunov’s condition
