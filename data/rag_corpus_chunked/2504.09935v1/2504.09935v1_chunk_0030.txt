Appendix A On the magnitude of vocabulary size In this work, we use a sequence of tokens as the docID to repre- sent the document as a general case. In order for the GR model to generate the docID of relevant documents, the docID faithfully rep- resenting the semantic information is highly perfered. Therefore, the vocabulary size of the docID is a key factor to determine the capacity of the GR model. In this section, we will give a brief per- spective of its magnitude by considering the average information content in real-world documents. Bits per byte (bpb) is a widely used metric to measure the infor- mation content of a document. It is defined as the number of bits required to encode the content in a lossless way. Let𝛼 be the bpb of general English text, and 𝑛 be the length (in bytes) of a document. The information content of the document is 𝑛𝛼 bits on average. Since the vocabulary size of the GR model is 𝑘, the maximum aver- age information in a single token is log2 𝑘 bits. Each docID has 𝑚 Constrained Auto-Regressive Decoding Constrains Generative Retrieval SIGIR ’25, July 13–18, 2025, Padua, Italy tokens, so there will be𝑚 log2 𝑘 bits in total. One would expect that the information content of the docID should
