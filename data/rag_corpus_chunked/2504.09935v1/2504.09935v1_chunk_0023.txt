The synthetic relevance distribution is constructed as Section 4.2. The total number of sampled relevant document is 𝜆𝑘. The size of each branch is fixed as 𝑛 = 225. 6.2 Effects of beam search Verification of theoretical results. We first construct a sparse relevance distribution as outlined in Section 4.2. The results are presented in Figure 3. We evaluate the recall of relevant branches under varying values of 𝜆, which controls the number of relevant documents sampled. Specifically, we compute how many relevant branches are preserved in the top positions during the first gener- ation step. We also examine large 𝜆 values, which are beyond the scope of Theorem C.1. For small 𝜆, the recall performance is approximately 0.5. For larger 𝜆 values, the recall still aligns with the theoretical bounds. In all cases, the precision@1 remains consistently perfect. Regarding score magnitudes, as each branch has a fixed size of𝑛 = 225, relevant documents achieve scores around 𝑒8.6 ≈ 5400, while non-relevant documents score around 𝑒1 ≈ 2.7.
