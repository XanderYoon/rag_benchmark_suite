imple- mented using a sequence-to-sequence architecture such as T5 [43] or BART [23], generates a ranked list of the most relevant docIDs in D for the given query. The ranking list is computed through beam search during generation. To ensure the model reliably gen- erates valid docIDs from the corpus, a constrained auto-regressive decoding process 𝑔 together with the beam search is used. Bayes-optimal generative retrieval. We first assume the com- plete corpus D contains all possible documents of length 𝑚. Any downstream corpus is therefore a subset of D. We denote 𝑓 as the Bayes-optimal GR model on D which has the ability to predict the ground-truth relevance distribution over D given any query. The Bayes-optimal model 𝑓 is considered as an ideal and oracle prototype model which helps us understand the behavior of the generation process. When 𝑓 is applied to a downstream corpus D𝑐 ⊂ D , it uses the corresponding constrained decoding process 𝑔𝑐 to predict relevant documents in D𝑐. This induced GR model on Table 1: Glossary.

Note that a similar setting has recently been proposed as zero-shot indexing [2]. Notation. Table 1 lists the main notation used in the paper. For an integer 𝑛, we denote the set {1, . . . , 𝑛} by [𝑛]. We use bold face to denote random variables. Tokens in a document 𝑑 are integers from [𝑘], making 𝑑 ∈ [ 𝑘]𝑚, and 𝑘 is the vocabulary size. We set the complete
