First, we show the distribution of values for non-relevant branches. For each non-relevant branch, the score 𝑆 is the sum of 𝑛 i.i.d. random variables from 𝒀 𝑖 = 𝑒𝑿 𝑖 , where 𝑿𝑖 ∼ Uniform(−1, 1). As E[𝒀 ] ≈ 1.175, and V[𝒀 ] ≈ 0.4, we have E[𝑺] = 1.175𝑛 and V[𝑺] = 0.4𝑛. According to the central limit theorem, the distri- bution of 𝑆 is approximately N (1.175𝑛, 0.4𝑛). Therefore, for two non-relevant branches, the difference of their scores is approxi- mately N (0, 0.8𝑛), and Pr[𝑆1 − 𝑆2 ≥ √ 0.8𝑛] ≈ 0.15. Next, we estimate the number of relevant branches. As the pro- portion 𝑝 = 𝜆𝑘 𝑘𝑛 is small, and 𝑛𝑝 = 𝜆, we can approximate the number of relevant docs, #𝑹, in each branch as a Poisson distribu- tion with parameter 𝜆. Then we have Pr[#𝑹 = 0] = 𝑒 −𝜆 ≈ 1 − 𝜆, and Pr[#𝑹 = 1] = 𝜆𝑒 −𝜆 ≈ 𝜆, Therefore, there are aproximately 𝜆𝑘 relevant branches and 𝑘 − 𝜆𝑘 non-relevant branches. We consider a barrier𝐵 = 1.175𝑛 + √ 0.8𝑛 and the event that some non-relevant branches are above the barrier and half of relevant branches are below the barrier. According to the data model, with high probability, half of the relevant documents have a score below√ 0.8𝑛. Since each non-relevant branch has a probability of 0.15 to exceed another by √ 0.8𝑛, we have that, with high probability, at least 0.15(𝑘 − 𝜆𝑘) non-relevant branches will exceed one of the low-score relevant branches. Thus at most 0.5𝜆𝑘 + max{0.5𝜆𝑘 − 0.15(𝑘 − 𝜆𝑘), 0} relevant branches will be in the top-𝜆𝑘. Then the recall is at most 0.5 + max{0.65 − 0.15/𝜆, 0}. For the top-1 precision, the maximum score of the relevant doc- uments can
