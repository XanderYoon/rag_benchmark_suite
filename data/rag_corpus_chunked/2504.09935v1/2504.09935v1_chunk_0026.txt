In practice, sampling should remain agnostic to future relevance, but this analysis illustrates what occurs if the downstream corpus distribution aligns with the complete corpus. For uniform sampling, Figures 5(a) and 6(a) depict the KL di- vergence across varying complete corpus sizes. We observe that the error decreases rapidly as the size of the downstream corpus increases. For small 𝑘, the Simpson diversity index in each branch is lower due to the higher number of elements, which helps reduce the KL divergence as defined in Eq. 11. In contrast, for non-uniform sampling, Figures 5(b) and 6(b) show that the error is substantially higher than in the uniform case. Non- uniform sampling introduces greater variance and exacerbates the mismatch between distributions. 7.3 Effect of beam search We evaluate recall performance by examining the retrieval of rele- vant branches. The cutoff is set to the number of relevant documents, which does not exceed the number of relevant branches. Results are presented in Table 2. The recall is relatively low, indicating that branches containing highly relevant documents may not always be SIGIR ’25, July 13–18, 2025, Padua, Italy Shiguang Wu et al. retrieved within the top-𝑘 branches. However, the top-1 precision is higher, particularly for the
