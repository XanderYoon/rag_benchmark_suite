practitioners in the field may consider balancing the degree of concentration when designing and train- ing GR model, and using post-calibration to fix the errors when using the model on a downstream corpus. Other forms of decoding strategies beyond constrained beam search are also suggested. As to future work, we will continue to study how these results can be used for analyzing training properties of corpus-specific GR models. Incorporating learnable decoding strategies during the training of a differentiable search index may also be of interest in this field.
