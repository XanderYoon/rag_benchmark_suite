also related to the ranking performance. Several publications have showed that the cross-entropy is a bound of several commonly used metrics, e.g., Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG) and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) [8, 58] for binary relevance score. KL divergence and cross-entropy only differ by the entropy. valid first tokens, but the ground-truth should be proportional to the number of valid documents in each valid branch. Due to the variance of the sampling, the ground-truth distribution will not be exactly uniform. General relevance distribution. Following the same idea of the uniform case, we further give the result for general relevance dis- tributions. The key is the Simpson diversity index [45], which is used for measuring the degree of concentration. We introduce the average Simpson diversity index. It is computed as the squared expectation of root sum of squared probabilities Pr(𝑑 | 𝑑1), i.e., E2 𝑑1  √︄∑︁ 𝑑 Pr(𝑑 | 𝑑1)2  . (10) Recall that each document is selected with probability 𝑝, and let 𝐴 be the average Simpson diversity index, we have an asymptotic lower bound of the KL divergence for large 𝑘 in Eq. 11. KL [Pr(· | 𝐶) ∥ Pr(· | 𝐶𝑖 )] ≳ 0.05𝐴 𝑝 . (11) For detailed illustration of the proof, see Theorem B.3. We also show that the lower bound reaches its minimum in the uniform relevance distribution case. Note that we have 𝐴 ≥ 𝑘 | D |, where the equality is obtained when Pr(·) is uniform. Let the selected corpus size be 𝑘𝑟 ≈ 𝑝 |D |, we have the same error shown in Eq. 9. 0.05𝐴 𝑝 ≈ 0.05𝑘 |D |𝑝 = 0.05 𝑘𝑟 −1 . (12) Note that for concentrated distribution, the Simpson diversity index considerably exceeds 𝑝, resulting in a corresponding larger error. In conclusion, we infer
