Suppose we have 𝑘 branches, each with 𝑛 = 𝑘𝑚−1 documents (leaves). We randomly select 𝜆𝑘 docs from all branches as the relevant ones, where 𝜆 ≪ 1. We assign each non- relevant doc a score uniformly at random from [−1, 1], and each relevant doc from [𝛿 − Δ, 𝛿 + Δ], where 𝛿 = 0.5 log(0.8𝑛), and Δ = 𝑂 (0.5 log log𝑘). We then take the exponential of the score for each doc and use the sum of the scores as the ranking score for each branch. Then, we have the following results with high probability: (1) The top- 𝜆𝑘 recall is lower than 0.5 + max{0.65 − 0.15/𝜆, 0}. (2) The top- 1 precision is 1. Proof. First, we show the distribution of values for non-relevant branches. For each non-relevant branch, the score 𝑆 is the sum of 𝑛 i.i.d. random variables from 𝒀 𝑖 = 𝑒𝑿 𝑖 , where 𝑿𝑖 ∼ Uniform(−1, 1). As E[𝒀 ] ≈ 1.175, and V[𝒀 ] ≈ 0.4, we have E[𝑺] = 1.175𝑛 and V[𝑺] = 0.4𝑛. According to the central
