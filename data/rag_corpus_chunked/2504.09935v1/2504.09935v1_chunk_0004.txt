constrained beam search to generate the top-𝑘 docIDs as the default retrieval strategy [46, 47, 49, 52]. However, Zeng et al. [62] point out the pitfalls of this strategy, i.e., a greedy local search algorithm is likely to prune false negative docIDs and may thus not be suffi- cient for developing effective GR models. While these effects are typically entangled with model errors in relevance prediction, the impact of constrained beam search using a Bayes-optimal model with the correct relevance distribution still remains unclear. Within our setting, we address this gap by isolating and analyzing the theoretical root of limitations of constrained auto-regressive beam search. Main findings. We study the inherent limitations from two es- sential perspectives: constraints and beam search. (i) Constraints: In Section 4.1, we derive a lower bound on the error, in terms of the KL divergence between the ground-truth and model-predicted step-wise marginal distributions. This error is influenced by the concentration of the relevance distribution and arises from the model’s lack of awareness of future constraints during generation. (ii) Beam search: In Section 4.2, we show that the usage of marginal distributions may not be suitable. We prove that for some sparse relevance distribution with a thick tail, beam search can achieve perfect top-1 precision, but poor top-𝑘 recall performance. We are aware of existing techniques on improving recall of GR model, and summarize two directions based on our analysis: (i)aggregation, i.e., aggregating the relevant documents within a narrow branch, and (ii) amplification, i.e., amplifying the scores of relevant documents to be significantly large. Both directions are essentially meant to provide a high concentration prior on the relevance distribution. We show that although they are empirically beneficial for small scale corpus, difficulty will arise if we aim to construct a Bayes-optimal GR. Our results provide theoretical
