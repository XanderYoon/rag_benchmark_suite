half of the RGFT process, and then sees a sudden surge in capability during the second half of the RGFT pro- cess. It is worth noting that the EM performance in RuleQA-I fluctuates more dramatically: While re- alizing substantial EM performance gains (ranking second in all the benchmarks), it undergoes several upward and downward drops before levelling off at the optimal performance. This suggests that RuleQA-I is the most challenging among our con- structed five benchmarks. Moreover, from Table 2, 4 and 5, we find RuleRAG has the worst absolute performance in RuleQA-I compared to the other four benchmarks under the same LLMs, which also illustrates the challenge of the rules in RuleQA-I. 7 /uni00000014 /uni00000015 /uni00000016 /uni00000017 /uni00000056/uni00000003/uni0000000b/uni00000035/uni00000058/uni0000004f/uni00000048/uni00000003/uni00000025/uni00000044/uni00000051/uni0000004e/uni00000056/uni0000000c/uni00000003/uni00000049/uni00000052/uni00000055/uni00000003/uni00000037/uni00000055/uni00000044/uni0000004c/uni00000051/uni0000004c/uni00000051/uni0000004a /uni00000017 /uni00000016 /uni00000015 /uni00000014 /uni00000056/uni00000003/uni0000000b/uni00000035/uni00000058/uni0000004f/uni00000048/uni00000003/uni00000025/uni00000044/uni00000051/uni0000004e/uni00000056/uni0000000c/uni00000003/uni00000049/uni00000052/uni00000055/uni00000003/uni00000037/uni00000048/uni00000056/uni00000057/uni0000004c/uni00000051/uni0000004a /uni0000000e/uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000014/uni0000000e/uni0000001b/uni00000011/uni00000018/uni0000000e/uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000015/uni0000000e/uni00000014/uni00000015/uni00000011/uni00000016 /uni0000000e/uni0000001c/uni00000011/uni00000019/uni0000000e/uni0000001b/uni00000011/uni00000015/uni0000000e/uni00000014/uni00000014/uni00000011/uni00000015/uni0000000e/uni0000001c/uni00000011/uni00000018 /uni0000000e/uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000018/uni0000000e/uni00000014/uni00000014/uni00000011/uni0000001c/uni0000000e/uni0000001c/uni00000011/uni0000001a/uni0000000e/uni0000001b/uni00000011/uni0000001b /uni0000000e/uni00000014/uni00000015/uni00000011/uni0000001b/uni0000000e/uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000016/uni0000000e/uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000018/uni0000000e/uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000013 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 /uni00000003/uni00000058/uni00000051/uni00000047/uni00000048/uni00000055/uni00000003/uni00000035/uni0000002a/uni00000029/uni00000037/uni00000010/uni0000002f/uni0000002f/uni00000024/uni00000030/uni00000024/uni00000015_/uni0000001a/uni00000025 /uni0000001c /uni00000014/uni00000013 /uni00000014/uni00000014 /uni00000014/uni00000015 /uni00000028/uni00000030/uni00000003/uni00000003/uni00000053/uni00000048/uni00000055/uni00000049/uni00000052/uni00000055/uni00000050/uni00000044/uni00000051/uni00000046/uni00000048/uni00000003/uni00000003/uni0000004c/uni00000050/uni00000053/uni00000055/uni00000052/uni00000059/uni00000048/uni00000050/uni00000048/uni00000051/uni00000057 Figure 5: The EM of generalizing RuleRAG-FT from the source rule bank Ri to the target rule bank Rj , i.e., RuleRAG-FT is trained on Ri and tested on Rj. The numbers in (Ri, Rj) represent the performance gains compared to the baseline Standard RAG tested on Rj. 6 Rule Generalization Generalization on RuleQA RuleRAG-ICL is training-free, so we can attach arbitrary rules to the method’s input by in-context learning. Experimental results above naturally illus- trate its instruction-following ability to many kinds of rules. In RGFT, the constructed fine-tuning data is limited anyway but rules are inexhaustible, so RuleRAG-FT cannot and should not see the full set of rules in RuleQA. Therefore, it is important to verify its ability to generalize to unseen rules. RuleRAG-FT must capture transferable rule uti- lization capability, since RuleRAG-FT has no prior knowledge of the target rule bank and is forced to learn from the source rule bank.
