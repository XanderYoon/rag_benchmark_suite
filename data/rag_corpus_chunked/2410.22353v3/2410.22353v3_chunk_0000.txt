However, ex- isting approaches only consider the query itself, neither specifying the retrieval preferences for the retrievers nor informing the generators of how to refer to the retrieved documents for the answers, which poses a significant challenge to the QA performance. To address these issues, we propose Rule-guided Retrieval-Augmented Generation with LMs, which explicitly intro- duces rules for in-context learning (RuleRAG- ICL) to guide retrievers to recall related docu- ments in the directions of rules and uniformly guide generators to reason attributed by the same rules. The combination of queries and rules can be used as fine-tuning data to update retrievers and generators, achieving better rule- based instruction-following ability (RuleRAG- FT). Moreover, most existing RAG datasets were constructed without considering rules and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are recognized as providing high-quality rules. Therefore, we construct five rule-aware RAG benchmarks for QA, RuleQA, based on KGs to stress the signif- icance of retrieval and reasoning with rules. Ex- periments on RuleQA demonstrate RuleRAG- ICL improves the retrieval quality of +89.2% in Recall@10 and answer accuracy of +103.1% in Exact Match, and RuleRAG-FT yields more en- hancement. In addition, experiments on four ex- isting RAG datasets show RuleRAG is also ef- fective by offering rules in RuleQA to them, fur- ther proving the generalization of rule guidance in RuleRAG.
