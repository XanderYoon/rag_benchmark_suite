EM of gen- erated answers can differ significantly (12.4% vs 9.1%). The reason may be that DPR’s retrieved con- tent includes not only the correct answers but also other helpful information. RGFT further widens the gap of Reacll@k between DPR and SimCSE. Retrievers in RuleRAG-ICL Contriever (Izacard et al., 2022) is a powerful re- triever with strong unsupervised performance and can transfer well to new applications. Therefore, it has been widely used in RAG. In Table 4 in Appendix B, we note that Contriever without the guidance of rules can achieve relatively good recall and RG-Contriever makes further enhancements. Compared to Standard RAG, RuleRAG-ICL with RG-Contriever and RG-generators also obtain vary- ing degrees of performance improvement under the three LLMs. These results confirm the outstanding ability of our proposed rule-guided method. 5.3 Further Analysis on Generators More LLMs as Generators To test RuleRAG’s generalization to more gen- erators, we evaluate the effect of different LLMs in Table 5 in Appendix C. We experiment with three more open-source LLMs: ChatGLM2_6B (Du et al., 2022), Mistral_7B_v0.2 (Jiang et al., 2023a), LLAMA2_13B (Touvron et al., 2023), and a closed-source LLM, GPT-3.5-Turbo. First, consistent with the conclusions for LLAMA2_7B in Table 2, Table 5 show RuleRAG is effective under various kinds of LLMs. RuleRAG-ICL and RuleRAG-FT improve the overall performance of Standard RAG across all benchmarks and LLMs, demonstrating the validity and universality of rules. RuleRAG-FT consistently outperforms RuleRAG-ICL. Secondly, for LLAMA2 as generators, Standard RAG, RuleRAG-ICL and RuleRAG-FT with the 13B model always outperform their 7B counterparts, indicating that the introduced rules can provide better guidance when using larger models with the 1/8 2/8 3/8 4/8 5/8 6/8 7/8 1 Fine-tuning data ratio 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%EM performance ratio RuleQA-I RuleQA-Y RuleQA-W RuleQA-F RuleQA-N Figure 4: The EM variation of RuleRAG-FT
