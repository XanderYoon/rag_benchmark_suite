their rule mining algorithms can provide high-quality rules and question-answer pairs, so we construct RuleQA based on knowledge bases and equip rules to RuleQA. Rule bank R. A huge amount of world knowledge, including static facts and temporal events, has been stored in static KGs and temporal KGs (Jiang et al., 2023b). If Event1 can lead to the happening of Event2, we believe that there is a logical correlation between them. In KGs, events are usually stored in the form of triples [Entity 1, r1, Entity 2] , so we leverage a triple to stand for an event. In the static scenario, several different relations can be simultaneously established between two entities. In the temporal scenario, two entities can interact multiple times at different timestamps. Hence, if relation r1 (rule body) can logically explain the occurrence of relation r2 (rule head) between entities, we represent this relevance as rule r in a natural language form: [Entity 1, r1, Entity 2] leads to [Entity 1, r2, Entity 2] . We leverage the classical rule mining algorithm AMIE3 (Lajus et al., 2020) for static KGs and TLogic (Liu et al., 2022) for temporal KGs.AMIE3 and TLogic are currently the most widely used rule mining methods, as well as one of the best static and temporal knowledge graph mining models, respectively. Therefore, the quality of the rules is guaranteed. They can intuitively give rules with confidence scores. The frequently co-occur rela- tions form rules with high confidence (Liao et al., 2024) and we only transform these high-confidence rules to the above text string form, comprising our rule bank R, which will be consistently leveraged in the training and inferring process of RuleRAG. Test dataset Q. To avoid skewed entity distribu- tion, we include links with both popular and long- tail entities in KG
