of rules. Furthermore, the comparison results with and without rules in RuleQA for RuleRAG and CoK on existing RAG datasets also attest to the effectiveness of rules in broader scenarios. In the future, we will explore how to adapt rules in more complex RAG frame- works and use custom rules for more QA tasks. 8 Limitations Since existing RAG datasets do not have adapted rules, which have been widely used for knowledge- intensive reasoning tasks, we use mature KG rule mining algorithms to match rules for our con- structed benchmarks RuleQA. Although the ex- periments on four existing RAG datasets, includ- ing ASQA, PopQA, HotpotQA and NQ, initially demonstrated that the guideline of rules in RuleQA can be generalized to them and yielded perfor- mance gains, the gains were limited because the rules were not customized for them. Therefore, we plan to match rules for more RAG datasets and vali- date the rules on more RAG models to demonstrate the generic usefulness, since all RAG-based meth- ods involve the two basic processes of retrieval and generation.
