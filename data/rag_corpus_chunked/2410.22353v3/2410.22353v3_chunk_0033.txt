Preprint, arXiv:2101.00774. 12 A Newly Constructed Rule-aware QA Benchmarks Many real-world scenarios, such as healthcare, law and finance, rely on expert experience and the ex- pertise can be represented with symbolic rules. For example, "having certain symptoms corresponds to a certain disease, which in turn requires the use of certain medications", "certain behaviours violate certain laws, which in turn require certain penal- ties", and "when approving a loan, information such as the borrower’s debt-income ratio must be taken into account", and so on. In a broad sense, human common sense, expert experience, or regula- tions are rules and are ubiquitous in real life, but the common RAG datasets that are available today do not provide a corresponding rule base. We find that knowledge bases and their rule mining algorithms can provide high-quality rules and question-answer pairs, so we construct RuleQA based on knowledge bases and equip rules to RuleQA. Rule bank R. A huge amount of world knowledge, including static facts and temporal events, has been stored in static KGs and temporal KGs (Jiang et al., 2023b). If Event1 can lead to the happening of
