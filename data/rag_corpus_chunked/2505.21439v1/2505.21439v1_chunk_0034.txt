which is a general-domain dataset. While we demonstrate improvements across multiple general-domain benchmarks, the effectiveness of our approach in highly specialized or domain-specific retrieval tasks may require additional investigation and potential adaptation. Thirdly, although our marginal sampling strategy significantly reduces complexity, scaling the multivariate contrastive objectives to extremely large batch sizes or significantly larger model scales remains nontrivial. Future research could explore further optimization techniques to enhance scalability. A.2 Broader Impacts Potential Positive Societal Impacts. Our contributions significantly improve the capability of IR systems to accurately interpret and follow user instructions. This enhancement can lead to higher efficiency and precision in information retrieval tasks across various real-world applications, includ- ing personalized web search, educational content discovery, and knowledge-intensive professional settings. By ensuring retrieval outputs closely align with explicit user instructions, InF-IR and InF-Embed contribute to reducing user effort and frustration, thereby positively influencing user experience and productivity. Potential Negative Societal Impacts. Improved instruction-following retrieval systems could inadvertently amplify existing biases or misinformation if the training data inherently contains biased or incorrect information. Given that InF-IR and InF-Embed leverage synthetic generation techniques and LLMs trained on web-scale data, there remains a risk of propagating undesirable stereotypes or inaccuracies present in these sources. Additionally, enhanced retrieval models might facilitate misuse, such as targeted misinformation dissemination or unauthorized data retrieval, emphasizing the need for responsible deployment and continual oversight. A.3 Data Privacy and Licensing InF-IR creation relies on publicly available datasets, specifically MS MARCO and datasets from the TREC collections, each of which comes with specific licensing terms that we have strictly followed. MS MARCO is distributed under a non-commercial license, and any derived datasets, including ours, must adhere to similar terms. Researchers aiming to use InF-IR and InF-Embed should ensure compliance with the respective licenses of these original sources. Additionally, while leveraging
