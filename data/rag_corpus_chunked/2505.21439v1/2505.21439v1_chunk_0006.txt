of 104 instructions with simple binary relevance signals. Although Promptriever (Weller et al., 2025) contributes a significantly larger training set, it generates negative examples by only contrasting documents and relies extensively on an under-trained small instruction- tuned LM for quality assurance. Motivated by these limitations, we introduce InF-IR, an instruction- following IR data synthesis pipeline that systematically generates challenging negative examples by jointly contrasting instructions, queries, and documents. Moreover, InF-IR incorporates rigorous quality validation, resulting in a high-quality corpus of representative positive-negative triplets specifically designed to enhance instruction-aware contrastive learning. Instruction-Following Retrieval Models. LMs as backbones of information retrievers enable ad- hoc search systems to retrieve with user instructions when responding to complex queries (Wang et al., 2023a; Moreira et al., 2024; Su et al., 2023; Asai et al., 2023). Early attempts to incorporate instructions into retrieval systems have often relied on decoder-only LLMs, formulating the retrieval task as a specialized text generation or reranking problem. For example, FollowIR (Weller et al., 2024) fine-tunes a LM as a reranker, achieving notably better alignment with user instructions than standard bi-encoder retrievers. Additionally, GritLM (Muennighoff et al., 2024) integrates representation and generative instruction tuning into a unified decoder-style architecture, capable of handling both generative and embedding tasks simultaneously by distinguishing them through instructions. Promptriever (Weller et al., 2025) fine-tunes RepLLaMA upon query-level instruction data to improve retrieval efficiency and adaptability to diverse query instructions. In contrast to existing instruction-following IR models that rely on powerful yet inefficient and less scalable auto- regressive LMs, we hypothesize that embedding models as retrieval backbones can effectively address diverse user requests through advanced instruction-aware representation learning. 3 Passage 𝑃!
