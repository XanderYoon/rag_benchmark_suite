Researchers with limited computational resources might find reproducing or extending our dataset challenging. Secondly, our dataset primarily extends MS MARCO, which is a general-domain dataset. While we demonstrate improvements across multiple general-domain benchmarks, the effectiveness of our approach in highly specialized or domain-specific retrieval tasks may require additional investigation and potential adaptation. Thirdly, although our marginal sampling strategy significantly reduces complexity, scaling the multivariate contrastive objectives to extremely large batch sizes or significantly larger model scales remains nontrivial.
