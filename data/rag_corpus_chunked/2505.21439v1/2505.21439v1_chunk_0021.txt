Table 3 compares contrastive loss configurations (section 5.2) on the FollowIR benchmark, yielding four main insights: (i) Multivariate contrastive loss (ℓmulti P,I ) outper- forms other variants, underscoring the importance of simultaneously contrasting instructions and passages as introduced in InF-IR. Instruction contrast explicitly guides instruction understanding, while passage contrast strengthens alignment between instruction-conditioned queries and relevant passages; (ii) Multivariate objectives consistently surpass simpler univariate objectives, highlighting the necessity of jointly modeling interactions among instructions, queries, and passages to improve instruction-aware retrieval; (iii) Decoder-only models outperform encoder-only models in both re- trieval quality and instruction-following, likely due to larger parameter capacity and richer pretraining data, enabling better handling of complex instruction-based scenarios; and (iv) Joint encoding of instruction and query (concatenation) surpasses separate encoding (attention-based) , benefiting from the autoregressive modeling capabilities of decoder-only architectures. However, joint encoding complicates partial contrastive training. Thus, separately encoding instructions, queries, and passages via attention may offer a more flexible and efficient approach for future contrastive objective designs. 9 Table 4: Different designs in InF-Embed.
