differences ) . Please provide your answer in the following format : Query : < your new query > Be concise but specific enough to ensure clear differentiation . We include instruction-synthesis prompt details as follows: Instruction Synthesis Prompt – Part I You are given a document along with a search query and an instruction that retrieves this document . Document : { document } Positive Query : { query_positive } Positive Instruction : { i n s t r u c t i o n _ p o s i t i v e } Your task is to generate a NEW instruction that will lead to the creation of DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT documents . The new instruction combined with the original query needs to create documents that are easily distinguishable from the original document when evaluated . To create effective negative examples : 1. IDENTIFY KEY ELEMENTS : First , identify 2 -3 core aspects / facts / claims of the original document . 2. CREATE SEMANTIC OPPOSITES : - Your new instruction should target information that contradicts or significantly diverges from these core aspects 22 Instruction Synthesis Prompt – Part II 3. MAINTAIN DOMAIN RELEVANCE : Stay in a similar subject area but with crucial differences : - Change time periods , locations , entities , or outcomes - Reverse cause - effect relationships - Switch perspective ( e . g . , benefits vs . drawbacks , support vs . opposition ) - Modify the granularity or specificity level 4. ENSURE CLEAR DISTINCTION : A human evaluator should be able to easily determine which document is the original vs . synthetic based on these key distinctions . The goal is that when your NEW instruction is used with the ORIGINAL query , they should produce documents that
