Figure 1: Example of original information retrieval compared to instruction-following retrieval. Information retrieval (IR) systems play an important role in efficiently accessing relevant information from vast document collections (Robertson et al., 1995; Karpukhin et al., 2020). Despite notable advancements, conventional retrieval models often struggle to accurately interpret and align with specific user requests, retrieving information based primarily on lexical or semantic matching while overlooking nuanced intents explicitly expressed in complex user queries (Figure 1). Modern language ∗Equal contribution. Preprint. arXiv:2505.21439v1 [cs.CL] 27 May 2025 models (LMs) serving as the backbones of retrieval systems has demonstrated strong potential to incorporate instruction-following capabilities (Ouyang et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023b), enabling retrievers to understand and respond accurately to a diverse set of user requests (Su et al., 2023; Asai et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2024). Instruction-following IR has emerged as an effective paradigm for explicitly guiding retrieval systems through detailed user instructions (Weller et al., 2024, 2025; Muennighoff et al., 2024), thereby enhancing retrieval accuracy and user satisfaction. In a standard instruction-following IR framework, detailed user instructions are incorporated alongside queries to condition the retrieval process (Weller et al., 2024; Oh et al., 2024). However, embedding models typically struggle with effectively interpreting and following detailed instructions; conversely, modern decoder-only LMs inherently lack robust representation learning capabilities, inadequately capturing the complex interactions among instructions, queries, and documents (Xiao et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2022a; Izacard et al., 2021). This fundamental dilemma underscores the pressing need for an effective embedding-based instruction-aware retrieval model that simultaneously excels in both efficiently encoding and accurately interpreting complex instruction-query-passage interactions. Addressing this challenge requires high-quality
