long-standing dilemma between the efficiency of auto-regressive LMs and instruction adherence of embedding models. Extensive experi- ments demonstrated that InF-Embed substantially outperforms state-of-the-art instruction-following retrieval baselines, showcasing robust instruction-following capabilities, superior scalability, de- ployment efficiency, and broad applicability in diverse IR including RAG scenarios. InF-Embed demonstrates robust improvement in instruction-following capabilities across multiple retrieval benchmarks, achieving substantial performance gains for both embedding-based (+9.0 p-MRR) and auto-regressive language models (+4.2 p-MRR). In addition, we provide a systematic benchmarking of contrastive learning objectives across various model architectures and sizes, establishing best practices that will accelerate the development of next-generation instruction-following retrieval systems. An important line of future work is to extend InF-IR and InF-Embed to reasoning-intensive retrieval models (Chen et al., 2025; Jin et al., 2025; Guan et al., 2025) in instruction-following IR.
