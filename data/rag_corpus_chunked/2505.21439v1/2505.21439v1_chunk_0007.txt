We begin by formulating a ranking-based noise contrastive estima- tion (NCE) objective (Ma & Collins, 2018; Gutmann & Hyvärinen, 2010; Henderson et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2019) from a conditional modeling perspective. Specifically, consider a model that estimates a conditional distribution P(y | x), where x and y represent arbitrary combinations of target variables. We define a scoring function sθ (x, y) parameterized by learnable parameters θ, quantifying the relevance between a given pair (x, y). Given a training set D = {xi, yi}n i=1 and an arbitrary minibatch B ⊆ D 2 sampled during training, we introduce a predefined negative sampling distribution P− B (·) for generating negative examples within each minibatch. The resulting NCE objective using in-batch negatives is formulated as follows: ℓNCE(θ) = −Ei∼B " log exp (sθ (xi, yi))P yk∼P− B (y) exp (sθ (xi, yk)) # . (1) Dense Passage Retrieval with Instructions. Consider a corpus P = {Pi}N i=1 comprising a large set of candidate retrieval passages. Given a query Q paired with an instruction I provided by the user, an instruction-following retrieval model aims to retrieve a concise subset of passages from P that best satisfies the instruction and query. We denote this targeted positive subset as P
