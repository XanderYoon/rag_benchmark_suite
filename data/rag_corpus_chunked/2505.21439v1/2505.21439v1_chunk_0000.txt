We introduce InF-IR, a large-scale, high-quality training corpus tailored for enhancing retrieval models in Instruction-Following IR. InF-IR expands tradi- tional training pairs into over 38,000 expressive <instruction,query,passage> triplets as positive samples. In particular, for each positive triplet, we generate two additional hard negative examples by poisoning both instructions and queries, then rigorously validated by an advanced reasoning model (o3-mini) to ensure semantic plausibility while maintaining instructional incorrectness. Unlike existing corpora that primarily support computationally intensive reranking tasks, the highly con- trastive positive-negative triplets in InF-IR further enable efficient representation learning to facilitate direct embedding-based retrieval. Using this corpus, we train InF-Embed, an instruction-aware Embedding model optimized through contrastive learning and instruction-query attention mechanisms to align retrieval outcomes precisely with user intents. Extensive experiments across multiple instruction- based retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that InF-Embed significantly improves the instruction-following capability for both embedding-based (+9.0 p-MRR) and auto-regressive language models (+4.2 p-MRR) across different model sizes. 1 Introduction Query Deforestationand urbanizationresult in increased emissions, urban heat island effects ...Positive DocumentRelevance:Semantic MatchingTraditional Information RetrievalFind an optimistic and positivedoc to the query.
