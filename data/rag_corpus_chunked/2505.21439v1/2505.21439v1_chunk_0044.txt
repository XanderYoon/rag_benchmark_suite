configurations (Section 5.2) with detailed comparisons on the FollowIR dataset. Our key observations are as follows: • Contrastive Loss. Models trained with ℓmulti P,I achieve the highest performance. This result highlights the critical role of simultaneously contrasting instructions and passages: instruction contrasts enable the model to understand their guiding function, while passage contrasts reinforce the alignment between instruction-aware queries and relevant passages. • Univariate vs. Multivariate Loss. Empirical results demonstrate clear advantages of multivariate contrastive objectives over simpler univariate objectives, including those used by Promptriever (Weller et al., 2025). The superior performance emphasizes the importance of jointly modeling the interactions among instructions, queries, and passages. • Encoder-Only vs. Decoder-Only Models. Our experiments reveal that decoder-only models consistently outperform encoder-only models in retrieval effectiveness and instruction-following tasks. We attribute this improvement primarily to the increased parameter capacity and extensive pre-training data utilized in large language model training phases.
