Retrieval with Instructions. Consider a corpus P = {Pi}N i=1 comprising a large set of candidate retrieval passages. Given a query Q paired with an instruction I provided by the user, an instruction-following retrieval model aims to retrieve a concise subset of passages from P that best satisfies the instruction and query. We denote this targeted positive subset as P + = {P + j }M j=1, where M ≪ N, and correspondingly define the negative set asP − = P \P +. During training, we adopt the NCE to approximate the conditional distribution P(P +|I, Q) for the retriever model parameterized by θ, initiating by defining x = P and y = (I, Q). Specifically, the objective encourages aligning representations of matching instruction-query-passage triplets (P +, I, Q), while simultaneously promoting separation of representations corresponding to non-matching triplets (P −, I, Q). In the retrieval phase, the learned scoring function sθ(P, I, Q) quantifies the similarity between candidate passages P and instruction-query pairs (I, Q). Instructions I provide essential supplementary context, specifying various retrieval dimensions such as formatting, stylistic preferences, passage length, or user-specific details such as background knowledge or profiles (Weller et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2022b; Oh et al., 2024). By incorporating instructions, the retrieval model flexibly adapts to diverse user intents, thereby enhancing personalization and utility of retrieved passages P +. 4 InF-IR: Instruction-Following Information Retrieval Training Corpus 4.1 Data Curation In this section, we present InF-IR, a large-scale training corpus specifically curated for training a bi-encoder retrieval model capable of effectively following instructions. To ensure generalizability, we utilize MS MARCO (Bajaj et al., 2018) as our seed dataset to construct corresponding<instruction, query, passage> tuples.3 MS MARCO provides a large-scale, general-domain dataset consisting of anonymized real-world queries paired with human-annotated relevant passages.
