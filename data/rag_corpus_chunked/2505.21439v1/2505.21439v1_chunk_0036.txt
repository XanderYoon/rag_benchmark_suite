B InF-IR: Additional Data Curation Details B.1 Additional Data Quality Checks Beyond the quality assurance steps described in Section 4.1, we employ a rule-based filtering step to further enhance sample quality. Specifically, we truncate synthetic instructions and queries at the first occurrence of a newline character (\n), ensuring the removal of irrelevant or extraneous text. B.2 Additional Data Sources While the primary InF-IR builds upon MS MARCO, we are also extending our curation approach to additional datasets, including TREC Robust 2004 (V oorhees, 2004), Leetcode, and MetaMath (Yu et al., 2023). For Robust 2004, we utilize the identical data curation process applied to MS MARCO. In the case of Leetcode and MetaMath, queries are derived from problem descriptions, while passages correspond to their respective solutions. Synthetic instructions for Leetcode explicitly include the programming language and specify the intended technical solution approach. For MetaMath problems, instructions emphasize the mathematical strategy or method. When generating negative examples for Leetcode, we ensure the programming language (e.g., Python, Java, C++) remains constant between positive and negative instructions to prevent the model from relying solely on language cues to differentiate samples. All other data curation procedures remain consistent across datasets.
