K-RagRec framework. 2 Related Work Recently, RAG has emerged as one of the most representative technologies in the field of genera- tive AI, combining the strengths of retrieval sys- tems and language models (LM) to produce co- herent and informative text. Early methods, such as REALM (Guu et al., 2020), RETRO (Borgeaud et al., 2022), and DPR (Karpukhin et al., 2020), typ- ically involve retrieving relevant fragments from a large corpus to guide the LM generation. However, standard RAG methods often struggle to accurately retrieve all relevant textual chunks, due to unnec- essary noise and even harmful disturbance in the documents. To address these limitations, recent studies (Baek et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023b; He et al., 2024; Luo et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023; Sen et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023) focus on re- trieving structured and faithful knowledge from graphs for enhancing generations. For example, Retrieve-Rewrite-Answer (Wu et al., 2023b) re- trieves relevant sub-graphs from KG and converts retrieved sub-graphs into text for the generation. G-Retriever (He et al., 2024) explores retrieving sub-graphs from various types of graphs to alleviate the hallucinations of LLM. With the explosion of LLMs in recommenda- tions, a few works (Di Palma, 2023; Wu et al., 2024; Ang et al., 2024) make initial explorations in RAG for recommendations. For instance, the work (Di Palma, 2023) proposes leveraging knowl- edge from movie or book datasets to enhance rec- ommendations. Nevertheless, retrieving faithful structured knowledge from the KGs for recommen- dations is under-explored and shows great potential. To fill this gap, we propose to retrieve knowledge sub-graphs from KGs to enhance the recommenda- tion performance of LLM.
