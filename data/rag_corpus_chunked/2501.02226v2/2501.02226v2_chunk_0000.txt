The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has yielded remarkable achievements, demon- strating their potential for the development of next-generation recommender systems. De- spite these advancements, LLM-based recom- mender systems face inherent limitations stem- ming from their LLM backbones, particularly issues of hallucinations and the lack of up-to- date and domain-specific knowledge. Recently, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has garnered significant attention for addressing these limitations by leveraging external knowl- edge sources to enhance the understanding and generation of LLMs. However, vanilla RAG methods often introduce noise and neglect structural relationships in knowledge, limiting their effectiveness in LLM-based recommenda- tions. To address these limitations, we propose to retrieve high-quality and up-to-date structure information from the knowledge graph (KG) to augment recommendations. Specifically, our approach develops a retrieval-augmented framework, termed K-RagRec, that facilitates the recommendation generation process by in- corporating structure information from the ex- ternal KG. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. 1 Introduction Recommender systems, as techniques designed to assist people in making decisions in their daily lives, are increasingly gaining impact in various fields (Kenthapadi et al., 2017; He et al., 2020; Fan et al., 2019), such as online shopping, job matching, and social media. Recently, Large Lan- guage Models (LLMs) have achieved significant *Corresponding authors (c) KG RAG for LLM Recommendation User (b) Lack of Knowledge LLM (a) Hallucinations I have watched {Godfather}
