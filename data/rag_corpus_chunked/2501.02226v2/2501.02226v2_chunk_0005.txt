generation in the era of LLMs. Specifically, our proposed framework first performs knowledge sub-graph indexing on the items’ KG at a coarse and fine granularity to con- struct the knowledge vector database. Next, a pop- ularity selective retrieval policy is designed to de- termine which items should be retrieved, followed by the retrieval of specific sub-graphs from the knowledge vector database. To refine the quality of retrieval and ensure the most relevant results are prioritized at the top of the input, we subsequently re-rank the retrieved knowledge sub-graphs. Fi- nally, we introduce a GNN and projector to align the retrieved knowledge sub-graphs into the seman- tic space of the LLM for knowledge-augmented recommendation. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: • We propose a novel framework that retrieves faithful knowledge from KGs to augment the recommendation capability of LLM. Note that we introduce a flexible indexing method for KGs, which can provide a comprehensive view of a node’s neighborhood within KG. • We design a popularity selective retrieval strat- egy to determine whether an item needs to be retrieved based on its popularity, significantly improving efficiency. • We introduce a more expressive graph encoder for structured data inclusion in LLMs, that can fa- cilitate the LLM to effectively leverage the struc- ture information and avoid long context input. • We conduct comprehensive experiments on vari- ous real-world datasets to evaluate the effective- ness of the proposed K-RagRec framework. 2 Related Work Recently, RAG has emerged as one of the most representative technologies in the field of genera- tive AI, combining the strengths of retrieval sys- tems and language models (LM) to produce co- herent and informative text.
