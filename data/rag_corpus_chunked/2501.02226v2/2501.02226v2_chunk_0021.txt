small value, only a few items are augmented. This leads to insufficient retrieval and poor recommendation accuracy. When p is set to a larger value, more items are retrieved for augmen- tation. However, due to the re-ranking sub-graph numbers N being fixed, some retrieved cold-start item knowledge sub-graphs are discarded or ranked at the back of the list, resulting in sub-optimal rec- ommendation performance. On the other hand, as observed in Figure 4 (c), the inference time in- creases almost linearly with threshold p. Therefore, selecting an appropriate threshold p is crucial to balance the performance and inference time. 2) Impact of retrieved knowledge sub-graph numbers K and re-ranking sub-graph numbers N: In this part, we analyze the impact of two key hyper parameters, which are retrieved knowledge sub-graph numbers K and re-ranking sub-graph numbers N. First, to measure the impact of K, we perform experiments on the MovieLens dataset and fix p = 50%, N = 5. As shown in Figure 5, some relevant knowledge sub-graphs may be overlooked when K = 1. On the other hand, larger values ofK can introduce irrelevant information. Therefore, we set K equal to 3 in our experiments. Next, we eval- uate the effect ofN by fixing p = 50% and K = 3, and present the results in Figure 6. We observe that setting N to between 5 and 7 results in improved performance on the Amazon Book dataset. In gen- eral, it is important to carefully choose K and N based on the scale of the dataset and the KG. 5 Conclusion In this paper, we propose a novel framework K- RagRec to augment the recommendation capabil- ity of LLMs by retrieving reliable and up-to-date knowledge from KGs. Specifically, we first intro- duce a GNN and PLM to perform semantic index-
