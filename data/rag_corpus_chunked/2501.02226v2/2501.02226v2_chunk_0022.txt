it is important to carefully choose K and N based on the scale of the dataset and the KG. 5 Conclusion In this paper, we propose a novel framework K- RagRec to augment the recommendation capabil- ity of LLMs by retrieving reliable and up-to-date knowledge from KGs. Specifically, we first intro- duce a GNN and PLM to perform semantic index- ing of KGs, enabling both coarse and fine-grained retrieval for KGs. To further improve retrieval effi- ciency, we introduce a popularity selective retrieval policy that determines whether an item needs to be retrieved based on its popularity. Notably, K- RagRec performs more expressive graph encoding of the retrieved knowledge sub-graphs, facilitat- ing the LLM to effectively leverage the structure information and avoid long context input. Exten- sive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our pro- posed framework. 6 Limitations To the best of our knowledge, this work is a pioneer- ing study in investigating knowledge-graph RAG for LLM-based recommendations. Therefore, we realise that this work still has the following three main limitations that can be improved in the future research: • Firstly, due to the GPU resource constraints, we were only able to evaluate our framework on 7b and 8b models. Therefore, in future work, we plan to extend our method to larger models to fully assess its effectiveness and scalability. • Additionally, we only utilize Freebase as the ex- ternal KG as it is most commonly used for recom- mendation tasks. Thus we also aim to adopt other KGs, such as YAGO, DBpedia, and Wikipedia, to better understand how different knowledge sources impact the performance of the proposed method. • Lastly, designing an intelligent selective retrieval policy for LLM-based recommender systems is an important and challenging task. In this work, we propose to leverage popularity
