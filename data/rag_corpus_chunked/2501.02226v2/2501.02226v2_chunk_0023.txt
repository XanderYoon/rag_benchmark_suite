commonly used for recom- mendation tasks. Thus we also aim to adopt other KGs, such as YAGO, DBpedia, and Wikipedia, to better understand how different knowledge sources impact the performance of the proposed method. • Lastly, designing an intelligent selective retrieval policy for LLM-based recommender systems is an important and challenging task. In this work, we propose to leverage popularity to determine which items to retrieve to improve retrieval effi- ciency. In the future, we will investigate more flexible mechanisms (e.g., reinforcement learn- ing) to dynamically update policies according to changes in user interest. 7 Acknowledgements The research described in this paper has been partly supported by General Research Funds from the Hong Kong Research Grants Council (project no.
