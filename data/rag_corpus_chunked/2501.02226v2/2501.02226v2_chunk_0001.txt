Especially with the suc- cess of LLMs, recommender systems have seen rapid growth (Geng et al., 2022; Bao et al., 2023; Qu et al., 2024). By training on a wide range of data, LLMs (e.g., GPT-4 (Achiam et al., 2023) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023)) are able to acquire extensive knowledge and demonstrate ex- ceptional language understanding capability. This capability enables LLM-based recommender sys- tems to capture user preferences through a nu- anced understanding of relevant attributes (e.g., user profiles, item descriptions, historical inter- actions) for more accurate recommendations. As a result, LLM-based recommender systems have emerged as a new
