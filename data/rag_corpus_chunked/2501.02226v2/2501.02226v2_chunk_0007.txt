faithful structured knowledge from the KGs for recommen- dations is under-explored and shows great potential. To fill this gap, we propose to retrieve knowledge sub-graphs from KGs to enhance the recommenda- tion performance of LLM. We provide more com- prehensive related work on Appendix A.3. 3 Methodology In this section, we first introduce some key nota- tions and concepts in this work. Then, we provide the details for each component of our proposed framework K-RagRec. 3.1 Preliminary Knowledge Graph: In this work, we propose to leverage external knowledge databases (i.e., KGs) to augment LLMs for recommendations. KGs con- tain abundant factual knowledge in the form of a set of triples: G = {(n, e, n′) | n, n′ ∈ N , e ∈ E}, where N and E denote the set of entities and relations, respectively. For example, a triple Interstellar directed_by − − − − − − − →N olan indicates that the movie "Interstellar" was directed by the direc- tor "Nolan". LLM-based Recommendations: Let U = {u1, u2, . . . , un} and V = {v1, v2, . . . , vm} repre- sent the sets of users and items, where n and m are the sizes of users and items, respectively. The goal of an LLM-based recommender system is to under- stand users’ preferences by modeling users’ histor- ical items interactions V ui = [vui 1 , vui 2 , · · · , vui |Lui |] (e.g., clicks, bought, etc.), where |Lui| is interac- tion sequence length for user ui. Notably, item vj’ side information, such as title and description, is publicly available to enhance LLM for model- ing user preferences. In our setting, we consider asking the LLM to select user u’s preferred item v from the candidate set C = {vj}M j=1, where
