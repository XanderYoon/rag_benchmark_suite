layer and its upper-layer knowledge, with limited but necessary cross-layer requirements. The knowledge at the target layer can provide about 60% to 80% of the content in the answer. • 2: Relatively Low, the answer requires the collaboration of multiple layers to support, especially relying on the adjacent upper and lower layers. Any missing key layer will lead to an incomplete answer. The knowledge at the target layer can provide about 35% to 60% of the content in the answer. • 1: Very Low, all or most layers of knowledge must be integrated to provide an accurate answer. The construction of the answer relies on a complete information chain from the raw data to the abstract layer. This is usually related to broader significant events or complex knowledge, and needs to be explored throughout the knowledge base architecture. The knowledge at the target layer can provide about 5% to 35% of the content in the answer. 7.semantic depth:Evaluate the complexity, abstraction and reasoning depth of the query to determine whether multi-step reasoning or cross-domain knowledge integration is required and predict the semantic depth of the query (ranging from 1 to 5, type as Int). • Caution: If you decide to set the semantic depth to 1, do so with caution as it may result in some relevant content being omitted in the subsequent search. 25 IGMiRAG: Intuition-Guided Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Adaptive Mining of In-Depth Memory F.3.
