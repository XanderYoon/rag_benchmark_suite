space.Local Indexingconstructs separate HNSW subgraphs IL for vectors of each type in {N,L,H} . Searching within these type-homogeneous neighborhoods could provide targeted supplements to the global candidates. 3.3. Query Parsing User queries imply high-level strategic cues that integrate surface semantics with task-specific features (e.g., evalua- tive focus and response difficulty). To exploit these cues, IGMiRAG employs an LLM-based RSP that simulates in- tuitive judgment. Beyond generating standard outputs, in- cluding the rewritten query (NQ), key entities (KE), and query intent (QI ), the RSP explicitly extracts two implicit signals. These signals provide fine-grained control over the subsequent retrieval and reasoning pathways. Target Layer l and Matching Score m.The RSP predicts the knowledge layerl∈ {N,L,H} most critical for answer- ing and assigns a coverage score m∈[1,5]∩Z reflecting the comprehensiveness of the query regarding that layer. The (l,m) pair directs target-layer selection and modulates the global–local weighting during dual-focus retrieval. Semantic Depth d.The RSP analyzes NQ to estimate complexity, abstraction, and inference depth, producing a semantic depth d∈[1,5]∩Z . The depth determines the number of diffusion iterations and the context-window size. By decomposing the query into a multidimensional retrieval strategy, the RSP shifts retrieval from a passive, static pro- cess to an active, strategy-guided one, providing an inter- pretable and quantifiable basis for adaptive deep mining. 3.4. Intuitive Anchors Retrieval 3.4.1. MULTI-CHANNEL RECALL Keywords Matching.Using the KE and QI produced by the RSP, IGMiRAG forms a composite query via term concatenation. BM25 matching is subsequently applied to the name field of all knowledge units, with the resulting candidatesC BM25 ranked by descending BM25 score. 4 IGMiRAG: Intuition-Guided Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Adaptive Mining of In-Depth Memory Dual-Focus Vector Retrieval (DF-Retrieval).Beyond key- word matching, IGMiRAG employs a dual-focus semantic retrieval mechanism. Guided by the target layerl and match- ing score m provided by the
