from Nigeria, and he was born in the Delta State region...Looking at the provided data, the entry for “CHIEF JUSTICE OF DELTA STATE” indicates the head of the judiciary in that jurisdiction, which previously mentioned was Daisy W. Okocha, noted as the first female Chief Judge of Rivers State. However, to clarify, the term “chief judge” often refers to a similar position within the context of a state or court...If Daisy W. Okocha’s term overlapssignificantly or continues dominantly as recognized, then it would typically provide context upon which current legal proceedings reflect. The assertion can be made that Daisy W. Okocha or someone explicitly listed in the database would fulfill the role, thus needing the reference for the title within Delta pursuits distinctly. Answer:Chief Judge of Delta State (Daisy W. Okocha was significant historically). Figure 11.A Case Study on Multi-Hop Reasoning Task. we randomly sampled 1,000 queries from each validation set. These benchmarks primarily feature complex multi-hop questions that obscure target entities through multiple layers of relational embedding, thereby challenging both vector and keyword-based retrieval methods. Mix and Pathology:We further refined the question generation methodology employed in Hyper-RAG and Cog-RAG. Consecutive, lengthy text segments were fed into an LLM, with instructions to generate 100 questions per reasoning hop (ranging from 1 to 3 hops) along with corresponding standard answers in the form of paragraph-level descriptions. We then randomly sampled 100 question-answer (QA) pairs to construct benchmarks with diverse hop counts. These benchmarks are designed to evaluate knowledge-explanation tasks that require extensive descriptive responses, necessitating models to integrate information across multiple contexts and produce coherent, detailed explanations. The prompt templates used for QA pair generation are provided in Appendix F.4. D.3. Metrics For detail-capture and multi-hop tasks, short-form outputs are evaluated using exact match (EM) and F1 scores computed directly against
