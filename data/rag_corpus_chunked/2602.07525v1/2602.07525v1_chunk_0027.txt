PABD Algorithm To clearly elucidate the internal mechanisms of the PABD algorithm, we present a complete workflow example in Figure 7, and provide corresponding pseudocode in Algorithm 1. The PABD algorithm follows an alternating inference rule of “top-down broadcasting and bottom-up screening”. Starting from the memory anchors, it performs bidirectional diffusion across knowledge levels at each iteration, enabling the deductive propagation of relevance scores. Specifically, the score propagation
