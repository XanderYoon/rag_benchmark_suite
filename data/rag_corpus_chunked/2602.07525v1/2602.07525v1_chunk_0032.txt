core pieces of information—“Ritika’s father’s name” and “the film’s screenwriter”—while introducing irrelevant descriptions and factual inaccuracies absent from the gold standard. More severely, Hyper-RAG fails to address the film’s core plot (e.g., “the conflict between Prabhu and Rithika’s father”), instead generating extensive abstract summaries. This deficiency stems from Hyper-RAG’s diffusion process lacking relevance constraints, causing retrieved fragments to deviate significantly from the query. Consequently, the model is forced to produce vacuous, hallucinatory summaries driven by noise. D. Experiment Details D.1. Baselines A comparative analysis was conducted against state-of-the-art and widely adopted RAG methods. Details regarding these baselines are provided below. NaiveRAG(Lewis et al., 2020): This baseline method segments the source text into fine-grained chunks. Each chunk is then embedded into a vector representation and stored in a vector database. During the retrieval phase, the system identifies the most similar vectors and concatenates the corresponding chunks to construct the final context. LightRAG(Guo et al., 2024): A standard graph-enhanced RAG method. It leverages graph structures to capture pairwise relationships among knowledge units, storing both entities and relations as vectors in two separate databases. The method employs a two-stage retrieval strategy: first, it retrieves entity and relation candidates based on vector similarity; next, it explores the graph starting from these candidates, gathering adjacent nodes and edges to form the final retrieved context. PathRAG(Chen et al., 2025a): A graph-enhanced RAG method that employs a flow-control pruning mechanism. It constructs its index identically to LightRAG. During retrieval, the system first identifies candidate entities and relations via keyword search. Subsequently, the flow-control pruning mechanism retains only the most relevant paths, with the final result comprising the sequence of entities and relations along these paths. NodeRAG(Xu et al., 2025): A graph-enhanced RAG method that operates on heterogeneous graphs. It employs such a graph structure to uniformly model
