sively to preserve source-text mapping. The internal struc- tures ofN,L, andHare uniformly formalized as follows: N=  ⟨Na N i ,De N i ,A N i ⟩ |N | i=1, L=  ⟨Na L j ,De L j ,A L j ⟩ |L| j=1,(3) H=  ⟨Na H k ,De H k ,A H k ⟩ |H| k=1, where Na, De, and A denote thename,semantic descrip- tion, andadditional informationof knowledge memories respectively. For L and H, uniqueness is ensured by con- catenating the associated entity names in a fixed order. 3.2.2. DUAL-FOCUSINDEX The Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) algo- rithm (Malkov & Yashunin, 2018) is employed to construct a semantic-vector index for knowledge memories. Notably, within the unified semantic space of the HHHG, single-pass global approximate nearest-neighbor retrieval is prone to cross-type semantic drift. This occurs when vectorially proximate yet typologically irrelevant units introduce false positives, thereby degrading recall precision. To mitigate this drift, IGMiRAG introducesDF-Index, a dual-focus in- dexing library that operationalizes the intuitive focus within queries through local indexing over type-specific features. The specific construction process is as follows: IG = HNSW({De N ,De L,De H}),(4) 3 IGMiRAG: Intuition-Guided Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Adaptive Mining of In-Depth Memory Documents Books Reports Chunk 1 Chunk 2 Chunk 3 Chunk n ...
