These benchmarks are designed to evaluate knowledge-explanation tasks that require extensive descriptive responses, necessitating models to integrate information across multiple contexts and produce coherent, detailed explanations. The prompt templates used for QA pair generation are provided in Appendix F.4. D.3. Metrics For detail-capture and multi-hop tasks, short-form outputs are evaluated using exact match (EM) and F1 scores computed directly against reference answers. In contrast, knowledge explanation tasks involve open-ended, long-form responses that cannot be reliably assessed via string matching. To address this, we adopt the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm: for each instance, the question, reference answer, and model-generated response are jointly fed into an LLM, which is prompted to score the output in terms of EM, precision, and recall—based on which F1 is then calculated. Detailed evaluation prompt templates are provided in Appendix F.4. Across all benchmarks, we record the total token consumption of the model and normalize it 19 IGMiRAG: Intuition-Guided Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Adaptive Mining of In-Depth Memory ὖECase study on Knowledge Explanation –Knowledge Explanation– Question:What is the significance of Manimaran’s directorial debut Udhayam NH4 in understanding the themes of youthful rebellion and familial conflict in Tamil cinema, and how does the character development of Prabhu reflect these themes during the narrative? Gold Answer:Udhayam NH4 marks the directorial debut of Manimaran in the Tamil film industry, recognized for its narrative that centers on youthful rebellion and the pursuit of love amidst adversity, reflecting the changes in the protagonist’s character throughout the storyline.
