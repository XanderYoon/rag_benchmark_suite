hierarchical hyperedges model deductive pathways. This design establishes a foun- dation for efficient, human-like retrieval. In response to specific tasks (Stage2−Stage4 in Figure 1), humans rapidly activate experiential memories to form intu- ition, determining strategies and locating key memory an- chors. Strategy-guided reasoning then proceeds along hier- archical deductive pathways. This association is inherently bidirectional: top-down (broadcast) activates subordinate low-order memories to enrich details, whereas bottom-up (screening) integrates shared high-order memories to dis- till abstraction. This enables efficient, in-depth reasoning within hierarchical repositories, facilitating precise deci- sions. Inspired by this, IGMiRAG introduces a two-stage retrieval paradigm. First, it analyzes the query to generate an intuitive strategy, guiding the entire retrieval process. Subse- quently, it executes preference-aware bidirectional diffusion based on activated anchors, thereby mining deep memories. Our main contributions are as follows: • Better Memory Architecture: We propose a Hier- archical Heterogeneous Hypergraph to model multi- granular knowledge, capturing deductive associations via hierarchical hyperedges. This architecture emulates human memory hierarchy, enabling interpretable and efficient retrieval. • Efficient Retrieval Paradigm: We introduce an intuition-inspired “Strategy-Diffusion” two-stage re- trieval paradigm. By first generating an intuitive strat- egy to guide the depth and scope of memory access, followed by anchor-based associative diffusion, this paradigm significantly improves both precision and efficiency with lower retrieval cost. • In-Depth Reasoning Mechanism: We design a preference-aware bidirectional diffusion algorithm. By performing adaptive mining from anchors along the deductive pathways, it integrates top-down detail en- richment and bottom-up abstraction to support deep reasoning and significantly improve decision accuracy. Evaluations on six benchmarks show IGMiRAG outper- forms the state-of-the-art baseline by 4.8% EM and 5.0% F1 on average, with token costs adapting to task difficulty. These results validate that by mimicking intuition-guided reasoning, our approach improves efficiency while simulta- neously enhancing memory precision and reasoning depth, offering a viable
