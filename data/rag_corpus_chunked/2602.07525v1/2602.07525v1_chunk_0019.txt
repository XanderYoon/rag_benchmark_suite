yields a significant performance improvement for IGMiRAG. Retrieval Ablation.Both BM25 and DF-Retrieval improve initial candidates quality, with the latter yielding larger gains. Ablating local semantic retrieval alone reduces EM by4.1% 7 IGMiRAG: Intuition-Guided Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Adaptive Mining of In-Depth Memory and F1 by 3.7%. Three global-only ablations further con- firm this: while IG T op−20 outperforms IG T op−10, it matches the performance of Dynamic IG (which reallocates the local retrieval budget to the global while maintaining the same T opk as DF-Retrieval) yet consuming 0.3 k+ extra tokens. This indicates that expanding global candidates in- troduces redundancy and inefficiency. In contrast, the local perspective injects targeted units atop the global candidates, effectively offsetting the diminishing returns of scale. Diffusion Ablation.Removing the PABD module results in answering based solely on initial retrieval, consuming only 4.4 k+ tokens. In contrast, dropping the dynamic threshold mechanism degrades diffusion into indiscriminate expan- sion, amplifying high-order noise with longer texts. Conse- quently, this ablation suffers a worse performance drop than removing the preference-aware mechanism alone, despite the higher costs. Crucially, across all ablations, degrading the diffusion process proves less detrimental than impairing retrieval quality. This confirms that low-quality seeds steer diffusion along false paths, ultimately amplifying errors. 0.299 0.302 0.3110.320.330.3240.322 0.324 0.317 4 5 6123kc ku 0.29900.30520.31140.31760.32380.3300EM (%) (a)Amplification Coefficients 30.43332.731.6 6 12 18 24272829303132333435 4.55.05.56.06.57.07.58.0Avg.
