It is not allowed for two sets to have an intersection that is nearly the same as the sets themselves. For each entities set, extract the following information: - entities set:List every member entity exactly as named in Step 1. - relationship description:Based on the relationships among the entities in the set, describe the relevant content represented by this set in detail, such as events, knowledge, functions, etc. The description should adopt the original sentence order and wording to connect all the entities within the set, and provide a complete narrative of at least 3 sentences without omitting any details; direct quotations of original phrases or appropriate supplements and analyses can be used, but the scattered information should be linked into a coherent, independent, and readable paragraph. It is prohibited to only list the relationships or summarize with a single sentence. - attribute:List any additional information that is not mentioned in the description but may be important, such as the time, place, and background circumstances. If nothing is available, then skip this
