Controlling Amplification Coefficients While chunks link fragmented units to improve response completeness and fluency, oversized chunks risk overload- ing the LLM’s semantic filter and burying critical evidence. Therefore, we set the amplification coefficients to ku = 5 and kc = 2, achieving the optimal trade-off between preci- sion and readability as demonstrated in Figure 4 (a). For DF- Retrieval, the quota kb influences both token costs and the correctness of the diffusion path. As shown in Figure 4 (b), performance peaks at the default setting ofk b = 12. 1 2 3 4 5272829303132333435 0123456789101112131415Avg. Tokens (k) EM Avg. Tokens EMAuto Avg.

The Effectiveness of Adaptive Deep-mining To ascertain whether adaptive deep mining and dynamic context windows constitute effective, explainable mecha- nisms or compromise performance, we conducted controlled experiments on MuSiQue with a fixed retrieval strategy. Figure 6 (a) shows that performance peaks at iteration 3 and then declines. Although the fixed-iteration variant consumes a comparable number of tokens, it consistently lags behind IGMiRAG. The peak coincides with Figure 5, where IGMi- RAG allocates the largest proportion of depth 3 (54.0%) on MuSiQue. This confirms that a fixed iteration budget cannot adapt to the true distribution of reasoning depths. Figure 6 (b) presents that while performance initially im-
