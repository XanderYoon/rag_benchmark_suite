fusion is required, IGMiRAG increases its token usage to 8.6 k+ on Mix and 11.0 k+ on Pathology. Despite this increase, it achieves the highest performance at the second-lowest token cost. Notably, the token con- sumption of all baselines, including NodeRAG, remains approximately constant across varying task complexities, exhibiting only minor and irregular fluctuations. In contrast, IGMiRAG’s consumption scales proportionally with task complexity, enabling cost savings while maintaining strong performance. Furthermore, Figure 3 (b) presents a com- prehensive comparison of all RAG methods on MuSiQue. Obviously, IGMiRAG achieves the highest performance while maintaining both low time and token consumption. 5. Discussions The following sections will analyze the effectiveness of each proposed module and its internal mechanisms, clarifying their individual contributions and synergistic interactions.

Ablation Study To validate the effectiveness of the strategy-driven retrieval mechanism, we conducted ablation studies on MuSiQue while keeping the question parsing strategy fixed. As shown in Table 2, each module and mechanism yields a significant performance improvement for IGMiRAG. Retrieval Ablation.Both BM25 and DF-Retrieval improve initial candidates quality, with the latter yielding larger gains.
