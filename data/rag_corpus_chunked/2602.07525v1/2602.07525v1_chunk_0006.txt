structural connections, IGMiRAG advances further by constructing a hierarchical heterogeneous hypergraph whose layered hy- peredges explicitly encode deductive pathways, achieving improvements at both structural and semantic levels. Query Optimization.Beyond structural enrichment, a complementary line of work optimizes the query side to improve recall. Query rewriting narrows semantic gaps via context augmentation or rephrasing (Gao et al., 2023b), while query decomposition iteratively retrieves sub-answers through progressive queries to construct final answers (Chen et al., 2025b). HyDE (Gao et al., 2023a) generated hypo- thetical documents to enhance dense retrieval. Furthermore, keywords are also extracted to provide term-based matching with methods like BM25 (Robertson & Walker, 1994). Al- though these methods have made improvements over static searchable sources, they still employ fixed strategies that lack task adaptivity. IGMiRAG departs from this paradigm by parsing intuitive strategies from queries to jointly adapt the retrieval process, thereby enabling adaptive deep mining. Retrieval Optimization.Beyond these optimizations, some studies enhance retrieval effectiveness to obtain more rel- evant knowledge. LightRAG (Guo et al., 2024) employs bidirectional expansion to augment adjacent knowledge. PathRAG (Chen et al., 2025a) applies streaming pruning to suppress redundant paths. Cog-RAG (Hu et al., 2025) adopts a cognitive two-stage retrieval to ensure thematic consistency. The PPR (Haveliwala, 2002) algorithm is em- ployed to mine multi-hop nodes (Xu et al., 2025). Despite these refinements, they are still constrained in multi-hop reasoning. Guided by strategies, IGMiRAG drives a depth- adaptive process via deductive pathways to mine in-depth knowledge, significantly advancing multi-hop performance. 3. IGMiRAG 3.1. Overview As illustrated in Figure 2, IGMiRAG consists of four core components: HHHG Index, Retrieval-Strategy Parser (RSP), Intuitive Anchors Retrieval, and Adaptive Deep Min- ing. Specifically, IGMiRAG employs an HHHG to encode knowledge memories and deductive pathways. Prior to re- trieval, the RSP module distills intuitive strategies from queries, providing interpretable guidance
