Stage1 represents the formation of human memory, while Stage2–Stage4 represent intuition-guided reasoning mechanism in human cognition. Upon query encounter, we instantaneously assess and retrieve memory anchors, followed by deeper associative recall. intuition-guided reasoning, we proposeIGMiRAG, a novel framework featuring a more authentic memory architec- ture. As illustrated in Stage1 of Figure 1, the human brain organizes knowledge into a hierarchical associative network. This structure arises from inherent deductive path- ways: high-order memories aggregate multiple low-order atomic facts, while single atoms contribute to various high- level concepts. Thus, knowledge is stored in a hierarchy that integrates multi-order associations. Grounded in this, IG- MiRAG emulates this structure using a Hierarchical Hetero- geneous Hypergraph, where heterogeneous vertices repre- sent multi-granular knowledge and hierarchical hyperedges model deductive pathways. This design establishes a foun- dation for efficient, human-like retrieval. In response to specific tasks (Stage2−Stage4 in Figure 1), humans rapidly activate experiential memories to form intu- ition, determining strategies and locating key memory an- chors. Strategy-guided reasoning then proceeds along hier- archical deductive pathways. This association is inherently bidirectional: top-down (broadcast) activates subordinate low-order
