Bacon. Completed in 1948, it is the first in a series of six heads, the remainder of which were painted the following year in preparation for a November 1949 exhibition at the Hanover Gallery in London. Like the others in the series, it shows a screaming figure alone in a room, and focuses on the open mouth.

The entire upper half has disappeared, leaving only the jaw, mouth and teeth and one ear still intact... -*Entities*- • Head I • Francis Bacon -*Pairwise Relations*- •<Francis Bacon, Head I> Figure 8.An Example of the Indexing Process. 16 IGMiRAG: Intuition-Guided Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Adaptive Mining of In-Depth Memory ♂searchQuering: Answering by retrieving knowledge (including original chunks) Question: Who was the father of The Portrait of George Dyer Talking’s creator? rewrite question:Who is the father of Francis Bacon, the creator of the artwork titled ’The Portrait of George Dyer Talking’? key entities:Francis Bacon|Father, The Portrait of George Dyer Talking|Artwork|Painting keywords:father, Francis Bacon, The Portrait of George Dyer Talking, creator, art target layer:1,matching score:4,semantic depth:2 -*Entities*– • George Dyer • Francis Bacon • Anne (Cooke) Bacon • Diana Watson • Head I • William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley • Albrecht D ¨urer • Albrecht D ¨urer the Elder • D ¨urer’s Father • Portrait of D ¨urer’s Father at 70 • Sir Nicholas Bacon -*Pairwise Relations*- •<Francis Bacon, Portrait of George Dyer Talking> •<George Dyer, Francis Bacon> •<Francis Bacon, 1945 painting> •<Francis Bacon, Anne (Cooke) Bacon> • <Francis Bacon, Sir Nicholas Bacon> •<Francis Bacon, Head I> •<George Dyer, Albrecht D ¨urer> •<Albrecht D ¨urer, Albrecht D¨urer the Elder> -*Multiple Associations*- • <Francis Bacon, Sir Nicholas Bacon, Anne (Cooke) Bacon> •<Figure in a landscape, Francis Bacon, Eric
