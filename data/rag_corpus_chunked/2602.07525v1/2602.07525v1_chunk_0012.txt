PREFERENCE-AWAREBIDIRECTIONAL DIFFUSION Drawing on the human association introduced in Section 1, three governing principles are posited: (i) vertex relevance is positively correlated with adjacency quality; (ii) diffusion should be directionally amplified along deductive paths; and (iii) the required diffusion depth scales positively with question complexity. Under these constraints, aPreference-Aware Bidirectional Diffusion (PABD)algorithm is formulated. It initiates from anchors and conducts a hierarchical, bidirectional diffusion process across the HHHG. The corresponding workflow and pseudocode are provided in Appendix A. Propagation Mode.Each iteration consists of two sequen- tial phases: (i) top-down broadcasting, in which high-order vertices propagate signals along ⟨H → N,L → N ⟩ to strengthen relevant lower-level memories; and (ii) bottom- up screening, wherein low-order vertices feed signals back along ⟨N → H,N → L⟩ only when co-occurrence support exceeds the adaptive threshold τ, thereby reinforcing the corresponding higher-level memories. Preference-aware mechanism.The preference coeffi- cient ρ integrates the count of adjacent propagation sources with their normalized weights. This mechanism amplifies scores along high-preference paths while attenuating those in low-preference directions. Consequently, vertices reach- able via deep multi-hop propagation overcome distance- based decay, achieving competitive relevance scores. Dynamic threshold.The default thresholds are set to τ (L) 0 = 0.5 and τ (H) 0 = 0.4 . A bias b is automatically adjusted based on activation feedback during each iteration. If no new vertices are activated, b increases to trigger back- tracking; otherwise, it decreases. Ultimately, The effective threshold is τ (t) =τ (t) 0 −b , where t∈ {L,H} . This mech- anism balances exploration and exploitation, preventing diffusion stagnation while suppressing noise amplification to ensure controllable propagation. The PABD algorithm terminates upon reaching the query’s semantic depth d or upon
