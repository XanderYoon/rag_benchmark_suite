matching is subsequently applied to the name field of all knowledge units, with the resulting candidatesC BM25 ranked by descending BM25 score. 4 IGMiRAG: Intuition-Guided Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Adaptive Mining of In-Depth Memory Dual-Focus Vector Retrieval (DF-Retrieval).Beyond key- word matching, IGMiRAG employs a dual-focus semantic retrieval mechanism. Guided by the target layerl and match- ing score m provided by the RSP, the system searches the corresponding HNSW subgraph, thereby reinforcing global recall while suppressing cross-type semantic drift. Given a base quota kb, and the allowed bounds kmin, kmax for global retrieval, and the dynamic quota for DF-Retrieval are defined as follows: kG = min l 1− m 6  ·k b +k min m , k max  ,(6) kL = j m 6 ·k b k .(7) The resulting candidates CDF are sorted by descending simi- larity score. Local rankings are appended subsequent to the global rankings, ensuring global candidates retain priority. The union CBM25 ∪ CDF finally constitutes intuitive anchors. 3.4.2. RRF FUSION ANDCHUNKRELEVANCE Both rankings are converted to RRF scores (Cormack et al., 2009) as relevance scores s(v) with smoothing hyper- parameterk 0 = 60: s(v) = X c∈{CBM25,CDF} 1 k0 +rank c(v) , v∈ C BM25 ∪CDF.(8) Scores s(v) are propagated to chunks via unit–chunk asso- ciations. After normalizing each s(v) by its degree (number of associated chunks) to reduce bias from high-frequency vertices, scores are accumulated per chunk to produce the initial chunk-relevance scores(c)as below: s(c) = X (v,c)∈F R s(v) |{c′ |(v, c ′)∈ F R}| , c∈ D.(9) 3.5. Adaptive Deep Mining 3.5.1. PREFERENCE-AWAREBIDIRECTIONAL DIFFUSION Drawing on the human association introduced in Section 1, three governing principles are posited: (i) vertex relevance is positively correlated with adjacency quality; (ii) diffusion should be directionally amplified along deductive paths; and (iii) the required diffusion depth
