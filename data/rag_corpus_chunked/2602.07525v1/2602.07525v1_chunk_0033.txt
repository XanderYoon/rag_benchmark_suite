During retrieval, the system first identifies candidate entities and relations via keyword search. Subsequently, the flow-control pruning mechanism retains only the most relevant paths, with the final result comprising the sequence of entities and relations along these paths. NodeRAG(Xu et al., 2025): A graph-enhanced RAG method that operates on heterogeneous graphs. It employs such a graph structure to uniformly model all knowledge units and generates high-level community summaries through clustering. During retrieval, the system first aggregates global candidates using both keyword search and vector similarity. Subsequently, a shallow Personalised PageRank (PPR) is executed over these candidates to mine potential nodes, yielding the final retrieval context. Hyper-RAG(Feng et al., 2025): A standard hypergraph-enhanced RAG method. It models both pairwise and higher-order relationships as hyperedges, using an index construction process similar to LightRAG. During retrieval, the system first retrieves entity candidates and pairwise/multi-entity relation candidates separately via vector similarity. It then propagates activation through the hyperedges to generate the final set of entities and relations. Cog-RAG(Hu et al., 2025): A hypergraph-enhanced RAG method that employs dual hypergraph modeling for topics and entities. Building on Hyper-RAG, it leverages a topic hypergraph to capture topic associations within text chunks and adopts 15 IGMiRAG: Intuition-Guided Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Adaptive Mining of In-Depth Memory /cogIndexing: Extracting knowledge from the original chunks Title: Portrait of George Dyer Talking Text:Portrait of George Dyer Talking is an oil painting by Francis Bacon executed in 1966. It is a portrait of his lover George Dyer made at the height of Bacon’s creative power. It depicts Dyer sitting on a revolving office stool in a luridly coloured room. His body and face are contorted, and his legs are tightly crossed. His head appears to be framed within a window or door. Above him is a naked hanging lightbulb, a favourite motif
