D.4. Implementation Details and Hyperparameters For all baseline methods, we strictly follow the default hyperparameters and optimal operational modes specified in their official implementations. Detailed configurations are summarized in Table 4. Table 4.The implementation details of each baseline.

Additional Discussions Using the target layer l and matching score m, DF-Retrieval dynamically allocates search quotas between global and target-layer local retrieval. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conducted comparative experiments with fixedl∈[1,3]∩Z andm∈[1,5]∩Zon MuSiQue. Figure 13 (a) illustrates the performance variation across different target layer settings. As
