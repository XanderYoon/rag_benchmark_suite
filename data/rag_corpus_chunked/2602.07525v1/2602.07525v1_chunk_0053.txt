5.target layer:According to the characteristics of the query problem, combined with the information of the knowledge hypergraph architecture, predict which layer of the architecture the answer vertices related to the problem are located in (ranging from 1 to 3, type as Int). 6.matching score:This score (ranging from 1 to 5, type as Int) reflects the degree of relevance between the query answer and the knowledge at the target layer, as well as the complexity of integrating knowledge across different layers during the response. The detailed scoring criteria are as follows: • 5: Very High, the answer must be present in the target layer, and no other layer knowledge is needed; the query can almost be completely resolved within the target layer without cross-layer reference. Usually, it includes simple and isolated facts, superficial information, or macro themes (queries with macro themes almost only focus on the fourth layer). The knowledge at the target layer can provide about 95% to 100% of the content in the answer. • 4: Relatively High, the answer mainly focuses on the target layer, but may still need to call upon a small amount of knowledge from adjacent layers to provide background or supplementary information; most doubts can be resolved within a single domain or layer. The knowledge at the target layer can provide about 80% to 95% of the content in the answer. • 3: Medium, the answer mainly relies on the support of the target layer and its upper-layer knowledge, with limited but necessary cross-layer requirements. The knowledge at the target layer can provide about 60% to 80% of the content in the answer. • 2: Relatively Low, the answer requires the collaboration of multiple layers to support, especially relying on the adjacent upper and lower layers. Any missing key layer will lead to an
