with semantic links, their homogeneous modeling often iso- lates basic and high-order knowledge as structurally dis- parate nodes and edges. This architectural misalignment leads to costly, fragmented retrieval, resulting in poor multi- hop reasoning and generalization (Jimenez Gutierrez et al., 2024). Therefore, recent work (Xu et al., 2025; Guti ´errez et al., 2025) employs heterogeneous graphs to align memo- ries within a unified relevance space to mitigate this limita- tion, but the resulting connections remain limited to binary relations and lack systematic modeling. Consequently, such disordered, low-order connectivity fundamentally limits the depth of memory association and reasoning. How can RAG’s memory retrieval be optimized without significant computational overhead?
