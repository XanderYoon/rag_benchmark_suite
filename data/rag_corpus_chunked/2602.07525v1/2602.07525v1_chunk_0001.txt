Introduction Humans instantly activate long-term memory and think rapidly to generate goal-directed solutions in complex envi- ronments. Our cognitive maturity is rooted in the continuous consolidation of memory and reasoning. While Large Lan- guage Models (LLMs) leverage vast parametric knowledge for broad competence (Naseer et al., 2024; Dagdelen et al., 2024; Ullah et al., 2024), their rigid, static memory often causes hallucinations. This limits their reliability for high- precision and complex decision-making tasks in dynamic environments (Huang et al., 2025b; Jones, 2025). To enhance LLM expertise and reliability, Retrieval- Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a dominant approach by non-parametrically integrating external knowl- edge, enabling low-cost updates (Lewis et al., 2020; Asai et al., 2023). However, its reliance on flat vector similarity limits deep reasoning by failing to capture complex mem- ory connections (Xie et al., 2023; Zhong et al., 2024). To address this, recent research (Edge et al., 2024; Huang et al., 2025a) attempts to build structured knowledge repositories. Graph-enhanced methods (Tian et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2025) map pairwise relationships as edges to form seman- tic paths, while hypergraph-enhanced methods (Feng et al., 2025; Hu et al., 2025) further leverage hyperedges to model high-order concepts like processes and events to establish associative paths among multiple entities. Although these methods have built structured memory banks with semantic links, their homogeneous modeling often iso- lates basic and high-order knowledge as structurally dis- parate nodes and edges. This architectural misalignment leads to costly, fragmented retrieval, resulting in poor multi- hop reasoning and generalization (Jimenez Gutierrez et al., 2024). Therefore, recent work (Xu et al., 2025; Guti ´errez et al., 2025) employs heterogeneous graphs to align memo- ries
