knowledge, significantly advancing multi-hop performance. 3. IGMiRAG 3.1. Overview As illustrated in Figure 2, IGMiRAG consists of four core components: HHHG Index, Retrieval-Strategy Parser (RSP), Intuitive Anchors Retrieval, and Adaptive Deep Min- ing. Specifically, IGMiRAG employs an HHHG to encode knowledge memories and deductive pathways. Prior to re- trieval, the RSP module distills intuitive strategies from queries, providing interpretable guidance for subsequent retrieval processes. Subsequently, the framework first iden- tifies high-quality knowledge as intuitive anchors via BM25 string matching and dual-focus retrieval. During the deep mining phase, IGMiRAG performs preference-aware bidi- rectional diffusion along deductive pathways to uncover latent, relevant knowledge memories. Finally, knowledge and chunks are adaptively selected based on semantic depth, which reflects the question complexity, yielding a compact yet highly relevant context that enables accurate and efficient knowledge-enhanced generation. 3.2. Index construction 3.2.1. HIERARCHICALHETEROGENEOUSHYPERGRAPH By unifying four knowledge memory types and hierarchi- cally modeling their deductive pathways, the HHHG archi- tecture addresses the limitations of homogeneous graphs and hypergraphs in aligning diverse knowledge and cross- dimensional links simultaneously. Within IGMiRAG, an LLM-based analyzer processes raw chunks D, encoding extracted entities N , binary relations L, and multi-entity relationsHas dimensionally consistent heterogeneous ver- tices. Deductive pathways are then encoded via hierarchical hyperedges, including LR (N ↔ L ) and HR (N ↔ H ). Formally as follows: GHHHG = (V,E),(1) V=N ∪ L ∪ H,E=LR ∪ HR.(2) Furthermore, D and F R ({N,L,H} ↔ D ) serve exclu- sively to preserve source-text mapping. The internal struc- tures ofN,L, andHare uniformly formalized as follows: N=  ⟨Na N i ,De N i ,A N i ⟩ |N | i=1, L=  ⟨Na L j ,De L j ,A L j ⟩ |L| j=1,(3) H=  ⟨Na H k ,De H k ,A H k ⟩ |H| k=1, where Na,
