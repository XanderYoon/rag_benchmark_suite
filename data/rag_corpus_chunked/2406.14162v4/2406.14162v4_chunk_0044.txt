C Metrics Computation Details In this project, we use Scikit-Learn (version 1.2.2) to compute AUROC, average precision scores, Brier scores, and F1 scores. We employ rank_eval (version 0.1.3) to compute nDCG and MAP scores, and Scipy.stats to compute Kendall’sτ. For nDCG, relevant scores 0.5 and 1 are assigned to partially relevant and relevant documents correspondingly. When averaging Calibration metrics, we average AUROC with 1− ECE and 1− Brier Score to keep the trend consistent.

D ChatReportRetrieve Data Preprocessing Data Sampling: We sample 31 questions and 80 reports from this application. Importantly, ChatRe- portRetrieve differs from general QA dataset and focuses on integrative queries which usually ask for broad relevant information. Therefore, with con- trolled annotation budget (i.e., number of (query, document) pairs), we are prone to have fewer (but representative) queries and more documents for each query. The queries are strategically sampled to ensure representativeness and diversity. Specifi- cally, 11 queries are the core queries used in Cha- tReport, which cover essential topics of sustainabil- ity disclosure. 20 questions
