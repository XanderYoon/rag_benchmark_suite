alternative prompts with which we experimented. I Creation of the Improved Relevance Definitions Fig. 14 shows the prompt for the creation process of the improved relevance definitions. Following the procedure in Schimanski et al. (2024b), we make use of the text parts labeled as relevant. There exists a relevance score from 1-3 where 1 signals the least and 3 is most relevant. Similar to the base setup for the experiments in Schimanski et al. { Same task description and inputs } Is < paragraph > helpful for answering < question >? Note that the < paragraph > can be helpful even it only addresses part of the < question > without fully answering it . Provide your best guess for this question and the probability that the < paragraph > is helpful . Reply in the following format : [ Reason ]: < Reason why and how the paragraph is helpful or not helpful for answering the question . Clearly indicate your stance . > [ Guess ]: < Your most likely guess , should be one of " Yes " or " No ". > [ Probability Helpful ]: < The probability between 0.0 and 1.0 that the < paragraph > is helpful to the < question >. 0.0 is completely unhelpful and 1.0 is completely helpful . > Figure 10: Output requirements for the alternative prompt setting Pprob. Task description and input are the same as Fig. 9. You will be provided with a < question > the analyst seeks to answer , and a < paragraph > extracted from a lengthy report . Your job is to assess whether the < paragraph > is useful in answering the < question >. < question >: "{ question }" < paragraph >: "{ paragraph_chunk }" { Same output requirements
