shows the prompt template for the creation of the query relevance definition. We ask the model to produce a short definition on which the model should rely. Additionally, we ask the model to produce a list of examples. This structure should align with the manner an expert implicity or ex- plicitly approaches the annotation task of labeling relevance.

Complementing it with examples gives the expert the flexibility to extend the meaning of the terms in exemplified form. For a demonstration of the output, see Table 11.
