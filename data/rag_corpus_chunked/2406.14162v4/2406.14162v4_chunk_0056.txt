This could explain the lower results at lower k’s where differentiating between 2 and 3 is important v.s. the overall nDCG where differentiating between 1 and 2/3 plays a more im- portant role. This intuition is reinforced by the second set- ting, comparing the predictions on all 43K (query, document) pairs. In this setting, we also calculate the relevance for a large amount of non-relevant pairs. As Table 13 shows, the expert-informed definition now seems effective, especially when comparing MAP. MAP is agnostic to the actual degree of relevance and rather just differentiates between relevant and not relevant. Thus, the clearly higher MAP scores show that the expert-informed definition helps in differentiating between the non- relevant pairs where the definition is not meant for vs. those the definition was created with and for. This indicates that our approach is indeed sensitive to adjusting the relevance definitions. K Embedding Fine-Tuning We follow the official fine-tuning example 10 of (Chen et al., 2024) to fine-tune the embedding mod- els. The models are fine-tuned on all annotated (query, document) pairs in ChatReportRetrieve test set for 10 epochs, with a batch size of 4. Other hy- perparameters are the same as the official example. L Hand-Checking DIRAS Model Disagreements with ClimRetrieve We want to check samples where our student model Llama3-Tok’s prediction differs from the relevance label in ClimRetrieve. We sample equally from those samples where Llama3-Tok indicated rele-
