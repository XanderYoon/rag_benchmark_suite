the meaning of the question remains rather static, there are nuanced differences in the examples that guide the relevance labeling. <| system | > You are RankLLM , an intelligent assistant that can rank passages based on their relevancy to the query . <| user | > I will provide you with { num } passages , each indicated by a numerical identifier []. Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query : { query }. { passages } Search Query : { query }. Rank the { num } passages above based on their relevance to the search query . All the passages should be included and listed using identifiers , in descending order of relevance . The output format should be [] > [] , e . g . , [4] > [2]. Only respond with the ranking results , do not say any word or explain . Figure 12: We use exactly the same listwise ranking prompt as Sun et al. (2023b) and Pradeep et al. (2023). Both system and user prompts are presented in this figure. <| system | > You are RankLLM , an intelligent assistant that can rank passages based on their relevancy to the query . <| user | > I will provide you with { num } passages , each indicated by a numerical identifier []. Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query : { query }. { passages } Search Query : { query }. Here are some background information that explains the query : { r e l e v a n c e _ d e f i n i t i o n } Rank the { num } passages above based on their relevance to the search query . All
