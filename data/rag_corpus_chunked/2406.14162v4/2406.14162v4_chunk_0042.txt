"climate risk assessment tools" are relevant. The paragraph states that the Integrated Management System serves to identify risks including environmental risks. In sustain- ability matters, climate change and environmental topics often fall under the same umbrella. Thus, yes, the paragraph is relevant for the question ad- dressing a certified process to manage climate risks. However, also contrary arguments can be consid- ered. We don’t exactly know whether environmen- tal and climate topics are viewed interchangeably. An expert may know clear differentiating factors between environmental and climate matters (e.g., not all environmental problems like water pollu- tion affect the climate). Furthermore, the environ- mental management system is rather a minor note in this paragraph. Additionally, it seems that, al- though it is a general risk management system, the "Quality, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety (QEHS) Management System" is rather used to achieve worldwide objectives for the com- pany. Would you deem this relevant if it was the only information obtained for a company? And what if there are fifteen more documents that are clearly relevant? How would it be labeled then? It is possible to go to lengths and depending on which expert level or context a labeler holds. In a binary relevant/irrelevant setting, both labels would be partially wrong. The reason lies in the fact that when asking whether this document is relevant to the question, the answer is "partially right". B Creation of the Relevance Definition Fig. 7 shows the prompt template for the creation of the query relevance definition. We ask the model to produce a short definition on which the model should rely. Additionally, we ask the model to produce a list of examples. This structure should align with the manner an expert implicity or ex- plicitly approaches the annotation task of labeling relevance. A definition
