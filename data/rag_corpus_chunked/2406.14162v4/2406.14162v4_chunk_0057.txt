While our focus lies on those documents that were not annotated in ClimRetrieve (i.e. irrelevant ones), the dataset also allows us to investigate how our model performs in the edge case of when a ClimRe- trieve annotator deems relevance and Llama3-Tok does not. On the samples that were labeled as irrelevant in ClimRetrieve, we find that our student model Llama3-Tok model is effective in mitigating anno- tation selection bias and therefore incorporates the perspective of IR recall (see Table 5). However, it is interesting that our student model Llama3-Tok successfully overrules human deci- sions. We attribute this to the fact that our created relevance definitions might differ from the mental model of the human annotator in ClimeRetrieve. Thus,
