Post-mortem evidence shows structural brain changes in schizophrenia. The diagnosis may also involve language analysis and assessing consciousness and information processing. Schizophrenia is diagnosed through a comprehensive evaluation that includes medical and psychiatric assessments, as well as a thorough examination of the patient's symptoms, history, and functioning.

Schizophrenia is diagnosed by evaluating a person's symptoms, medical history, and mental state. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) provide guidelines for diagnosing schizophrenia. These guidelines
