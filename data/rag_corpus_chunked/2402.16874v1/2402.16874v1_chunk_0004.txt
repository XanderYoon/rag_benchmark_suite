classification and sentiment analysis tasks, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Devlin et al.'s BERT (2018) introduces bidirectional pre-training, empowering the model to achieve state-of-the-art results across various NLP tasks. These methods lay the foundation for effective text representation, enabling models to capture complex semantic relationships within language. Advancements in query augmentation strategies play a crucial role in improving information retrieval effectiveness. Qiu and Frei (1993) [12] propose a probabilistic query expansion model based on a similarity thesaurus, demonstrating notable improvements in retrieval effectiveness. Voorhees (1994) [13] explores lexical query expansion using WordNet synonym sets, showing the utility of expanding queries based on lexical-semantic relations. Bai 6 et al. (2007) [14] advocate for query-specific contexts, integrating both contexts around and within the query to enhance retrieval effectiveness. These strategies highlight the significance of contextual information in refining the search process and delivering more relevant results. Lastly, prompt optimization techniques contribute to the refinement of large language models. Chung et al. (2022) [3] scale instruction-finetuned language models, showcasing substantial performance gains across various benchmarks. Zheng et al. (2023) [15] introduce Step-Back Prompting, a technique that enables large language models to perform abstractions by deriving high-level concepts from specific instances. This approach significantly improves the models' reasoning abilities, marking a substantial leap in their performance on reasoning-intensive tasks. In conclusion, the intersection of retrieval-augmented generation, information retrieval, text representation, query augmentation, and prompt optimization is a cornerstone in the current landscape of NLP research. Leveraging these advancements provides a robust foundation for augmenting query processes, offering the potential to enhance the precision, diversity, and factual accuracy of natural language understanding systems. 3.
