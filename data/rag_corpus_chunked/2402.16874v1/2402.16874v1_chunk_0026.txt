research suggests that about 80% of the risk is heritable. Studies indicate that multiple genes contribute to the development of the disorder, with no single gene responsible for schizophrenia. Environmental factors, such as prenatal exposure to viruses or substance abuse, may also interact with genetic predispositions to increase the risk. However, the complex interplay between genes and environment is not yet fully understood, and more research is needed to uncover the complete picture of schizophrenia's genetic basis. RAG & No query augmentation Genetics play a significant role in schizophrenia, as there is evidence of a strong genetic component in the development of the disorder. Studies have shown that the risk of developing schizophrenia is higher in individuals with a family history of the condition. The dopamine system, which is involved in the control of movement, may also have an indirect role in the control of positive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as cognition and metarepresentational abilities. However, the exact mechanisms and the role of the frontal lobes in schizophrenia are still not fully understood, and further research is needed to uncover the complete picture of the genetic and neurological factors contributing to the disorder. Genetics play a significant role in schizophrenia, as it is a complex disorder with a strong genetic component. Studies have shown that certain genes are associated with an increased risk of developing schizophrenia. However, the exact role of genetics in schizophrenia is not yet fully understood, as it likely involves a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The context provided discusses the importance of emotional expression and the ability to understand and respond to others' mental states, which is impaired in autistic and schizophrenic individuals. The dopamine system, which is involved in movement control, may also play a role in the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Structural brain
