Leveraging these advancements provides a robust foundation for augmenting query processes, offering the potential to enhance the precision, diversity, and factual accuracy of natural language understanding systems. 3. Our Contribution This article introduces a novel approach to query augmentation in the context of document retrieval, aiming to enhance the efficacy of retrieval-augmented generation systems. The traditional paradigm of relying solely on user queries for document retrieval, or on pairs of query/answer is challenged by the integration of a prompt augmenter, designed to dynamically analyze lexical fields, and generate augmented search queries. By harnessing the power of Language Models (LMs), our methodology provides a nuanced understanding of user intent and significantly enhancing the precision and relevance of retrieved documents. 7 4. Methods 4.1 Methodology Regarding the optimization of document retrieval, our methodology rests on the hypothesis that the insertion of an intermediate document, strategically generated between the user's query and the retriever, could yield enhanced efficiency compared to relying solely on the user's query or a learned pattern of question/answer. Traditional document retrieval systems often hinge on the precision of user queries, expecting these queries to perfectly encapsulate the user's information needs. However, such an approach may encounter challenges when user intent is nuanced or when the available documents possess varying degrees of contextual relevance. To address this, we propose the integration of a generator as a methodological step between the user's query and the retriever, as shown in the Fig 1. This intermediate document, generated dynamically and semantically aligned with the user's query, acts as a contextual bridge. Its purpose is to provide the subsequent retriever with a more nuanced representation of the user's intent, thereby refining the search process. Our methodological approach is founded on the belief that this generated document, shaped by advanced language models, can capture subtle
