are not present. These experiences can be explained by cognitive defects, like a self-monitoring theory, which suggests that individuals with schizophrenia may struggle to distinguish between their own thoughts and reality. This theory can also explain certain types of auditory hallucinations, particularly when a person hears their own thoughts spoken aloud. However, it may not fully explain all forms of hallucinations, as some patients may falsely believe that many people are trying to communicate with them. 20 Can animals have schizophrenia TF-IDF Doc2Vec BERT No RAG & No query augmentation Yes, animals can exhibit behavioral disorders similar to schizophrenia. In animals, these disorders are often referred to as "psychiatric" or "behavioral" disorders. Symptoms may include abnormal social behavior, repetitive or compulsive actions, and changes in normal patterns of behavior.

RAG & No query augmentation Animals, including humans, can experience mental disorders like schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a complex disorder that affects an individual's thoughts, feelings, and behavior. It is characterized by symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking. While animals do not have the same cognitive abilities as humans, they can exhibit some behaviors that may be related to schizophrenia. For example, vervet monkeys with neocortical lesions show changes in their social behavior, which could be similar to the effects of brain damage in schizophrenia. However, it is important to note that the exact causes and mechanisms of schizophrenia in humans and animals are still not fully understood, and more research is needed to determine if there is a direct connection between the two. Yes, animals can have schizophrenia-like symptoms, as some signs of schizophrenia can be studied directly in animals. Stereotyped behavior has been extensively
