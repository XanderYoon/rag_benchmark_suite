motivation. These symptoms can lead to difficulties in communication, relationships, and self-care.

It can lead to difficulties in understanding irony, processing context, and choosing appropriate words. Additionally, schizophrenia may cause hallucinations and delusions, which can interfere with a person's ability to function normally in their daily environment.
