for interpreting results. Researchers are exploring alternative approaches, such as the Comprehensive Assessment of Symptoms and History (CASH), to better understand and diagnose schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is diagnosed by evaluating a person's symptoms, medical history, and mental state. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) provide guidelines for diagnosing schizophrenia. These guidelines include the presence of specific symptoms, such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, disorganized or catatonic behavior, and negative symptoms. A psychiatrist or psychologist will assess the individual's symptoms, duration, and impact on their daily functioning to make a diagnosis. However, the National Institute of Mental Health has expressed dissatisfaction with a diagnostic approach to research on mental disorders and has proposed alternative research domains, such as cognitive systems and systems for social processes. Schizophrenia is diagnosed through a combination of evaluating symptoms, medical history, and a thorough psychiatric assessment. Symptoms typically include delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech and behavior, and negative symptoms such as social withdrawal and lack of motivation. A mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist or psychologist, will assess the individual's symptoms, history, and functioning to determine if the criteria for schizophrenia are met. In some cases, brain imaging or other tests may be conducted to rule out other causes of the symptoms. 23 What role do genetics play in schizophrenia? TF-IDF Doc2Vec BERT No RAG & No query augmentation Genetics play a significant role in schizophrenia, as research suggests that about 80% of the risk is heritable. Studies indicate that multiple genes contribute to the development of the disorder, with no single gene responsible for schizophrenia. Environmental factors, such as prenatal exposure to viruses or substance abuse, may also interact with genetic predispositions to increase the risk. However, the complex interplay between genes and environment is not
