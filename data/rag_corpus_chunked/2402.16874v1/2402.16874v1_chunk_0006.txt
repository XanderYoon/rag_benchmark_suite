1. This intermediate document, generated dynamically and semantically aligned with the user's query, acts as a contextual bridge. Its purpose is to provide the subsequent retriever with a more nuanced representation of the user's intent, thereby refining the search process. Our methodological approach is founded on the belief that this generated document, shaped by advanced language models, can capture subtle nuances and context that may be overlooked in the original user query. The aim is to augment the precision and efficiency of the document retrieval process, ensuring that the subsequent retriever is armed with a more contextually rich input for its search. The potential benefits of this method are diverse. It not only offers a mechanism to handle vague or ambiguous queries but also provides adaptability to users with varied communication styles. Additionally, the generated document serves as a catalyst for refining the retriever's search, offering guidance for a more targeted exploration of the document corpus. In the following sections, we delve into the practical implementation of this method, exploring the 8 role of prompt optimization and document generation in tandem with retrieval-augmented models. This method aims to bridge the gap between user queries and retriever algorithms, testing the efficacy of our hypothesis in optimizing the document retrieval process for greater efficiency and precision. Fig 1. Proposed system architecture 4.2 Prompt Augmenter The Prompt Augmenter operates as a query augmentation tool utilizing a language model generator. The process involves guiding users to distill their original prompts into the underlying questions they seek to answer. Subsequently, the generator, trained to comprehend and generate human-like text, transforms the user’s prompt into an augmented query. This augmented query is carefully crafted to mirror the language commonly found in documents related to the user’s inquiry. By employing a language model generator for query augmentation,
