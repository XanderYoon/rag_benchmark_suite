development of symptoms. The cognitive approach, which focuses on specific symptoms rather than the diagnostic category, can help better understand the role of genetics in schizophrenia. Genetics play a significant role in schizophrenia, as they can provide clues to the identity of the final common pathway in the brain that functions abnormally. While the exact cause of schizophrenia is not fully understood, it is believed that a combination of genetic, environmental, and cognitive factors contributes to the development of the disorder. Studies have shown that schizophrenic patients can differ widely in their symptoms, making it challenging to draw conclusions from early studies based solely on a hospital diagnosis. Recent research has focused on specifying diagnostic criteria and examining the cognitive aspects of schizophrenia, such as reasoning, perseveration, distractibility, and incoherent behavior. Genetics play a significant role in schizophrenia, as research suggests that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of the disorder. Studies have identified multiple genes associated with schizophrenia, and family studies have shown a higher risk of developing the condition among individuals with affected relatives. However, the exact combination of genetic and environmental factors that lead to schizophrenia is still not fully understood. In the context of amphetamine's effects on behavior, it is evident that genetics may influence an individual's susceptibility to experiencing schizophrenic symptoms, such as delusions and auditory hallucinations, when exposed to the drug. 24 How does schizophrenia impact a person's daily life?
