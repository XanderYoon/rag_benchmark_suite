it likely involves a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The context provided discusses the importance of emotional expression and the ability to understand and respond to others' mental states, which is impaired in autistic and schizophrenic individuals. The dopamine system, which is involved in movement control, may also play a role in the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Structural brain changes have been observed in individuals with schizophrenia, and these changes may contribute to the development of the disorder. Leslie's work on mentalizing and metarepresentational abilities has provided insights into the cognitive mechanisms involved in schizophrenia, particularly in relation to pretend play and understanding the mental states of others. In summary, genetics, dopamine system, and brain structure are all factors that play a role in schizophrenia, and further research is needed to fully understand their contributions to the development and progression of the disorder. Genetics play a significant role in schizophrenia, as research suggests that genetic factors contribute to the development of the disorder. Studies have identified multiple genes associated with schizophrenia, although the exact combination of genetic variations and environmental factors that lead to the condition remains complex and not fully understood. RAG & query augmentation Genetics play a significant role in schizophrenia, as there are numerous 'risk' genes associated with the disorder. However, no specific or reliable markers have been found yet. Studies of the brain in schizophrenia have shown increased dopamine-receptor sensitivity, which may contribute to the development of symptoms. The cognitive approach, which focuses on specific symptoms rather than the diagnostic category, can help better understand the role of genetics in schizophrenia. Genetics play a significant role in schizophrenia, as they can provide clues to the identity of the final common pathway in the brain that functions abnormally. While the exact cause of schizophrenia is not
