of brain-behavior relationships and diagnosis. This shift in focus has dominated the study of schizophrenia, particularly in the context of genetics, drug treatment, and brain imaging. Schizophrenia impacts a person's daily life by affecting their ability to understand and communicate with others. This is due to the failure of meta representation, which is the ability to infer the mental states of others. Adult schizophrenic patients, unlike autistic children, continue to make inferences about others' mental states but often get them wrong. This can be observed in their speech and non-verbal communication. Schizophrenic patients may experience reduced action, poverty of speech, and incoherent discourse. At a lower level of severity, they may have inner speech and thought that are experienced as verbal hallucinations. At a higher level of severity, these thoughts are spoken and mixed up with vocal speech. This can lead to confusion for both the patient and the listener. In addition, schizophrenic patients may exhibit stereotyped and perseverative behavior in their speech and other acts.

This can make daily interactions and communication challenging for individuals with schizophrenia. RAG & query augmentation Schizophrenia impacts a person's daily life by causing positive and negative symptoms, affecting cognitive processing and social functioning.

These symptoms can lead to difficulties in communication, relationships, and self-care. Additionally, abnormalities in the experience of action and faulty awareness of others' intentions contribute to the challenges faced by individuals with schizophrenia. Understanding these symptoms and their underlying causes can help develop better treatments and support systems for those affected. Schizophrenia impacts a person's daily life by affecting
