Doc2Vec BERT No RAG & No query augmentation Schizophrenia affects a person's daily life in various ways. It can cause hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking, leading to difficulty in social interactions, work or school performance, and self-care. People with schizophrenia may experience emotional instability, low motivation, and reduced ability to cope with stress. Treatment, including medication and therapy, can help manage symptoms and improve daily functioning. RAG & No query augmentation Schizophrenia impacts a person's daily life by affecting their cognitive abilities, emotions, and social interactions. Symptoms include difficulty recognizing familiar people, reduced emotional responses, and confusion between reality and delusions. The exact cause of these symptoms is not yet fully understood, and researchers are exploring various approaches, such as computational neuropsychiatry, to better understand the disorder. Explaining schizophrenia involves identifying its causes, which can help develop more effective treatments and improve the quality of life for those affected. Schizophrenia impacts a person's daily life by affecting their thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. It can lead to difficulties in understanding mental states, agency, and social interactions. The cognitive approach to understanding the symptoms of schizophrenia has been influenced by various developments, such as computational neuropsychiatry. This field aims to relate cognitive processes to discrete brain systems, which could help explain the disorder's manifestation in the brain. However, the impact of the cognitive approach has been reduced due to the availability of structural and functional brain imaging, which allows for direct observation of brain-behavior relationships and diagnosis. This shift in focus has dominated the study of schizophrenia, particularly in the context of genetics, drug treatment, and brain imaging. Schizophrenia impacts a person's daily life by affecting their ability to understand and communicate with others. This is due to the failure of meta representation, which is the ability to infer the mental states
