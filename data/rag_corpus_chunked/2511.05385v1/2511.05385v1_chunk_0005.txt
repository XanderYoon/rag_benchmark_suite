(a) illustrates Search-R1, a representative agentic RAG method optimized based on the final outcome. (b) shows our proposed method TeaRAG, which achieves a token-efficient agentic RAG by optimizing the retrieved content length with high-density triplets and controlling the number of LLM reasoning steps via a process-aware reward.

The second is the retrieved content that the LLM obtains by invoking a retriever to access external sources. Through statistical analysis of different token types and iteration rounds, as observed in Fig. 2 (a) and Fig. 2 (b), we identify two critical inefficiencies that impact token utilization. First, the retrieved content constitutes the majority of the overall output. This is because chunk-based retrieval methods typically return entire document segments as input to LLMs. However, a substantial portion of these contents may consist of irrelevant or redundant background information that does not enhance the quality of the final answer [ 40]. Therefore, increasing the information density of the retrieved content is essential for improving the token efficiency in agentic RAG. Second, agentic RAG methods generally adopt multi-step reasoning, even when addressing single-hop questions. As shown in Fig. 2
