scale the outcome reward by dividing it by the length of the reasoning path 𝑘, setting 𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 = 𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 𝑘 and 𝑟𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑠 =0 . This approach incentivizes the LLM to solve single-hop questions in a single step. For more complex multi-hop questions, we utilize the process reward to differentiate and evaluate the quality of the reasoning steps. When considering format and outcome rewards, we must also ensure that the process reward is sufficiently high. Furthermore, many reasoning paths in multi-hop questions demonstrate relatively good reasoning processes, but due to variations in the presentation of the output, there are cases where small differences exist between the outcome and ground truth. Therefore, we have relaxed the conditions. Given a question𝑞, the chosen response setWis formally defined as: W=    (𝑞,P 𝑘, 𝑎, 𝑟𝑓 𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑡 , 𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 , 𝑟𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑠 )    𝑟 𝑓 𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑡 =1∧𝑟 𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 =1,if𝑞is single-hop 𝑟 𝑓 𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑡 =1∧  (𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 =1∧𝑟 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑠 ≥0.7)∨ (𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 ≥0.8∧𝑟 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑠 ≥0.8)  ,if𝑞is multi-hop    . (14) Next, for each selected response in W, we choose a corresponding rejected response. Given a chosen response (𝑞,P + 𝑘 , 𝑎+, 𝑟+ format, 𝑟+ outcome, 𝑟+ process), we rank sampled reasoning paths for the question 𝑞 in ascending order based on the sum of the three reward scores. While traversing this ranked list sequentially, we define three types of rejected samples: •Format rejection:𝑟 − format =0. The reasoning path violates the required format. • Easy rejection: 𝑟 − format =1 and 𝑟 − outcome ≤0.3 . The path adheres to the format but fails to reach the correct answer. • Hard rejection: 𝑟 − format =1 , 0.3<𝑟 − outcome ≤𝑟 + outcome −0.3 , and 𝑟 − process ≤𝑟 + process. The path largely progresses toward an answer
