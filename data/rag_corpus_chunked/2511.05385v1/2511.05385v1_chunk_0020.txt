PPR filtering of irrelevant information. The key entities recognized by LLMs at step 𝑖 are denoted as 𝑣𝑖 1, . . . , 𝑣𝑖 𝑗. 4.2.2 Subquery Generation.Based on current key entities and previous reasoning information, the LLM decomposes the original question, generating the current subquery 𝑞𝑖 to be solved. The retrieval algorithmsA R then acquire relevant context centered around this subquery𝑞 𝑖. 4.2.3 Context Retrieval.The context retrieval process of TeaRAG consists of semantic retrieval and graph retrieval. The first component is semantic retrieval. The retriever, R, retrieves relevant chunks D𝑞𝑖 from the document corpus D based on their similarity to the subquery 𝑞𝑖. This is denoted as: D𝑞𝑖 =R (𝑞 𝑖,D) . , V ol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: November 2018. 10 Zhang et al. The second component is graph retrieval, which retrieves a set of knowledge triplets E𝑞𝑖 from the knowledge graph G. However, retrieving triplets based solely on identified key entities without considering detailed relationships risks collecting irrelevant triplets, whereas directly searching for relevant triplets from the entire set can be hampered by excessive noise from similar entries. To address these issues, we propose a two-stage graph retrieval method to perform graph retrieval in a more fine-grained manner. The first stage retrieves relevant entities from the entity set V using the retriever R. For the set of key entities {𝑣𝑖 1, . . . , 𝑣𝑖 𝑗 } from the current reasoning step 𝑖, we generate entity queries by pairing each entity 𝑣𝑖 𝑡 with the subquery 𝑞𝑖 in the format: “Key entity: 𝑣𝑖 𝑡. Query: 𝑞𝑖.” The union of all entities returned by the retriever for these entity queries forms the set V𝑞𝑖 . We then collect all one-hop triplets connected to the entities in V𝑞𝑖 from the knowledge graph, forming the set
