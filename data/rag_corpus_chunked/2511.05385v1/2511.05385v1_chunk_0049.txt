A KAG is constructed and refined using PPR, after which the top-5 ranked chunks and triplets are input to an LLM for answer generation. • TeaRAG-Gemploys iterative question decomposition via an LLM, retrieving relevant knowledge triplets exclusively through graph retrieval until the final answer is produced. • TeaRAG-Semploys iterative question decomposition via an LLM, retrieving relevant chunks solely through semantic retrieval until the final answer is produced. • TeaRAG-Conemploys a hybrid retrieval approach combining semantic and graph retrieval. For each step, it directly concatenates the top-5 chunks and top-5 triplets to form the context. An LLM then iteratively invokes this hybrid retrieval and decomposes the question until the final answer is obtained. It is worth noting that the Single-Con and TeaRAG-Con methods use 10 information units per retrieval, while all other methods use5. We conduct an evaluation of context retrieval methods on two base models, with the results presented in Table 7. From this, we derive the following observations: (1) Agentic iterative retrieval excels by decomposing complex problems.This shows that by breaking down complex problems into simpler ones and solving them step by step, the retrieval system can better focus its information retrieval on a specific problem, thus obtaining more accurate results. (2) Hybrid retrieval achieves superior performance compared to using a single retrieval method. This indicates that hybrid retrieval leverages the strengths of both semantic and graph retrieval. The fusion of content retrieved by the two methods further enhances the LLM’s ability to answer questions, especially for non-iterative methods. (3) TeaRAG constructs a KAG and applies PPR-based filtering to increase the information density of retrieved content while preserving strong
