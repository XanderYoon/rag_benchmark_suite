}, and a knowledge graph G=⟨V,E⟩ where V={𝑣 1, . . . , 𝑣𝑚 } is the entity set and E=  𝑒𝑖 |𝑒 𝑖 =(𝑣 ℎ 𝑖 , 𝑟𝑒𝑙, 𝑣 𝑡 𝑖 ), 𝑣 ℎ 𝑖 , 𝑣𝑡 𝑖 ∈ V is the triplet set, RAG utilizes the retriever R to retrieve relevant information based on question𝑞and inputs it into an LLM for reasoning and answering. Definition 3.1.Single-Round RAG.This paradigm involves a single retrieval step for a given query 𝑞. A retrieval algorithm A R, using a retriever R, gathers information from a document corpus D and a knowledge graph G. The resulting context, C𝑞 =A R (𝑞,D,G) , is the union of retrieved document chunks (D𝑞 ⊆ D ) and knowledge graph triplets (E𝑞 ⊆ G ). This aggregated context is then combined with the instruction 𝐼 and query 𝑞 to form the final prompt for the LLM, which generates the answer𝑎:𝑎=LLM(𝐼, 𝑞,C 𝑞). Definition 3.2.Agentic RAG.This paradigm empowers the LLM to act as an autonomous agent that constructs a dynamic workflow to answer complex questions. The agent iteratively builds a reasoning path, P𝑘, by interleaving thought and retrieved context. Each step 𝑖 of the process unfolds in two parts. First, in the thinking phase, the LLM generates an internal reasoning step 𝑇𝑖 = LLM(𝐼, 𝑞,P 𝑖−1 ) based on the instruction 𝐼, question 𝑞, and its previous steps. Second, in the retrieval phase, a subquery 𝑞𝑖 is extracted from the thought 𝑇𝑖 and used to retrieve relevant context C𝑞𝑖 = A R (𝑞𝑖,D,G) . This cycle continues until a complete reasoning path, P𝑘 =[𝑇 1,C 𝑞1, . . . , 𝑇𝑘,C 𝑞𝑘 ], is constructed. Finally, the LLM generates the final answer based on this complete path: 𝑎= LLM(𝐼, 𝑞,P 𝑘 ).
