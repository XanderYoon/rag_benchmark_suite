to 0.7. This indicates that PPR filtering effectively combines both factors to enhance information density and accuracy. (3) Greater emphasis on co-occurrence structure reduces the average number of content tokens per retrieval.This is because, as co-occurrence structure receives more weight, information , V ol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: November 2018. 26 Zhang et al. from triplet nodes connected to entities and chunks is more activated and ranked higher, thereby reducing the token count. This reveals a trade-off where despite fewer input tokens, missing important background leads to a significant performance drop, e.g., at𝛼=0.9. 46.5 47.0 47.5 (a) Average EM Score 0.1 0.3 0.5 0.7 0.9 44.5 45.0EM Score 56.5 57.0 57.5 (b) Average F1 Score T eaRAG-14B T eaRAG-8B 0.1 0.3 0.5 0.7 0.9 53.5 54.0 54.5F1 Score 0.1 0.3 0.5 0.7 0.9 550 575 600 625 650Content per Retrieval (c) Average T okens of Content per Retrieval Fig. 12.

Performance of TeaRAG-8B with Search-R1-base-7B+R across varying generation tempera- tures. 5.5.3 Effects of Generation T emperature.Because the sampling temperature has a pronounced impact on LLM performance [4], we vary the generation temperature for TeaRAG-8B and Search-R1- base-7B+R to probe robustness. The results are shown in Fig. 13. We have the following observations: (1) Agentic RAG methods are not sensitive to temperature.This is because agentic RAG not only requires the LLM to
