TeaRAG : A Token-Efficient Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework 29 6 Conclusion In this work, we explore a token-efficient agentic RAG framework that aims to improve the token utilization of reasoning paths while performing agentic RAG tasks. We observe that better token efficiency relies on increasing the information density of each retrieved content and reducing the number of reasoning iterations. To this end, we propose TeaRAG. TeaRAG provides a fully automated agentic pipeline, including important entity recognition, subquery generation, context retrieval, summary generation, and final answer generation. To raise the information density per retrieval step, we incorporate high-information-density knowledge triplets and adopt a hybrid retrieval strategy that combines semantic and graph retrieval. We further construct a KAG and
