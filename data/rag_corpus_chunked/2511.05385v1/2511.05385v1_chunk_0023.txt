) and (𝑛𝑑, 𝑛𝑣𝑡 ). Besides, an edge (𝑛𝑑, 𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑙𝑒 ) connects a chunk node 𝑛𝑑 to the entity node of its document title 𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑙𝑒 . Relevance edges quantify the relevance of chunk and triplet nodes to the subquery node. The edge weights are defined as: , V ol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: November 2018. TeaRAG : A Token-Efficient Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework 11 • Chunk-Subquery edge:The weight of the edge (𝑛𝑑, 𝑛𝑞𝑖 ) for a chunk 𝑑∈ D 𝑞𝑖 is based on their similarity: 𝑤(𝑛 𝑑, 𝑛𝑞𝑖 )=sigmoid(sim R (𝑑, 𝑞𝑖 )),(1) where simR is the relevance score computed by the retrieverR, which is then normalized using thesigmoid. • Triplet-Subquery edge:To account for the contextual sparsity of triplets, which can lead to unreliable similarity scores, we apply a thresholding mechanism. The weight of the edge (𝑛𝑒, 𝑛𝑞𝑖 )for a triplet𝑒∈ E 𝑞𝑖 is: 𝑤(𝑛 𝑒, 𝑛𝑞𝑖 )=max(sigmoid(sim R (𝑒, 𝑞𝑖 )) −𝜏,0),(2) where𝜏is a threshold hyperparameter. 4.2.5 Personalized PageRank Filtering.After constructing the KAG, we employ PPR to identify the most important content nodes. This process allows us to dynamically select key information and compress tokens by replacing text chunks with high-density triplets, while ensuring relevance. We denote the importance distribution across all nodes as 𝜋. The weighted adjacency matrix from the graph construction is normalized to produce the transition matrix 𝑊 . Besides, we denote the personalization vector as 𝑝, which acts as a bias to steer the final importance distribution. To ensure the relevance of the context to the subquery, the values for the subquery node 𝑛𝑞𝑖 in the personalized vector 𝑝 are set to 1. Meanwhile, the key entities identified by the LLM have their corresponding values in 𝑝 set to 0.5, serving as anchors for the question. Subsequently, we iterate for 𝑁 rounds
