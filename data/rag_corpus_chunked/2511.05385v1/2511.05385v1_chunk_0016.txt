extracted from the thought 𝑇𝑖 and used to retrieve relevant context C𝑞𝑖 = A R (𝑞𝑖,D,G) . This cycle continues until a complete reasoning path, P𝑘 =[𝑇 1,C 𝑞1, . . . , 𝑇𝑘,C 𝑞𝑘 ], is constructed. Finally, the LLM generates the final answer based on this complete path: 𝑎= LLM(𝐼, 𝑞,P 𝑘 ). This work aims to develop a token-efficient agentic RAG system that preserves correctness while compressing P𝑘, thereby enhancing token efficiency. As analyzed in Section 1, TeaRAG achieves this goal via two key perspectives. (1) constructing higher-density contexts C𝑞𝑖 by shortening the context per retrieval while retaining essential content. (2) reducing the number of reasoning steps𝑘 thereby enhances the efficiency of reasoning. 4 Methodology In this section, we present the overall implementation of TeaRAG. First, we describe the knowledge graph construction in Section 4.1. Second, based on the existing corpus, we outline the TeaRAG pipeline in Section 4.2. Finally, we introduce the training strategies employed to realize this pipeline in Section 4.3, including SFT and IP-DPO. 4.1 Knowledge Graph Construction Most graph-enhanced RAG [39, 77] methods construct knowledge graphs from relatively small corpora (sub-million scale).
