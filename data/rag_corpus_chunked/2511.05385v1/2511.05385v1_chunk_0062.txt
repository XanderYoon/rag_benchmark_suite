reasoning iterations. To this end, we propose TeaRAG. TeaRAG provides a fully automated agentic pipeline, including important entity recognition, subquery generation, context retrieval, summary generation, and final answer generation. To raise the information density per retrieval step, we incorporate high-information-density knowledge triplets and adopt a hybrid retrieval strategy that combines semantic and graph retrieval. We further construct a KAG and apply co-occurrence-based PPR to preserve rich context and boost information density. To reduce the number of reasoning iterations, we introduce IP-DPO, which uses process-aware rewards to supervise the reasoning path, preventing overthinking and redundant retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and its superior token efficiency. References [1] Nicholas Alonso and Beren Millidge. 2024.
