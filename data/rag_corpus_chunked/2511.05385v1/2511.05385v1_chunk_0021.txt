we generate entity queries by pairing each entity 𝑣𝑖 𝑡 with the subquery 𝑞𝑖 in the format: “Key entity: 𝑣𝑖 𝑡. Query: 𝑞𝑖.” The union of all entities returned by the retriever for these entity queries forms the set V𝑞𝑖 . We then collect all one-hop triplets connected to the entities in V𝑞𝑖 from the knowledge graph, forming the set E𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑡 𝑦. In the second stage, we retrieve the set of triplets most relevant to𝑞𝑖 from this constrained triplet set, defined asE 𝑞𝑖 =R (𝑞 𝑖,E 𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑡 𝑦 ). In the above two components, we employ a top-K strategy to directly select the top-K contexts with the highest retrieval scores. We denote the size of these sets as |D𝑞𝑖 |=𝑘 𝑑 and |E𝑞𝑖 |=𝑘 𝑡. Next, our aim is to select the final 𝑘𝑓 contexts for the LLM from the set D𝑞𝑖 ∪ E𝑞𝑖 by constructing a KAG based on the co-occurrence mechanism. 4.2.4 Knowledge Association Graph Construction.Based on the retrieved content, we construct a KAG, a heterogeneous graph designed to capture the co-occurrence relationships between different knowledge elements. This graph comprises four distinct node types and two types of association edges that connect them, as shown in Fig. 4 (b). The node types are defined as follows: • Subquery node 𝑛𝑞𝑖 :A single node representing the current subquery 𝑞𝑖. This node serves as the central anchor of the graph, and all other information is retrieved based on this. • Chunk node 𝑛𝑑:Each node of this type represents a textual chunk 𝑑 from the retrieved document setD 𝑞𝑖 . • Triplet node 𝑛𝑒:Each node of this type represents a knowledge triplet 𝑒 from the triplet set E𝑞𝑖 . • Entity node 𝑛𝑣:Each node of this type represents an entity 𝑣, which can be one of the entities 𝑣𝑖 1, .
