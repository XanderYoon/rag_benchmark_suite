Iterative RAG utilizes LLMs to autonomously determine whether retrieval is needed, making multiple calls to retrieval tools and integrating multiple retrieval contexts to derive the final answer. The methods in this category are as follows: • IRCoT[ 59]:This method iteratively utilizes Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to guide retrieval and uses retrieval results to enhance CoT to derive the final answer. • SelfRAG[ 2]:This method utilizes LLMs to
