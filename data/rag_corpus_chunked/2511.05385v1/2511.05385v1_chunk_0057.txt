Effects of Generation T emperature.Because the sampling temperature has a pronounced impact on LLM performance [4], we vary the generation temperature for TeaRAG-8B and Search-R1- base-7B+R to probe robustness. The results are shown in Fig. 13. We have the following observations: (1) Agentic RAG methods are not sensitive to temperature.This is because agentic RAG not only requires the LLM to generate content, but also to ground its generation in retrieved external information, which reduces uncertainty. (2) TeaRAG-8B consistently outperforms Search-R1-base-7B+R across different temperatures, further demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of TeaRAG.We performed a two- sided paired t-test on the overall QA results, and𝑝<0.05 indicates that our method is significantly better than Search-R1-base-7B+R. (3) As temperature increases, the performance of TeaRAG-8B exhibits a slight decline.A likely reason is that higher temperature induces more diverse reasoning paths, which increases variance , V ol. 1, No. 1, Article .

For the training overhead, the statistics are summarized in the Table 9. First, TeaRAG requires less total training time compared to Search-R1, primarily because the IP-DPO framework decouples the training and sampling stages, thereby enhancing overall training
