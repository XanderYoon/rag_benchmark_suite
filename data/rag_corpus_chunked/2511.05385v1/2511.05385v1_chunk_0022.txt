Chunk node 𝑛𝑑:Each node of this type represents a textual chunk 𝑑 from the retrieved document setD 𝑞𝑖 . • Triplet node 𝑛𝑒:Each node of this type represents a knowledge triplet 𝑒 from the triplet set E𝑞𝑖 . • Entity node 𝑛𝑣:Each node of this type represents an entity 𝑣, which can be one of the entities 𝑣𝑖 1, . . . , 𝑣𝑖 𝑗 identified at reasoning step 𝑖, a source document title for a chunk, or a head or tail entity from a knowledge triplet. The edges of the KAG capture either structural co-occurrence or semantic similarity, and are categorized asco-occurrence edgesandrelevance edges, respectively. Besides, all edges are undirected. Co-occurrence edges signify structural or contextual links between nodes. They are assigned a weight of1and are defined by the following rules: • Entity-Entity edge:An edge (𝑛𝑣ℎ, 𝑛𝑣𝑡 ) connects the head and tail entities of a triplet 𝑒= (𝑣 ℎ, 𝑟𝑒𝑙, 𝑣 𝑡 ). • Triplet-Entity edge:Edges (𝑛𝑒, 𝑛𝑣ℎ ) and (𝑛𝑒, 𝑛𝑣𝑡 ) connect a triplet node to its constituent entities. • Chunk-Triplet edge:If a triplet 𝑒∈ E 𝑞𝑖 and its source chunk 𝑑 is also in D𝑞𝑖 , an edge (𝑛𝑒, 𝑛𝑑 ) is created, signifying a co-occurrence between the triplet and the chunk. • Chunk-Entity edge:When a triplet 𝑒=(𝑣 ℎ, 𝑟𝑒𝑙, 𝑣 𝑡 ) co-occurs with a chunk 𝑑, edges are also added between the entity nodes of the triplet and the chunk node (𝑛𝑑, 𝑛𝑣ℎ ) and (𝑛𝑑, 𝑛𝑣𝑡 ). Besides, an edge (𝑛𝑑, 𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑙𝑒 ) connects a chunk node 𝑛𝑑 to the entity node of its document title 𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑙𝑒 . Relevance edges quantify the relevance of chunk and triplet nodes to the subquery node.
