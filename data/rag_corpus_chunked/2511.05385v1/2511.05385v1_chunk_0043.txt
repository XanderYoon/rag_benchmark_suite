(5) More advanced retrieval systems are capable of yielding better results.For a fair comparison with TeaRAG, we enhanced the original Search-R1 and R1-Searcher with a reranking-integrated retrieval system, which led to a significant performance increase. The continued superiority of TeaRAG over these augmented baselines highlights the effectiveness of its context retrieval strategy. 5.3 Analysis of Reasoning Paths 5.3.1 Distribution of the Number of Reasoning Steps.We present the reasoning step distribu- tion of TeaRAG and other similarly-scaled agentic RAG baselines in Fig. 6. Since most methods require at least one reasoning step, we show the distribution of reasoning steps from1 to 5. We obtain the following observations: (1) TeaRAG requires shorter reasoning steps compared to agentic RAG baseline methods. This indicates that by incorporating process supervision signals, we effectively guide the LLM’s reasoning process, reducing indirection and improving overall efficiency. , V ol. 1, No. 1, Article .
