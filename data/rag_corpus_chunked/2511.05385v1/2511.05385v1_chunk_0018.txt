co- occurrence. Semantic retrieval offers rich background and conceptual context but suffers from low information density, noise [2, 40, 73], and inefficient token use. Conversely, graph retrieval yields high-density triplets containing precise facts but lacking contextual grounding. Besides, when a chunk from semantic retrieval and a triplet from graph retrieval correspond to the same source data, their co-occurrence constitutes a robust relevance signal, functioning as a high-confidence filter. Therefore, TeaRAG exploits this intrinsic relationship between chunks and triplets to reconcile the accuracy–efficiency trade-off. By prioritizing co-occurring chunk–triplet pairs over less certain chunks, TeaRAG can enhance contextual accuracy while improving token efficiency for the LLM. , V ol. 1, No. 1, Article .
