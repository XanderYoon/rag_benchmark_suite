TeaRAG : A Token-Efficient Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework 5 • We conduct comprehensive experiments and detailed analyses across six benchmark datasets, validating the effectiveness and token efficiency of our pipeline and training methods. 2 Related Work 2.1 Retrieval-Augmented Generation LLMs are trained on massive datasets, possessing powerful capabilities in understanding [ 12], generation [74], and reasoning [36, 52]. However, when faced with knowledge-intensive tasks [35], LLMs that rely solely on their parametric memory are prone to hallucination [ 12, 27, 34]. RAG addresses this by using a retriever to search a corpus for information snippets relevant to a query. These information are then provided to the LLM as evidence to generate more reliable answers. The field of RAG has attracted significant attention in recent years, spurring substantial research. We will focus on introducing agentic RAG and graph-enhanced RAG, which are most relevant to our work. 2.1.1 Agentic RAG.A comprehensive RAG system typically involves multiple sub-steps, includ- ing query planning [ 61], query rewriting [37, 42], retrieval [40], reranking [65], refinement [23], and generation. Traditional RAG systems usually follow pre-defined sub-steps designed by humans. However, this approach fails to dynamically adapt to task requirements and performs poorly when facing complex multi-hop tasks [ 15]. To autonomously control the RAG process, agentic RAG applies the agent approach [63, 76]. Through the planning and comprehension capabilities of LLMs, it iteratively breaks down complex problems into executable operations and queries until an answer is found. Initial works use prompt-based approaches for preset process control [36, 59, 81], determining whether RAG should continue querying or provide an answer to the question. However, due to the lack of training specifically for RAG scenarios, these methods
