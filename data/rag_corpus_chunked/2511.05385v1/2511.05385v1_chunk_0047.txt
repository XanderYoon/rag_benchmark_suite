We primarily focus on two core retrieval paradigms: iterative and hybrid search. To further understand the role of these paradigms, we design the following context retrieval variants: • Single-Gperforms single-round graph retrieval to obtain knowledge triplets pertinent to the query, which are subsequently provided to an LLM for answer generation. • Single-Sconducts single-round semantic retrieval to obtain chunks, then feeds them to an LLM for output. • Single-Conadopts a single-round hybrid retrieval strategy combining semantic and graph retrieval. The top-5 chunks and top-5 triplets are concatenated and passed to an LLM for answer generation. , V ol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: November 2018. 22 Zhang et al. Table 8.
