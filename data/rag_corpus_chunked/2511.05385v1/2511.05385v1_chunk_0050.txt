using a single retrieval method. This indicates that hybrid retrieval leverages the strengths of both semantic and graph retrieval. The fusion of content retrieved by the two methods further enhances the LLM’s ability to answer questions, especially for non-iterative methods. (3) TeaRAG constructs a KAG and applies PPR-based filtering to increase the information density of retrieved content while preserving strong performance.This is because PPR’s co- occurrence-based mechanism removes irrelevant or verbose chunks and thereby further enhances accuracy. In contrast, although TeaRAG-Con utilizes hybrid retrieval, its direct concatenation of chunks and triplets increases input length and introduces extraneous noise. (4) Semantic retrieval outperforms graph retrieval by preserving information integrity.This is primarily because important information within the chunks can be lost during graph construction. Additionally, the triplets’ lack of sufficient context can lead to ambiguity and increase the difficulty for the LLM to comprehend. 5.4.2 Effect of Process Rewards.To conduct an in-depth analysis of the advantages offered by process rewards, we perform an ablation study specifically on process rewards.
