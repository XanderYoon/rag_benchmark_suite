system from leveraging both retrieval methods’ strengths [16] and hinders retrieval systems in preserving critical information and removing irrelevant noise. Finally, most agentic RAG systems train LLMs with outcome-based rewards via RL [27, 54]. This reward design is typically sparse and noisy, which can hinder stable and efficient training [66]. Besides, agentic RAG methods [53, 66] are usually trained using RL algorithms such as PPO [51] and GRPO [52]. These approaches require multi-machine coordination and continuous external retrieval access during training [56], which makes the training process prohibitively slow. To address this limitation, recent approaches employ GPT -4o for process -based reward annotation [ 83], and then optimize using DPO [49]. However, the reward annotation process is costly and depends on proprietary models. To gain deeper insights into the token usage of existing agentic RAG systems, we analyze two representative methods: Search-R1 [27] and R1-Searcher [54]. As illustrated in Fig. 1 (a), the output of an agentic RAG system primarily consists of two types of tokens generated through multiple iterations. The first is the LLM’s thinking process, where these tokens are used for planning, problem , V ol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: November 2018.
