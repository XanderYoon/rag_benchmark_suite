to achieve more accurate results [6, 10, 15, 16, 70]. These graph-enhanced RAG approaches can be categorized into three strategies. First, some methods employ classical graph algorithms such as Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree [17] and PPR [ 1, 15, 16] to retrieve all query-related information in one step, then feed the entire retrieved context to the LLM for direct answer generation [70, 84]. Second, some approaches employ LLM prompts to select the optimal triplet path from all candidate reasoning paths based on topological relationships in the graph structure [6, 10, 57]. Last, recent concurrent work has explored extending RL-based training approaches from agentic RAG to graph-enhanced RAG, aiming to fully leverage the reasoning capabilities of LLMs [39, 77]. Nevertheless, a key challenge in knowledge graph construction is the potential for information loss [69], as the process simplifies complete text into structured triplets. To address this issue, some works dynamically construct knowledge graphs after receiving specific queries [24, 73], which enables the targeted capture of core information rele- vant to the query from the text. Nevertheless, these approaches incur additional online inference time and high computational costs. Alternatively, some methods adopt a hybrid approach that combines chunk-based semantic retrieval with graph-based retrieval mechanisms to leverage the advantages of both strategies [16, 38, 41, 50, 77]. Current graph-enhanced RAG still has its limitations. First, these methods typically utilize existing small-scale knowledge graphs [17, 70] or construct them from relatively small (sub-million scale) corpora [15, 16, 39], lacking validation on sufficiently large-scale graph data. Furthermore, graph- enhanced RAG systems typically select a fixed number of top-ranked triplets [ 6, 10, 70] or their associated text chunks [15, 16], or directly concatenate the retrieved triplets and chunks as input [50, 77]. However, these approaches fail to fully exploit the co-occurrence of different representations of the
