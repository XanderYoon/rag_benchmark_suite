create en- sembles using detection and retrieval results as well as ex- periment with other widely-used techniques, such as feature manipulation and re-ranking. We report the effectiveness of these post-processing methods on Section 3.4.

Weighted Boxes Fusion In order to enhance the retrieval performance even further, we adopt the WBF [18] technique of creating well-cropped query and database images from the results of multiple detectors. WBF collates all box in- formation from our detection network and provides more accurate predictions which we found to correct inconsisten- cies in results. Feature Concatenation As each model captures different features of a given image, we ultimately concatenate l2- normalized feature embeddings to increase our accuracy when retrieving images. This method has a trade-off with computation time and memory being used; however, each addition of features helped to achieve better performance in the task of image retrieval. 3. Experiments In this section, we describe the datasets that were used and report experimental result details. Included
