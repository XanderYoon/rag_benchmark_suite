gave a negligible increase. We speculate that this is because there were too many similar boxes proposed for the high recall query, hence the weighted sum of those boxes were not an informative image representation. Re-ranking In Table 7, we present the experiment of k- reciprocal encoding [25], a well-known re-ranking tech- nique in the Re-ID task, based on the DeepFashion2 vali- dation set. This method requires much less bounding boxes to be present thus we used WBF to reduce the bounding boxes from 590k (W BF5) to 126k (W BF5). Interestingly, the k-reciprocal encoding helped increase the acc@10 by 0.02 but overall, the performance was still less than simply having reduced the boxes to 440k (W BF5) using the WBF. 4. Conclusion In this paper, we presented an effective pipeline for a real-world clothes retrieval system, including detection and retrieval task. And also, we investigated various post- processing methods such as weighted boxes fusion, feature concatenation, and other techniques. Table 8 shows the ﬁ- nal result of the DeepFashion2 clothes retrieval challenge in 2020 and 2019. With the proposed pipeline, we achieved 0.854168 on Acc@10 in the test phase and ranked on 2nd place in the DeepFashion2 clothes retrieval challenge 2020. Furthermore, we believe the considered pipeline and meth- ods described in this paper can be generalized to fulﬁll vi- sual search for images not only about fashion but also fur- niture, beauty products and toys.
