Abstract In this paper, we propose an effective pipeline for clothes retrieval system which has sturdiness on large-scale real- world fashion data. Our proposed method consists of three components: detection, retrieval, and post-processing. We ﬁrstly conduct a detection task for precise retrieval on tar- get clothes, then retrieve the corresponding items with the metric learning-based model. To improve the retrieval ro- bustness against noise and misleading bounding boxes, we apply post-processing methods such as weighted boxes fu- sion and feature concatenation. With the proposed method- ology, we achieved 2nd place in the DeepFashion2 Clothes Retrieval 2020 challenge. *All authors from Visual Search & Recommendation team at NA VER/LINE corporation contributed equally to this work and are listed in alphabetical order by last name. 1. Introduction Recently, fashion domain has attracted much attention in computer vision research. Similarly, demand for online shopping for ‘fashionable’ items has also emerged to be one of the world’s largest industries. Thus, it has become crucial for
