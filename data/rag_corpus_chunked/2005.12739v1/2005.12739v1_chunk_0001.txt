Introduction Recently, fashion domain has attracted much attention in computer vision research. Similarly, demand for online shopping for ‘fashionable’ items has also emerged to be one of the world’s largest industries. Thus, it has become crucial for advanced visual clothing retrieval systems to provide the ﬁnest shopping experience for online customers. In this paper, we present an effective pipeline for a real-world clothes retrieval system using large-scale fashion data. The clothes retrieval system includes two vision tasks: detection and retrieval. Since the advent of deep convolu- tional neural networks (DCNN), vision tasks have improved to show astonishing results thus we employ modern vari- ants of these DCNN models in our detection and retrieval network. In addition, we take advantage of popular post- processing methods to further improve the performance of the retrieval system: weighted boxes fusion (WBF) methods to effectively combine the predicted boxes of multiple de- tectors, and feature concatenation to elevate the similarities 1 arXiv:2005.12739v1 [cs.CV] 26 May 2020 Dataset # of pairs # of images DeepFashion2 [4] 873,234 491,895 DARN [9] 91,390 182,780 Street2Shop [13] 39,479 416,840 Zalando [5] 16,253 32,642 MVC [12] 36,656 156,449 MPV [3] 13,524 50,290 Table 1: The utilized fashion-related datasets.
