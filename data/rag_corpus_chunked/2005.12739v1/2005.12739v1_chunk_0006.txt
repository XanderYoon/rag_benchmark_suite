Thus, we decided to use the full dimensions of the concatenated features to maximize the score. QE and DBA Query expansion (QE) [2] and database-side augmentation (DBA) [20] replaces each feature point with a weighted sum of its top k nearest neighbors and the point itself. The purpose of these techniques is to obtain rich and distinctive image representations by exploiting the nearest neighbors. However, QE decreased in overall performance while DBA gave a negligible increase. We speculate that this is because there were too many similar boxes proposed for the high recall query, hence the weighted sum of those boxes were not an informative image representation. Re-ranking In Table 7, we present the experiment of k- reciprocal encoding [25], a well-known re-ranking tech- nique in the Re-ID task, based on the
