Weighted boxes fusion (WBF) results on Deep- Fashion2 validation set . W BFn refers WBF result with n models. There are performance gains as more detection models are added. 3.3. Retrieval Results Table 3 shows the performances of retrieval models us- ing ground-truth bounding boxes on the DeepFashion2 vali- dation set. In addition to the DeepFashion2train set, we ac- cumulated publicly available datasets as listed in Table 1 to train our retrieval models. The default conﬁgurations used to train retrieval models is described in the Table 4. 3.4. Post-processing Results We summarize the aforementioned post-processing methods with a description of how it was applied and whether it worked to improve image retrieval result. 3.4.1 What worked well WBF Using ATSS bounding boxes showed the best score on the Acc@10 so it is chosen to be the base when fus- ing other results from detection models. As shown in Table 5, the detection performance increments as more boxes are merged together. Feature Concatenation We summarize performances of ensembled retrieval models using W BF5 bounding boxes on the DeepFashion2 validation/test set in Table 6. By in- volving more models, we gain 0.019/0.014 increases on the Acc@10 results as compared to that of the single baseline retrieval model on DeepFashion2 validation/test set. 3.4.2 What did not work well PCA Whitening In our experiments, dimensionality reduc- tion by principal component analysis (PCA) [23] always de- creased performance by a small margin. Using the ﬁndings of our prior experiment, we applied whitening [17] without Ensemble Model Validation (Acc@10) Test (Acc@10) m4 (baseline) 0.869435 0.840060 m0-13 (w/o m6-9) 0.875656 0.849722 m0-13 (w/o m6-7) 0.876141 0.853057 m0-16 (w/o m7) 0.876868 0.851860 m1-16 (w/o m7) 0.877192 0.851945 m0-17 (w/o m7) 0.876222 0.851945 m1-16 0.888341 0.854168 m1-17 0.888180 0.853356 Table 6: Top-10 accuracy of retrieval ensembled mod- els with
