Methodology In this section we present our method of clothes retrieval which consists of three components: detection, retrieval, and post-processing. Figure 1 depicts the whole pipeline. 2.1. Detection To retrieve fashion items correctly on an image, it is necessary to detect each fashion item via a detection net- work. We leverage ﬁve state-of-the-art object detection models to get well-localized and classiﬁed clothing boxes: adaptive training sample selection (ATSS) [24], cascaded mask R-CNN [1], CenterNet [26], RetinaNet-R101-FPN, and RetinaNet-X101-FPN [11]. We report detection per- formances in detail on Section 3.2. 2.2. Retrieval To perform retrieval tasks based on the detected cloth- ing items, we evaluate prevalent DCNN models (e.g. ResNet152 [6] and SE-ResNeXt101 [8]), optimize loss functions and ﬁne-tune hyperparameters to decide on the well performing options. In addition, we leveraged a unique framework called combination of multiple global descrip- tors (CGD) [10] which has been proven to increase perfor- mance of a model by combining multiple global descriptors, such as maximum activation of convolutions (MAC) [19] and generalized mean pooling (GeM) [15]. We report the performances of the utilized models in Section 3.3. 2.3. Post-processing To boost the performance of the clothes retrieval task, we exploit several post-processing methods. We create en- sembles using detection and retrieval results as well as ex- periment with other widely-used techniques, such as feature manipulation and re-ranking. We report the effectiveness of these post-processing methods on Section 3.4.
