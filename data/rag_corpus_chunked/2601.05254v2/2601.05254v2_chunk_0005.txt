Figure 2: The proposed TagRAG framework. structed knowledge graph while supporting incre- mental knowledge integration. 3 Task Definition TagRAG is dedicated to building a hierarchically explicit knowledge graph under any domain to enable powerful and efficient RAG capabilities. Given a set of documents D={d i}|D| i=1, key do- main information are extracted to construct an ob- ject tag knowledge graph Go = (V o,E o). In order to form a clear structured knowledge management, given a root domain ˆv, a hierarchical domain tag system Gd = (V d,E d) needs to be established. It contains domain tags Vd at different levels and hierarchical relationships Ed between tags. For knowledge coordination and fusion, the object tags should be linked to the domain tag system and a hierarchical tag knowledge graph is constructed: G= (V o,E o,V d,E d,E od), where Eod represents the relationships between the object and domain tags. For retrieval-augmented generation, given a question q, the hierarchical tag knowledge graph is searched to generate a global and comprehensive answera: a← F(q,G), whereF(·)means the graph-based RAG method. 4 TagRAG As shown in Figure 2, TagRAG consists of two stage: (1) Tag Knowledge Graph Construction and (2) Tag-guided Retrieval-Augmented Generation. We extract the keywords from documents as object tags as well as their relationships. Linking them to the pre-defined root domain tag, domain tag chains are
