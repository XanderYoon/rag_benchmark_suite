chain and w/o fusion. TagRAG w/o chain simply adds the retrieved fused domain-centric knowledge to the context without involving the information in the associated domain chain. And TagRAG w/o fu- sion not only discards the knowledge of the domain chain, but also cuts off the object tag information connected to the retrieved domain tag. It relies entirely on the description of the domain tags to answer the question. It can be clearly found that (1) the absence of these two components makes the answers generated by the model far inferior to the full TagRAG and (2) retaining fused domain- centric knowledge is better than simply using the description of domain tags for generation. 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Round 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Winning Rate (%) v.s.
