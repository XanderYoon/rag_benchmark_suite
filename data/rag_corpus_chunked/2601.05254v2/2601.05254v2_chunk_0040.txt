MiniRAG with Qwen3-4B 18 Prompt of question generation Given the following description of a dataset: {total_description}. Please identify 5 potential users who would engage with this dataset. For each user, list 5 tasks they would perform with this dataset. Then, for each (user, task) combination, generate 5 questions that require a high-level understanding of the entire dataset. Output the results in the following structure: - User 1: [user description] - Task 1: [task description] - Question 1: ... - Question 5: ... - Task 5: [task description] ... - User 5: [user description] ... Prompt of evaluation —Role— You are an expert tasked with evaluating two answers to the same question based on three criteria: **Comprehensive- ness**, **Diversity**, **Empowerment**, and **Directness**. You will evaluate two answers to the same question based on three criteria: **Comprehensiveness**, **Diversity**, and **Empowerment**. - **Comprehensiveness**: How much detail does the answer provide to cover all aspects and details of the question? - **Diversity**: How varied and rich is the answer in providing different perspectives and insights on the question? - **Empowerment**: How well does the answer help the reader understand and make informed judgments about the topic? For each criterion, choose the better answer (either Answer 1 or Answer 2) and explain why. Then, select an overall winner based on these three categories. Here is the question: {query} Here are the two answers: **Answer 1:** {answer1} **Answer 2:** {answer2} Evaluate both answers using the three criteria listed above and provide detailed explanations for each criterion. Output your evaluation in the following JSON format: {“Comprehensiveness”: {“Winner”: “[Answer 1 or Answer 2]”, “Explanation”: “[Provide explanation here]”}, “Diversity”: {“Winner”: “[Answer 1 or Answer 2]”, “Explanation”: “[Provide explanation here]”}, “Empowerment”: {“Winner”: “[Answer 1 or Answer 2]”,
