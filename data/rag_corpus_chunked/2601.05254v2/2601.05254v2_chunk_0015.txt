Even facing the 70B model, TagRAG can compete with it. This demonstrates that TagRAG does not rely solely on the inherent capabilities of the language model, and that the tag chain mechanism effectively broadens the boundaries of global reasoning. 6.2 Performance-efficiency Analysis In Figure 3, we show the performance, graph con- struction time and inference time of different meth- ods. TagRAG, which presents the largest bubbles, embodies the strongest performance, and possesses low graph construction time and inference time. GraphRAG not only exhibits weak performance, but also consumes extremely high construction and inference costs. MiniRAG has the next strongest performance, but its graph construction time is far behind TagRAG, due to its ultimate entity and re- lationship extraction. Despite the excellent time overhead with lightweight extraction, the perfor- mance of LightRAG is the worst, subject to the gap of high and low level semantics. Taken together, thanks to the advanced domain chain indexing and knowledge integration, TagRAG has achieved the strongest performance-efficiency results. 6.3 Ablation Study We conduct ablation experiments on the four datasets by comparing TagRAG with TagRAG w/o chain and w/o fusion. TagRAG w/o chain simply adds the retrieved fused domain-centric knowledge to the context without involving the information in the associated domain chain. And TagRAG w/o fu- sion not only discards the knowledge of the domain chain, but also cuts off the object tag information connected to the retrieved domain tag. It relies entirely on the description
