A.3 Baselines To validate the performance and efficiency of global question answering, we compare TagRAG with the raw generation of three LLMs with dif- ferent parameter amounts and the following four RAG-based methods: • NaiveRAG(Lewis et al., 2020): NaiveRAG, focusing on local information, combines LLMs with external knowledge retrieval to enhance response accuracy and relevance by dynamically fetching context from databases or documents before generating answers. • GraphRAG(Edge et al., 2024): GraphRAG builds an entity graph with community sum- maries, retrieving and aggregating partial sum- mary responses into final answers. It grasps a complete global view and is capable of gener- ating synthesized responses. • LightRAG(Guo et al., 2025): LightRAG combines graph structures with text indexing for dual-level retrieval, enabling fast, relevant knowledge access and real-time updates in dynamic environments. It is compared as a representative of lightweight. • MiniRAG(Fan et al., 2025): MiniRAG is an efficient RAG system using semantic-aware graph indexing and lightweight topology- based retrieval for effective knowledge dis- covery with minimal semantic processing. As a comparison, it has excellent Graph-based RAG performance with small language mod- els. A.4 Predefined Root Domain Tag Details In Table 6, we list the root domains with their de- scriptions for the Domain Tag Chain Organization on the UltraDomain datasets. Domain Description Agri Agriculture: Agriculture is the culti- vation of crops and rearing of animals for food, fiber, and other products to sustain human life.
