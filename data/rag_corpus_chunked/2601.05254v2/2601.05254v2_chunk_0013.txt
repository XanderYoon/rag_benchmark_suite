GraphRAG, and LightRAG. Even against Mini- RAG, the strongest baseline, TagRAG maintains a dominant average winning rate, with MiniRAG retaining only 35.125%. (2)TagRAG excels at Di- versity, leveraging its domain knowledge integra- tion to access broader information for generation. Even when compared to GraphRAG, which tra- verses all communities, TagRAG maintains a clear advantage, suggesting that fusing knowledge via domain chains is superior to community-summary or path-discovery approaches.(3)TagRAG ex- pands the model capability, because it defeats 6 25 50 75 100 125 150 175 200 225 Graph Construction Time (Hours) 0 10 20 30 40 50 Inference Time (Hours) T agRAG GraphRAG LightRAG MiniRAG 0 20 40 60 80 100 Win Rate (%) 40
