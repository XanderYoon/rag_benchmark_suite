Details In Table 6, we list the root domains with their de- scriptions for the Domain Tag Chain Organization on the UltraDomain datasets. Domain Description Agri Agriculture: Agriculture is the culti- vation of crops and rearing of animals for food, fiber, and other products to sustain human life. CS Computer Science: Computer Science is the study of computational systems and algorithms, focusing on design- ing, analyzing, and applying software and hardware to solve complex prob- lems. Legal Legal: Legal refers to anything per- taining to law, its principles, regula- tions, or the formal administration of justice within a society. Mix All disciplines: All disciplines refers to the complete range of academic, professional, and practical fields of study, encompassing the humanities, sciences, arts, social sciences, tech- nologies, and applied domains that collectively constitute human knowl- edge and activity.

As seen in Table 7, GraphRAG, LightRAG and MiniRAG, that per- form quite well with qwen3-4b, exhibit catas- trophic global reasoning. This is due to the fact that both community summarization and path inference rely heavily on the capabilities of LLMs, causing these methods to perform poorly with lightweight models. On the contrary, in this low resource sit- uation, NaiveRAG still retains basic reasoning ca- pabilities. It can be seen that TagRAG can adapt to large language models with different parameter quantities and always has strong global reasoning capabilities. Agri CS Legal Mix Avg v.s.
