subsequent work has been improved in the following two aspects: (1)Structural simplifica- tion for graph construction.LightRAG (Guo et al., 2025) integrates lightweight graphs with text indexing and dual-level retrieval for efficient, adaptive knowledge access. KET-RAG (Huang et al., 2025b) combines a sparse knowledge graph skeleton with a text-keyword bipartite graph, en- abling multi-granular retrieval without building a full-scale graph. (2)Retrieval optimization for global knowledge.MiniRAG (Fan et al., 2025) unifies text and entity indexing into a semantic- aware graph, leveraging lightweight topology- enhanced search for efficient knowledge access. FG-RAG (Hong et al., 2025) extends entity cover- age via context-aware graph retrieval and improves response specificity with query-level fine-grained summarization. PathRAG (Chen et al., 2025) ex- tracts key relational paths and converts them into text prompts, guiding LLMs toward more coherent and context-aware generation. However, these approaches perform poorly in low-resource scenarios where smaller LLMs are deployed and are rarely explored on incremental knowledge.
