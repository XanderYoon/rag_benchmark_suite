After each round of increment, we generate diverse questions involving all current documents to test the global reasoning capabilities of different methods. In Figure 4, Tag RAG has a steady lead over Naive RAG, Graph RAG and Light RAG, with average winning rates reaching over 80%. Even though there is a close tie with TagRAG in the first round, MiniRAG loses as the documents increase. This proves that TagRAG has a stable global inference capability in incremen- tal scenarios with multiple rounds, as the mecha- nism of tag chain fusion naturally has the advantage of infinite scaling. 6.5 Retriever adaption analysis To demonstrate that our performance does not solely depend on the effect of a powerful searcher, we perform a retriever adaption analysis. As shown in Table 3, retrievers of different sizes are applied to the comparison. Even with a lower performance retriever, TagRAG still
