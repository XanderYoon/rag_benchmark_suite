si,Emb(s i)}|Vd| i=1, where Emb(·) is the embedding function, vi and si denote a domain tag and its summary, respectively. 4 4.1.4 Knowledge Incremental Insertion The TagRAG framework has a natural advantage in knowledge incremental insertion. Instead of di- viding communities from scratch, TagRAG can di- rectly embed newly constructed domain tag chains into the existing knowledge graph. The incremental process involves two components: • Tag increment: For the new extracted object tags or generated domain tags, TagRAG ap- pends new descriptions to the existing ones with the same name. • Knowledge increment: For the new fused domain-centric knowledge, TagRAG re- summarizes old and new summaries of do- main tags with the same name to generate new perceptions. Compared to the time-consuming full reconstruc- tion of GraphRAG, TagRAG’s incremental inser- tion mechanism is significantly more efficient. 4.2 Tag-guided Retrieval-Augmented Generation Following the global vision strategy, TagRAG uses tag-guided graph retrieval-augmented generation. As the existence of domain tags that carry global knowledge, TagRAG is more efficient than other summarization-based and walk-based methods. 4.2.1 Domain-centric Knowledge Retrieval Based on the domain-centric knowledge retrieval library, we can search domain knowledge related to the question: (V ′ t , S ′ t) =Ret tag(q,K), where V ′ t indicates the related domain tags, S ′ t rep- resents the related summaries, and Rettag(·) is the retrieval function with cosine similarity. 4.2.2 Hierarchical Tag Chain Integration Thanks to knowledge fusion, domain-centric knowledge already has global properties. How- ever, with the advantage of hierarchical knowledge graph, we are able to further extract higher-level global knowledge: (V ′ c , S ′ c) =Ret chain(V ′ t ), where Retchain(·) extracts the corresponding chains, V ′ c indicates the domain tags on the chain corre- sponding to V ′ t , and S ′ c represents the
