This makes the knowledge of the graphs they con- struct insufficiently connected to produce a global view. B.5 Visualization of Knowledge Graph Construction To better distinguish the methods, we visualize their knowledge graphs on UltraDomain Mix in Figure 5. Without a strong semantic parser, Ligh- tRAG with a smaller model extracts sparse entities and loose relations, yielding low-density graphs. GraphRAG and MiniRAG produce similar graphs. While GraphRAG adds global knowledge via com- munity summaries, MiniRAG is more effective on small models through tailored retrieval. Leveraging hierarchical links, TagRAG builds well-connected graphs with high knowledge density and broad cov- erage.
