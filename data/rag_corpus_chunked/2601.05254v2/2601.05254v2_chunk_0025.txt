connection of domain chains and the fu- sion of domain-centric knowledge can be adapted to low-resource scenarios. TagRAG liberates the dependence on LLMs for graph construction. B.3 Cross-domain incremental analysis Although it has been verified on the Mix dataset, we add a document from the UltraDomain CS dataset to the knowledge graph already constructed from the Mix dataset, to demonstrate the cross-domain capabilities of the comparative methods. After inte- grating the new data, we let the comparative meth- ods still answer the questions generated for the Mix dataset to determine whether they can fully utilize the incrementally constructed knowledge to make the responses better than before. In Table 9, TagRAG substantially outperforms the other three methods in terms of performance and achieves sub- optimal results in the time dimension. LightRAG, despite its time advantage, is limited by its polar- ized knowledge representation, which makes it dif- ficult to merge new knowledge well into the already existing framework, leading to the unsatisfactory incremental performance. GraphRAG unquestion- ably consumes the most time due to its large num- ber of LLM calls as well as community summa- rizations, and it struggles to incorporate knowledge from completely new domains into the established communities, leading to its poor performance. B.4 Statistics of Knowledge Graph Construction We report the scale of knowledge graphs con- structed by TagRAG and the baselines, as shown in Table 10. LightRAG extracts the least number of entities and relationships, resulting in its weakest knowledge representation. GraphRAG and Mini- RAG capture huge amounts of entities, but the rela- 12 Comprehensiveness Diversity Empowerment Overall Time-C Time-I GraphRAG 41.7 42.8 43.2 44.0 30.47 36.81 LightRAG 53.5 54.5 52.9 52.9 2.28 4.01 MiniRAG 53.9 53.2 52.9 54.1 9.83 8.80 TagRAG 56.1 56.1 56.8 58.0 6.37 2.47 Table 9: Cross-domain incremental analysis: winning rates(%) of results
