target_keyword: name of the target keyword, as summarized in step 1 - relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source keyword and the target keyword are related to each other Format each relationship as (“relationship”{tuple_delimiter}< source_keyword >{tuple_delimiter} < target_keyword >{tuple_delimiter}< relationship_description >) 3. Return output in {language} as a single list of all the keywords and relationships generated in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter. 4. When finished, output {completion_delimiter} —Examples— {examples} —Real Data— Text: {input_text} Output: Prompt of domain tag chain organization —Goal— Given a domain tag with its description and an object tag with its description, generate the relationship chain between them. Use {language} as output language. —Steps— 1. Generate the relationship chain between the domain tag and the object tag. Present all domain tags consisting of the following information: - domain_name: Name of the domain, use same language as input text. If English, capitalized the name. - domain_description: Comprehensive description of the domain tag. Format each domain tag as < domain_name > {explanation_delimiter}< domain_description > and connect domain tags with **{inference_delimiter}**. 2. Generate the relationship description between the object tag and the generated relationship chain in step 1. Use **{tuple_delimiter}** as the delimiter. 3. Return output in {language} as a single relationship chain generated in step 1 and a relationship description generated in step 2. 4. When finished, output {completion_delimiter} —Examples— {examples} —Real Data— Domain tag name: {domain_tag_name} Domain tag description: {domain_tag_description} Object tag name: {object_tag_name} Object tag description: {object_tag_description} Output: 20 Prompt of domain-centric knowledge fusion —Goal— Given a chain of domain tags with their descriptions, the summary of the chain, relevant object tags with their descriptions and the relationship descriptions, summarize the domain by injecting these object tags at a high level. Use {language} as output language. —Domain tag chain—
