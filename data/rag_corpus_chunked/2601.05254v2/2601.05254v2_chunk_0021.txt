Configuration CPU Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6330 CPU @ 2.00GHz GPU NVIDIA RTX A6000 48GB RAM 256GB Operating System CentOS Linux 7 CUDA 12.4 Python 3.10.16 Table 4: Experimental environment. A.2 Dataset Details We conduct experiments on four datasets, namely Agriculture, CS, Legal and Mix. Agriculture, CS and Legal describe expertise in their respective fields, while Mix mixes knowledge from 18 fields. As shown in Table 5, the Agriculture and CS datasets are comparable in size, with Legal being the largest and Mix being the smallest.
