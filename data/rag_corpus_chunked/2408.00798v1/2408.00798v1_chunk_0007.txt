data is added to the document database, making it more likely to retrieve relevant documents when queried (Figure 3). 3.2 Identify Jargons The first step in the online process involves identifying jargons and abbreviations within the user’s question. This step is essential because many domain-specific questions include special- ized terms that require clarification to ensure ac- curate interpretation. To identify these terms, we utilize a prompt template designed to instruct the LLM to extract and list all jargons and abbrevi- ations found in the input question. This process ensures that all potentially ambiguous terms are rec- ognized, facilitating their resolution in later steps. The identified jargons and abbreviations are out- putted in a structured format for further processing. 3 Get Question Identify Context Generate Query Query Jargon Retrieve Documents Generate AnswerSynthesize Response Respond Augment Question Yes No Miss Hit “What is the PUC architecture of Samsung or Hynix NAND chip?” From this question, identify any jargon and abbreviations, and list them in the following format: [“jargon1”, “jargon2,” …] .
