a query. Additionally, incorporating knowledge through fine-tuning necessitates a new fine-tuning job for each new piece of knowledge, which incurs computational costs and hinders efficient integration of new information. The amount of knowledge a model can effectively incorporate depends on the capacity of the fine-tuned model part (Roberts et al., 2020), while excessive fine-tuning may lead to catastrophic forgetting, where the model forgets previously learned knowledge (Zhai et al., 2024). In contrast, RAG does not suffer from these drawbacks. The Reversal Curse, observed in fine-tuning methods, does not occur when knowledge statements are presented in-context, as part of the prompt. In RAG, the LLM learns knowledge statements in-context, significantly improving its reasoning capacity and enabling efficient instruction prompt tuning (Singhal et al., 2023). Furthermore, RAG does not require model retraining and can efficiently incorporate new knowledge corpora. These properties make RAG a superior choice for industrial knowledge bases.
