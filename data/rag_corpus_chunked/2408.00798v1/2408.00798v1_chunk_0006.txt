fidelity, it is limited to SQL queries and does not generalize to broader question- answering scenarios. Figure 1 illustrates this limi- tation, showing that while the method can disam- biguate and structure queries more effectively, it is not applicable to general retrieval tasks where context and jargon interpretation are crucial. 3 Method Golden-Retriever consists of offline and online parts. The offline part is a data pre-processing step that occurs before the deployment of the knowledge base chatbot, described in Section 3.1. The online part is an interactive process that takes place every time a user asks a question, detailed in Sections 3.2 through 3.6. 3.1 LLM-Driven Document Augmentation The offline part of Golden-Retriever focuses on enhancing the document database to improve the relevance of retrieved documents. This process begins by collecting the company’s original docu- ments, such as slides, images with embedded text, and tables, to form the knowledge base. These documents are often varied in format and content, lacking a clear narrative, which can lead to low relevance scores when queried with RAG. To address this, we use OCR to extract text from these documents and split it into smaller, manage- able chunks for processing. For the Meta-Llama-3 model, these chunks are approximately 4,000 to- kens each. Each chunk is then processed using an LLM to generate summaries from the perspec- tive of a domain expert, leveraging the LLM’s se- mantic understanding and in-context learning abili- ties. This augmented data is added to the document database, making it more likely to retrieve relevant documents when queried (Figure 3). 3.2 Identify Jargons The first step in the online process involves identifying jargons and abbreviations within the user’s question. This step is essential because many domain-specific questions include special- ized terms that require clarification to ensure ac- curate interpretation. To identify
