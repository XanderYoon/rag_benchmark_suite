have been proposed. These methods combine the scores obtained from dense and sparse retrieval, typically through linear weighted fusion or techniques such as Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). For example, the Sawarkar et al. (2024) demonstrates that integrating semantic search techniques with sparse encoder indexes can significantly enhance retrieval performance on benchmarks such as NQ and TREC-COVID, leading to improved overall accuracy in RAG systems(Zhang et al., 2024). 3 M ETHODOLOGIES TO IMPROVE RETRIEVAL Fine-tuned Retriever Financial Dataset Corpora Passage Retrieval Tabular and Text Retrieval FinDER FinQABench FinanceBench TATQA FinQA ConvFinQA MultiHiertt Text data Table data Chunking Preprocessed Corpora Chunked Text data Markdown Formatting Expanded Query Vector DB Reranking Model Reranked Corpora Queries Similar Query #1 LLM Similar Query #2Query + + Embedding Retrieval Model Hybrid Retrieval Sparse DB Final AnswerLLM DPO Training Pre-retrieval Retrieval Post-retrieval Selection Agent Figure 1: Our enhanced RAG pipeline 3.1 P RE-RETRIEVAL Data Preprocessing A major shortcoming of conventional RAG approaches is their inability to effectively handle ambiguous queries and the heterogeneous structure of complex documents, lead- ing to issues such as ambiguity and structural fragmentation. Thus, preprocessing must enrich se- mantic context while reducing noise. Commonly used techniques such as query expansion(Wang et al., 2023), LLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023) and markdown formatting can significantly enhance re- trieval performance. Additionally, tabular data may require specialized modification to be effectively grounded(Singh & Bedathur, 2023). In this phase, various preprocessing methods are considered in- cluding novel modifications to both query and corpus. 3.2 R ETRIEVAL Model Selection and Fine-Tuning Embedding models often struggle to accurately interpret com- plex document structures such as tabular and graphical data, and lack sensitivity to domain-specific semantics. Thus, careful selection of a moderately large-scale, high-performing model—and fine-tuning it—are required to ensure base retrieval performance.
