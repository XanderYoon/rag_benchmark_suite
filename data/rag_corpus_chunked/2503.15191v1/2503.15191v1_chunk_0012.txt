Precision without reference employs GPT-4o mini to compare context chunks with the generated response, ensuring that relevant information is prioritized. A key component is our DPO-trained(Rafailov et al., 2023) GPT-4o mini. We generated answers using the gpt-4o-2024-08-06 at two temperature settings (0.1 and 1.0) for identical queries, then evaluated responses on financial terminology and clarity to divide preferred and non-preferred responses. These pairs were used to fine-tune gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18 via OpenAI’s API (beta = 0.1). 5 R ESULT Our experiment evaluation demonstrates that the enhancements introduced to the RAG framework yield substantial improvements in retrieving and processing domain-specific financial data. 5.1 R ETRIEVAL MODEL SELECTION Table 2: Performance comparison of retrievers MODELS NDCG@10 e5-large-v2 0.29746 GritLM 0.21262 FinBERT 0.25595 TAPAS 0.10124 stella 400M 0.32006 stella 1.5B 0.32178 We evaluated several candidate retrieval models on the FinanceRAG dataset using NDCG@10 (Ta- ble 2). Among the models tested, stella 1.5B achieved the highest NDCG score. It outperformed alternatives that either provided stable but suboptimal results or showed limitations in processing general textual content. For example, FinBERT, despite being fine-tuned on financial text, performed 6 Accepted at the ICLR 2025: Advances in Financial AI Workshop poorly compared to stella 1.5B. TAPAS excelled at handling tabular data but was less effective in overall text retrieval. 5.2 E MBEDDER FINE -TUNING Table 3: Comparison of NDCG@10 Performance for the Fine-tuned 400M & 1.5B Embedder MODELS NDCG@10 FT stella 400M* 0.40186 FT stella 1.5B* 0.50864 *Fine-Tuned Subsequent fine-tuning of the selected retrieval model further enhanced performance, as shown in Table 3. As a result, the fine-tuned version of “stella en 1.5B v5 (NovaSearch)”—referred to as FT stella 1.5B achieved an NDCG@10 score of 0.50864. This is a significant improvement over the baseline performance of the “stella en 400M v5 (NovaSearch)” model, which achieved an NDCG@10 score of
