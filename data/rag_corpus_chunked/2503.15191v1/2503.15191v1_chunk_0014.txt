than before. Despite enriching contextual information in cells, Table Augmentation led to excessive noise within the corpus. Similarly, Table Extraction assumed significance only in tabular data, discarding all other text. This suggests that fine-tuned retrievers can sufficiently understand knowledge in tabular data without the need for modification. 7 Accepted at the ICLR 2025: Advances in Financial AI Workshop These results indicate that, in the context of financial documents, using Query Expansion for queries and Markdown Restructuring for the corpus yields the best retrieval performance. 5.4 H YBRID RETRIEVAL (a) ConvFinQA (b) FinanceBench (c) FinDER (d) FinQA (e) FinQABench (f) MultiHiertt (g) TATQA Figure 2: α-NDCG@10 Graphs by each task Table 6: Comparison of optimal α and its following NDCG scores across the different datasets.

Table 6 illustrates the optimal α value and performance for each dataset. In Figure 2, subfigures from (a) to (g) illustrate the relationship between the α value (x- axis) and the corresponding NDCG score (y-axis). These graphs reveal that tasks requiring precise, fact-based retrieval generally achieved optimal performance at lower α values (emphasizing sparse retrieval), while those demanding deeper semantic interpretation performed best at higher α values (emphasizing dense retrieval). 5.5 R ERANKING Table 7 demonstrates the positive impact of reranking for each of the 7 tasks. Reranking the top- 20 retrieved documents yielded a positive impact across all seven tasks. In most tasks, reranking led to noticeably improved NDCG@10 scores, confirming the effectiveness of Cross-Encoders over BERT-based retrievers. However, while the total score was improved (Table 8), a slight perfor- mance drop
