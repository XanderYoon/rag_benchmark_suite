of corpus data presents unique challenges that necessitate tailored preprocessing strategies. Unlike approaches that apply a uniform treatment to all documents, recent studies have emphasized the importance of adapting preprocessing to the structural characteristics of the corpus—especially when dealing with diverse formats such as plain text and tabular data. Building on these insights, we explore various corpus preprocessing methods —preserving original formats markdown restructuring, table annotation, and table extraction. Our evaluation shows that markdown restructuring yields the best performance, highlighting the benefits of an optimized, data-driven pipeline. Overall, our framework addresses query ambiguity and document heterogeneity, improving retrieval accuracy in domain-specific applications. 2 Accepted at the ICLR 2025: Advances in Financial AI Workshop 2.3 H YBRID RETRIEVAL Recent advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have increasingly focused on overcoming the limitations of using a single retrieval modality by fusing the strengths of both dense and sparse retrieval approaches. Dense retrieval methods, which leverage semantic embeddings generated by models such as BERT(Devlin et al., 2019) or SentenceTransform- ers(Reimers & Gurevych, 2019), excel at capturing deep contextual relationships between queries and documents. However, they may sometimes fail to retrieve documents that contain precise terms, proper nouns, or abbreviations. In contrast, sparse retrieval techniques, employing methods like BM25(Wang et al., 2021), offer excellent keyword matching capabilities and provide high interpretability, although they often lack the ability to grasp nuanced semantic meaning. (Sengupta et al., 2024) To address these complementary weaknesses, hybrid retrieval methods have been proposed. These methods combine the scores obtained from dense and sparse retrieval, typically through linear weighted fusion or techniques such as Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). For example, the Sawarkar et al. (2024) demonstrates that integrating semantic search techniques with sparse encoder indexes can significantly enhance retrieval performance on benchmarks such as NQ and TREC-COVID, leading to improved overall
