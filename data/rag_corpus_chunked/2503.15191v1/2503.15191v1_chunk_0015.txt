Table 7 demonstrates the positive impact of reranking for each of the 7 tasks. Reranking the top- 20 retrieved documents yielded a positive impact across all seven tasks. In most tasks, reranking led to noticeably improved NDCG@10 scores, confirming the effectiveness of Cross-Encoders over BERT-based retrievers. However, while the total score was improved (Table 8), a slight perfor- mance drop was observed in certain tasks such as FinQABench, hinting at potential task-specific adjustments in reranking. 8 Accepted at the ICLR 2025: Advances in Financial AI Workshop Table 7: NDCG@10 for the initial retrieval stage versus the subsequent reranking stage (voyage- rerank-2) across various datasets.

Despite its smaller architecture, the DPO agent generated responses with en- hanced alignment to the input query and stronger support from the most pertinent contextual infor- mation, as shown in the Appendix A.3. The enhanced performance is also attributable to the targeted use of the selection agent to carefully utilize the top-10 documents. This integrated approach signif- icantly improves both the quality and efficiency of answer generation in financial tasks. 6 C ONCLUSION In this study, we presented an enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline designed specifically for financial question answering documents.
