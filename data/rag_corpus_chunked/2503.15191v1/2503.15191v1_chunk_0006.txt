both query and corpus. 3.2 R ETRIEVAL Model Selection and Fine-Tuning Embedding models often struggle to accurately interpret com- plex document structures such as tabular and graphical data, and lack sensitivity to domain-specific semantics. Thus, careful selection of a moderately large-scale, high-performing model—and fine-tuning it—are required to ensure base retrieval performance. Hybrid Retrieval Strategy Conventional RAG systems typically suffer from limitations stemming from their exclusive reliance on either dense or sparse retrieval techniques. Dense retrieval, which leverages continuous vector representations, excels at capturing deep semantic relationships but 3 Accepted at the ICLR 2025: Advances in Financial AI Workshop often struggles with precise keyword matching—especially when dealing with domain-specific terminology. In contrast, sparse retrieval methods, such as BM25 or SPLADE, are effective for exact keyword matching but tend to overlook the richer contextual and semantic nuances inherent in complex documents. These shortcomings can lead to suboptimal retrieval performance in specialized domains like finance, where both exact term matching and deep semantic understanding are essential. To address these issues, our method introduces a hybrid retrieval strategy that fuses the strengths of both dense and sparse retrieval. Stotal = α · Sdense + (1 − α) · Ssparse (1) where Sdense represents the dense retrieval score (e.g., embedding similarity), Ssparse represents the sparse retrieval score (e.g., BM25), and α is a hyperparameter ranging from 0 to 1 that determines the contribution of each retrieval method. By appropriately tuning α on a small subset, our hybrid approach can adapt to different query types, giving weight to either exact matching or deeper semantic interpretation when necessary. This strategy is backed up by ensemble learning principles, where combining complementary methods leads to a more robust and effective retrieval system. 3.3 P OST-RETRIEVAL Reranking Reranking aims to further capture relevancy by leveraging larger models on top-K retrieved
