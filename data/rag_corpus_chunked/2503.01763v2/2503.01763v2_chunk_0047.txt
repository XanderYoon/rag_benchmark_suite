Specifically, we follow these steps. We first invite three human experts with strong backgrounds in NLP and IR to manually craft seed instructions. These expert-crafted instructions form an initial example pool. For each task, we randomly sample a set of instructions from this pool as in-context learning examples. Using these examples, GPT-4o generates a new instruction tailored to the given task. The newly generated instruction is then appended back to the instruction pool to enhance instruction diversity. The detailed pseudo algorithm is provided in Alg. 1. Below, we provide a concrete example of the GPT-4o prompt used in our instruction construction process. The example of seed instructions and the generated instructions is provided in Table 8. # The prompt for GPT -4 o . Given a query , you need to design an instruction about 20 words that clearly indicates this is a task to retrieve tools capable of solving the query based on its content . The instruction should emphasize the task requirements and target outcomes of the query while incorporating the functional characteristics of the tools to help the system accurately match the appropriate tools . Below , I have provided the target tools ( i . e . , the labels for the query ) . Please analyze the key aspects of the query and the tool descriptions . Your instruction should implicitly highlight the task requirements and the characteristics of the target tools relevant to the query . Here is an output template that your should follow . Please note that the instruction should
