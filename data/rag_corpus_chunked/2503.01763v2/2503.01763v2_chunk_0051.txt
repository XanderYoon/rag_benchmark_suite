': ' Get the number of boards on a specific page . Default : 5. '}} , ' required ': []}}} Instruction : Given a ` pagination query ` task , retrieve tools that can list boards and their attributes by processing parameters such as page number and page size to return the requested information . B.7 Human annotation To ensure the quality of the generated instructions, we conduct human annotation to review them based on four key aspects listed in Table 3. For instructions deemed low-quality, human annotators manually revise them to improve accuracy and clarity. For a clear illustration, we provide concrete examples of handcrafted instructions, high-quality generated instructions, and low-quality generated instructions in Table 8. Below, we also provide the detailed human annotation guidelines used in our review process for reproducibility and transparency. # Human guidance for instruction quality annotation We ask you to evaluate the quality of the generated instructions based on the following four aspects . Please carefully assess each instruction and provide your judgment : ## Aspects for annotation 1. Hallucination Check : Does the instruction contain any incorrect or fabricated information about the target tools or the input query ? ( Are there any details in the instruction that do not align with the actual features of the target tools or the content of the input query ?) 2. Co mp reh en si ve ne ss of Tool Features : Does the instruction fully and accurately describe the features of all target tools mentioned in the query ? ( Are there any important features of the target tools that are missing or inadequately described in the instruction ?) 3. Accuracy of Tool Feature Description : Does the instruction correctly describe the features of the target tools ? ( Key question to ask
