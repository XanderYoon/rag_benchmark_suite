in functionality and documentation format, reflecting diverse scenarios for tool-use LLMs. For IR models, retrieving different types of tools may present varying levels of difficulty. Therefore, we categorize the collected datasets into these three types based on their paired toolset formats, resulting in three subsets of TOOL RET: TOOL RET-web, TOOL RET-code, and TOOL RET-customized. During evaluation, we report the performance of IR models on each subset to provide a fine-grained analysis. Below, we list the datasets included in each subset and provide detailed descriptions. B.2 T OOL RET-Web The TOOL RET-Web subset is constructed by integrating the following datasets, which contain tools in the form of Web APIs: • AutoTools-Food(Shi et al., 2024): Contains APIs related to food recipes, where LLMs must retrieve specific food-related tools to answer user queries. • RestGPT-TMDB (Song et al., 2023) and AutoTools-Movie(Shi et al., 2024): Includes web APIs from the TMDB platform, a movie database. Evaluation tasks require LLMs to retrieve tools to find relevant information about movies or celebrities and extract key evidence to answer given queries. • AutoTools-Weather(Shi et al., 2024): Features web APIs from a weather database. LLMs must invoke these APIs and gather responses to answer weather-related queries. • RestGPT-Spotify and AutoTools-Music (Shi et al., 2024): Contains web APIs from a music platform. Evaluation tasks require LLMs to retrieve tools for searching songs or albums based on user queries. • ToolBench (Qin et al., 2023): Comprises over 16,000 web APIs crawled from RapidAPI. Queries are generated by LLMs, with ground truth tools labeled for each query. • ToolLens (Qu et al., 2024a): A subset of ToolBench, where queries are annotated to evaluate tool functionality. • APIbank (Li et al., 2023b): Contains web APIs for daily personalized applications, such as alarm booking and database login. • MetaTool (ToolE)(Huang et al.,
