tools per task. While recent information retrieval (IR) techniques such as semantic matching (Qu et al., 2024a; Xu et al., 2024), can assist with tool retrieval, they are of- ten trained on ad-hoc tool-use datasets, lacking comprehensive evaluation on diverse scenarios, es- pecially for unseen tasks. To further explore the importance of tool retrieval, we conduct a pilot experiment on ToolBench (Qin et al., 2023). As shown in Figure 1, we observe that (i) the agent’s performance substantially drops when replacing the officially annotated toolset with the retrieved tools; and (ii) even strong retrievers like colbertv2 (San- thanam et al., 2021a), struggle to retrieve target tools effectively. These findings highlight the ne- cessity to (i) systematically evaluate IR models on diverse tool retrieval tasks; and (ii) analyze the impact of retrieval on the end-to-end task pass rate. In this work, we introduce TOOL RET, the first arXiv:2503.01763v2 [cs.CL] 26 May 2025 large-scale tool retrieval benchmark comprising 7.6k diverse retrieval tasks and a corpus of 43k tools, which comprehensively evaluates IR mod- els across diverse retrieval scenarios. Specifically, we collect query-tool datasets from the following sources: (i) Tool-use agent benchmarks from pub- lished research papers in AI conferences, such as ACL and NeurIPS; (ii) Related conference re- sources such as AppBench in EMNLP and Tool- Lens in CIKM; and (iii) Other publicly available datasets from the open-source community, e.g., HuggingFace. The collected data is carefully cu- rated to cover a wide range of practical tool require- ments, comprising diverse types of tool documen- tation, domains, and varying query lengths. Then, we standardize the format of all the collected tasks, aligning them with retrieval tasks similar to the for- mat in MTEB, where each retrieval task contains a query and target tools (e.g., labels).
