all instructions in our benchmark are of high quality and faithfully grounded in the original queries and target tools . C Large-scaling training dataset: T OOL RET-train We extend the data collection process from TOOL RET to incorporate the training sets of three mainstream tool-use datasets: ToolACE (Liu et al., 2024a), ToolBench (Qin et al., 2023), and APIGen (Liu et al., 2024b). These datasets are selected for their diversity in task types, tool categories, and query complexity, ensuring a comprehensive representation of real-world tool-use scenarios. After collecting and preprocessing the data, we ultimately collect over 200k training instances. Each instance consists of a query and a corresponding set of target tools. Next, we further pair each query with an instruction using our target-aware strategy (§ 3.3). This strategy generates instructions that explicitly guide the retrieval process by incorporating task-specific context and tool functionality descriptions. We report the basic statistics of TOOL RET-train in Table 7. We also show a training example of our TOOL RET-train. # Query : Is ' https :// www . apple . com ' available in the Wayback Machine on September 9 , 2015? # Instruction : Given a ` URL availability ` task , retrieve tools that check if a given URL is archived and accessible on a specific date in the Wayback Machine . # Target tools ( labels ) : [ '{ ' name ': ' availability ' , ' description ': ' Checks if a given URL is archived and currently accessible in the Wayback Machine .
