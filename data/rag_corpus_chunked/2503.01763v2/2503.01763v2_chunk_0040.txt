APIs crawled from RapidAPI. Queries are generated by LLMs, with ground truth tools labeled for each query. • ToolLens (Qu et al., 2024a): A subset of ToolBench, where queries are annotated to evaluate tool functionality. • APIbank (Li et al., 2023b): Contains web APIs for daily personalized applications, such as alarm booking and database login. • MetaTool (ToolE)(Huang et al., 2023): Designed to evaluate whether LLMs are aware of tool usage and can correctly select tools. • Mnms (Ma et al., 2024): Evaluates LLM-based agents’ tool-use abilities for multi-step, multi- modal tasks involving tools that process visual information. Since TOOL RET focuses on text-based IR models, images are represented using their URLs. • Reverse-Chain (Zhang et al., 2023): Contains diverse multi-step tasks requiring LLMs to invoke relevant tools sequentially. • ToolEyes (Ye et al., 2024a): Includes tools across various domains, such as advice, entertainment, and art, providing a broad evaluation of tool-use LLMs in practical scenarios. • UltraTool (Huang et al., 2024): A benchmark designed to improve and evaluate LLMs’ tool utilization abilities in real-world scenarios, focusing on the entire process of planning, creating, and applying tools in complex tasks. • T-Eval (Chen et al., 2023): A fine-grained benchmark assessing tool-use LLMs across multiple evaluation aspects, including instruction following, planning, reasoning, retrieval, understanding, and review. B.3 T OOL RET-Code The TOOL RET-code subset is constructed by integrating the following datasets, which contain tools in the form of code functions: • Gorilla-PyTorch (Patil et al., 2023): Contains various PyTorch functions (code snippets) as tools, evaluating LLMs’ ability to correctly combine PyTorch functions for solving deep learning tasks. The functions in this dataset are collected from the Python Torch package.
