and therefore need to be defined. Giving equal weights to the two losses is an effective and straightforward combination method which we used in our experiments. Combination (DR + Data augm. + CL) method consists of data augmentation combined with contrastive learning. Specifically, we propose alongside augmenting questions with typos to use the contrastive loss of Equation 2 that brings the representation of a question close to its typoed variations while keeping it distant from other distinct questions. The final loss is a weighted average of the three losses: L = 𝑤 1 · L1 + 𝑤 2 · L2 + 𝑤 3 · L3, (4) where L3 represents the data augmentation and is computed simi- larly to Equation 1 but for the typoed variation 𝑞+ of the original question 𝑞. For our experiments, we use an equal weighting setting for the weights 𝑤 1,𝑤 2, and 𝑤 3. 2.4 Simulating Typos To assess the robustness of the proposed methods, a large-scale dataset for passage retrieval with typoed questions is necessary. Unfortunately such a dataset does not exist, and therefore we build one by simulating typos over the original Natural Questions and MS MARCO datasets. In detail, we simulate typos produced by humans by augmenting the original questions in the dataset with synthetically generated typoed ones. In order to simulate typos, we apply the following transforma- tions that often occur in human-generated questions. • Random: Inserts, deletes, swaps, or substitutes a random character; e.g., committee → { copmmittee, commttee, comimt- tee, commitlee}. • Keyboard: Swaps a random character with those close to each other on the QWERTY keyboard; e.g., committee → comnittee. • Common misspellings: Replaces words with misspelled ones, defined in a dictionary of common user-generated misspellings; e.g., committee → comittee. 2.5 Implementation Details The DR model used in
