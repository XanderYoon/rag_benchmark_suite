We compare our best-performing approach against the aforementioned baseline. If our proposed approach only learns to ignore words with typos, then we argue that the performance of the baseline should be competitive to ours. In many cases, removing the typoed word can be a valid approach since the importance of words in a question varies. For instance, considering the question “Where was president Lincoln born?” we see that “Lincoln” is crucial for the meaning of the question while “was” adds no information. With that in mind, we study RQ3 with respect to the relative importance of the typoed words within the question.4 Our method does not simply learn to ignore words with typos since, as we can see from Figure 2, it consistently outperforms the baseline. Furthermore, Figure 2 highlights that when the importance of typoed words is low, simply ignoring them is a highly competitive approach. On the other hand, as the importance of the typoed words increases, the effectiveness of just ignoring these words decreases dramatically, to the extent that keeping the typoed words
