Questions, we use answer recall (AR) at the top-K retrieved passages [6, 14]. Answer recall measures whether at least one of the top-k retrieved passages contains the ground-truth answer. 2.3 Methods In this section, we describe the dual-encoder model we use for our experiments. Moreover, we present the three approaches we apply as extensions to this model in order to increase robustness. Dense Retriever (DR) is a dual-encoder BERT-based model used for scoring question-passage pairs [6]. Given a question𝑞, a rel- evant passage 𝑝+ and a set of irrelevant passages {𝑝− 1 , 𝑝− 2 , . . . , 𝑝−𝑛 }, the model learns to rank 𝑝+ higher than the negative passages via the optimization of the negative log-likelihood of the relevant passage: L1 (𝑞𝑖, 𝑝+ 𝑖 , 𝑝− 𝑖,1, · · ·, 𝑝− 𝑖,𝑛) (1) = − log 𝑒sim(𝑞𝑖,𝑝+ 𝑖 ) 𝑒sim(𝑞𝑖,𝑝+ 𝑖 ) + Í𝑛 𝑗=1 𝑒sim(𝑞𝑖,𝑝− 𝑖,𝑗 ) . Data Augmentation (DR + Data augm.) is one of the tradi- tional approaches for robustifying neural models. By exposing DR on questions with and without typos, the model learns to be in- variant to typos. Similar to Zhuang et al. [17], for each original correctly written question, on training time, we draw an unbiased coin. If the result is heads, we use the original question for training. If
