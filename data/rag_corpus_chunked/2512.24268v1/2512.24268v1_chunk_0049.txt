Using higher k can lead to better defense against the attacks. Here the original attack success rate was at95% under an AdvRAGgen semantic attack. This signifies the capability of the defense. Furthermore, RAGPart was able to afford a largerkwhich can result in lower computational overhead.

Hyperparameter Analysis: Effect ofm,δin RAGMask Table 11: Hyperparameter analysis on RAGMask (SR%): In this table we show effect ofδ, m in the RAGMask in utility preservation. The original SR is74%. Experiments were done on the FiQA dataset. Even though at largerδ RAGMask was able to preserve utility as seen below it lead to a lesser effectiveness against stronger attacks such the proposed AdvRAGgen. m= 10m= 15m= 20m= 25 δ= 0.01 66 65 66 66 δ= 0.05 73 73 72 71 δ= 0.1 74 74 74 74 δ= 0.5 74 74 74 74 Table 12: Hyperparameter analysis on RAGMask (ASR%): In this table we show effect ofδ, m in the RAGMask in defense.
