Hyperparameter Analysis: Effect of RAGPart vs Naive combination of fragments Table 13: RAGPart SR - RAGPart vs Naive combination of fragmentsin FiQA: The table shows that under majority voting aggregation, RAGPart better preserves utility compared to a naive combination across multiple retrievers.

Effect of Aggregation methods in Naive combination of fragments Table14:NaivecombinationoffragmentsSR-Intersectionbasedaggregationvsmajorityvotebasedaggregation in FiQA: While intersection-based aggregation offers better efficiency against attacks, it also leads to a significant drop in utility, making it a less ideal choice for aggregation.
