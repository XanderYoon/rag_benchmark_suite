RAGPart vs. Naive Baseline for Multiple Adversarial Documents Assuming np is the number of poisoned fragments in the adversarial documents, we analyze the robustness of both methods under a worst-case scenario. Specifically, we assume that at most one poisoned mix embedding appears in each column of thep×( N k )matrix. While this assumption can be relaxed in practice, we adopt it here for analytical simplicity. Under this setting, as long as thetotal number of poisoned mixesacross allna adversarial documents is less than na na+1 (N k ), the least frequent clean document will still appear more often than any individual poisoned document in the final embedding matrix. This condition ensures robustness of top-p retrieval: each poisoned document can contribute at most 1 na+1 (N
