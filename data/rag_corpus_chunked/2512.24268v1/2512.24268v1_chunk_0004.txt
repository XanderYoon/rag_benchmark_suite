at mitigating corpus poisoning, without modifying the LLM or relying on strong retriever assumptions. • Wedemonstratetheefficacyofthesedefensesacrosstwobenchmarkdatasetsandfourdistinctpoisoning strategies. In addition to evaluating against existing attacks, we introduce a stronger, interpretable poisoning attack—AdvRAGgen—and show that our defenses remain robust under this more challenging threat model. • We present a theoretical result demonstrating the superiority of RAGPart over a naive combinatorial approach that does not exploit the properties of dense retrievers. • We systematically analyze trade-offs between RAGPart and RAGMask in terms of defense effectiveness and computational efficiency, providing practical guidance for real-world deployment across various system constraints. 2.

(b) RAGPart Figure 2: Naive Combination Baseline vs. RAGPart: A toy example with N=3 and k=2. In this scenario, the naive combination approach is likely to retrieve the malicious document, since the poison persists in the raw text of many combined fragments (before embedding). In contrast, RAGPart benefits from additional robustness due to mean pooling over fragment embeddings, which can dilute the effect of poisoned fragments and prevent the malicious document from being retrieved under the same conditions. For illustration purposes, we assume that large inner product values (e.g., 24, 36) correspond to the document
