that RAGPart yields significantly more combinations ofN and k that satisfy the robustness condition compared to the naive baseline. Overall, we recommend using lower values ofN and higher values ofkin practice to minimize performance degradation. Table 2:Sufficient condition for robustness under the naive baseline withnp =2 .
