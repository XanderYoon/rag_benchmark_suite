In contrast, RAGPart remains robust under both aggregation strategies, making it a more practical defense. 9 RAGPart & RAGMask: Retrieval-Stage Defenses Against Corpus Poisoning in Retrieval-Augmented Generation aggregation can remove poisoned documents more effectively than majority vote-based aggregation. This is shown in Figure 6, where intersection-based aggregation leads to a larger drop in ASR for both the naive combination baseline and RAGPart. Due to the additional robustness of RAGPart, the difference between intersection-based and majority vote-based aggregation is minimal in that case, unlike in the naive baseline. However, when considering SR over golden documents, Figure 5 shows that intersection-based aggregation causes a larger drop in SR, making it unsuitable for practical deployment. Therefore, we adopt
