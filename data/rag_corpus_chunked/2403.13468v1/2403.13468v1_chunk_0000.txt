Open-domain question answering requires retrieval systems able to cope with the diverse and varied nature of questions, provid- ing accurate answers across a broad spectrum of query types and top- ics. To deal with such topic heterogeneity through a unique model, we propose DESIRE-ME, a neural information retrieval model that leverages the Mixture-of-Experts framework to combine multiple spe- cialized neural models. We rely on Wikipedia data to train an effective neural gating mechanism that classifies the incoming query and that weighs the predictions of the different domain-specific experts corre- spondingly. This allowsDESIRE-ME to specialize adaptively in multiple domains. Through extensive experiments on publicly available datasets, we show that our proposal can effectively generalize domain-enhanced neural models. DESIRE-ME excels in handling open-domain questions adaptively, boosting by up to 12% in NDCG@10 and 22% in P@1, the underlying state-of-the-art dense retrieval model.

Within this transforma- tion, one prominent application of neural models within IR systems is achieved through dense retrieval techniques that have shown promising results in situ- ations where understanding the semantic context of queries and documents is crucial for accurate retrieval. In contrast to their traditional counterparts, which heavily rely on lexical similarities captured by scoring functions such as TF-IDF or BM25, dense retrieval techniques naturally capture query and document se- mantics and can be easily adapted to handle multi-modal data and
