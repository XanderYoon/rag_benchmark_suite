In our experiments, we relied on Wikipedia corpora and categories; our label- ing process is however not exportable to other cases. Consequently, given the diversity in real-world queries and documents our insights could be not directly generalizable to other settings. Future research could address this issue by evalu- ating DESIRE-ME on more diverse and extensive datasets. This would require extensive user studies and crowd-sourcing to label query domains or topics. An- other option would be using LLMs to create soft labels for queries [11]. Another future research topic is query augmentation, which can be addressed by adapt- ing the DESIRE-ME specializer modules to domain-specific query expansion modules. This way, the query expansion would occur by using models that can leverage domain-specific vocabularies.
