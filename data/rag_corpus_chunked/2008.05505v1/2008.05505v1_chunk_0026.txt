a distinct group of its own. Red is perceived as significantly distinct from any other color, which was not the case for either bunny model. The perceived depth of the sphere is also more affected by luminance compared t o the complex bunny shapes. None of the bright colors are in a perceptually similar group ing as its darker counterpart. The complex shapes have many groupings that include both dark and bright color s, unlike the sphere. H1 (Shape) is supported for the high -fidelity objects . The depth perception of complex shapes may not be affected by color and luminance as much as a simple shape due to the presence of other depth cues such as shadows and contours. The bunny has m ultiple grooves and curves in the mesh, which give the viewer more shadows and highlights, causing them to rely less on color and luminance. Our results support H2 (Fidelity). Increased fidelity increased perceptual differences among the color and luminan ce conditions for both shapes, as indicated by the number of groupings. The low- fidelity cube had only 1 total grouping, while the high -fidelity sphere had 5 total groupings and 3 distinct non -overlapping groupings. The low -fidelity bunny had 4 total group ings and 2 distinct groupings, while the high -fidelity bunny had 7 total groupings and 3 distinct groupings. A higher number of groupings indicates that participants observed more perceptual differences. Furthermore, the overall scores for red notably incr eased from the low fidelity to the high -fidelity versions of both shapes, showing that fidelity may have some effect on depth perception. Additionally, the overall scores for dark yellow notably decreased from the low fidelity to the high-fidelity versions of both shapes. H3 (Color) was not supported by our results. Warm colors of the
