scores for red notably incr eased from the low fidelity to the high -fidelity versions of both shapes, showing that fidelity may have some effect on depth perception. Additionally, the overall scores for dark yellow notably decreased from the low fidelity to the high-fidelity versions of both shapes. H3 (Color) was not supported by our results. Warm colors of the same luminance were not perceived as closer than cool colors for all objects, except for red in the sphere condition. H4 (Luminance) was partially supported by our results. Except for the cube, most of the bright colors were perceived as significantly closer than their darker counterparts. For the sphere, all of the bright colors were perceived as closer. For the low -poly bunny, magenta, blue, and re d were perceived closer than their darker counterparts, but green, cyan, and yellow were not. For the high-poly bunny, red, blue, green, and magenta were perceived closer than their darker counterparts. Only cyan and yellow were not perceived as significan tly closer than their counterparts. Even for the cube, which had only one total grouping, the brighter colors have higher scores than their darker counterparts. Our relatively low sample size is the most likely cause for the lack of significant differences among all bright and dark color counterparts. 4.2 Discussion Our preliminary results indicate that the shape and fidelity of 3D virtual objects interact with color and luminance to affect depth perception in handheld mobile AR. Color and luminance are well- studied depth cues, but the influence of these depth cues can vary depending on the shape and fidelity of a 3D object. A very warm color, such as red, affects the depth perception of a high-fidelity, simple shape, but only when the color is bright. The w armth and coolness of a
