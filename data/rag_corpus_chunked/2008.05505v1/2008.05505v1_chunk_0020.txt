users. All devices are recent phones released within the last five years and are running at least Android 4.4 or above. The AR application was developed using the Unity game engine and the Vuforia AR engine. Table 3: Overview of specifications of devices used in our study.

Tablets were not used in the experiment due to the differences observed in depth perception between mobile phones and tablets in handheld AR [11]. Although screen resolution varies substantially across the devices, Dey et al. [11] noted that screen resolution did not affect depth perception in handheld AR. Participants were asked to print an 8.5 in. x 11 in. sheet of paper that contained two image targets. Two versions of the same virtual object were placed above the image targets for pairwise comparisons. The background of the paper was a neutral grey. The application set screen brightness to max and controlled the angle of the objects to the camera (i.e., no object is angled towards the camera more than the other). Participants were asked to position the image targets in the center of the screen at the beginning of each condition and were required to recalibrate if they moved away by more than 5% of the screen. Minor movement was permitted, and virtual objects had motion parallax consistent with the real world. The s
