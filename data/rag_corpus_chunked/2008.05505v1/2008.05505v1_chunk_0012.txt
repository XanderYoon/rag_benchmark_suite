3D object in the scene, which our study addresses. 3 HANDHELD MOBILE AR DEPTH PERCEPTION STUDY We conducted a paired comparison experiment to determine the effects of object shape, fidelity, color, and luminance on depth perception of 3D objects in handheld mobile AR. We expected simple shapes to be more affected by color and luminance than complex shapes and high-fidelity objects to be more affected than low-fidelity objects. We expected warm colors to still be perceived as nearer than cool colors of the same luminance, and we expected that brighter colors would be perceived nearer than darker colors, regardless of shape, fidelity, and color hue. 3.1 Paired Comparison Method The method of paired comparisons is a well -regarded scaling method that places objects along a continuum of quality [14]. An object’s placement depends on the degree that it exhibits some common property, which can be any qualitative or quantitative attribute that ca n be compared between objects [48, 56] . This method presents two objects to a participant and asks them to select the object that more exhibits the tested property. This procedure is then repeated for all pairs of objects [48]. The paired comparison method was first introduced by Thurstone in 1927 [56] and has since been expanded on several times [48, 49]. It has been used in many experiment s that analyze visual stimuli with some examples being [3, 27, 28, 43, 58]. It has also been used to analyze depth perception in particular [3, 28]. We decided on using the paired comparison method due to the nature of our experiment. Ledda et al. [27] presented strong reasoning for using this method. Mantiuk et al. [32] compared multiple subjective methods (single -stimulus, double -stimulus, forced-choice pairwise comparison, and similarity judgments) for image quality assessment and concluded that the
