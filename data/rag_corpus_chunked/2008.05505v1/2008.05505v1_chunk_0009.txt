More recent studies have investigated depth perception of virtual object s. In Table 1 , we provide a brief overview of these studies. Most of these studies used a desktop monitor and did not focus on the properties of 3D virtual objects, such as shape and fidelity. Additionally, we explore both color hue and luminance as depth cues. One of the earliest studies using virtual stimuli was executed by Dengler and Nitschke [10]. They investigated the effect s of background luminance on the traditional warm -cool depth effect. In an experiment involving simple 2D lines and boxes, they found that warm colors appeared closer on a black backgrou nd, but cool colors appeared closer on a white background [10]. This effect was consistent with earlier non-virtual observations by Hartridge [20]. Some studies have explored the interaction of multiple depth cues using simple 2D stimuli . Dresp et al. [13] proposed that the luminance contrast of an object against the scene is a principal pictorial cue, even when there are other depth cues in the scene , such as occlusion and interposition . Objects with a higher luminance contrast were more likely to be selected as near , regardless of other depth cues [13]. Guibal and Dresp [19] later
