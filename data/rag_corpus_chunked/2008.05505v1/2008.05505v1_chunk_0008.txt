2.2 Color Hue and Luminance as Depth Cues Most previous experimental work on color hue and luminance as depth cues was done in the mid-19th century. These studies largely followed a similar consensus: warm colors are perceived as nearer than cool colors and bright colors are perceived as nearer than dark colors [8, 20, 23, 30, 33, 37, 38, 54, 57] . Multiple studies have indicated that the difference in luminance contrast between an object and the background causes this effect, and the majority of these studies used dark backgrounds [15, 21, 34] . Many of these early studies examined simple 2D stimuli, such as shapes or letters, but the effects of color hue and luminance on depth pe rception have also been noted in real 3D objects [23, 33]. There exists some evidence that the effects of color on depth perception can be reversed depending on luminance. Pillsbury and Schaefer [41] proposed that blue light is perceived as closer than red light. Olgunturk [36] argued that this phenomenon is due to the Purkinje shift, where blue light appears brighter than red light at low luminance levels. Both Olgunturk [36] and Payne [39] have proposed that luminance is a stronger depth cue than color , which explains the results of Pillsbury and Schaefer [42].
