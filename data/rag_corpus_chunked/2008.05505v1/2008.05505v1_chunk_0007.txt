inconsistent and that consistent depth cues may improve depth perception in AR. Adams focused on shadows as depth cues, while our study focuses on color and luminance. More recently, there has been interest in examining depth perception in handheld mobile AR. Swan et al. [52] were the first to investigate distance judgments o f real and virtual objects in a tablet AR system . They found that a user’s picture perception in tablet-based AR devices is fundamentally different than HMD - based VR and AR . Dey et al. [11] studied the effect of resolution and display size on depth perception in handheld mobile AR and found that resolution had no significant effect, but that a smaller display size caused less underestimation. Participants in this experiment used either a mobile phone or tablet [11]. Liu et al. [29] investigated depth perception of virtual objects in handheld augmented AR and noted that virtual objects were perceived as further than real object. Berning et al. [4] investigated the effects of stereoscopic handheld mobile AR on depth perception and proposed that depth judgment is mostly influenced by monoscopic depth cues. Although they did not study color and luminance as a depth cue in AR, they noted that these cues may have influenced their results and should be studied further [4]. Our study directly addresses this issue to determine if color and luminance ha ve effects on depth perception in handheld mobile AR systems. 2.2 Color Hue and Luminance as Depth Cues Most previous experimental work on color hue and luminance as depth cues was done in the mid-19th century. These studies largely followed a similar consensus: warm colors are perceived as nearer than cool colors and bright colors are perceived as nearer than dark colors [8, 20, 23, 30, 33, 37, 38, 54,
