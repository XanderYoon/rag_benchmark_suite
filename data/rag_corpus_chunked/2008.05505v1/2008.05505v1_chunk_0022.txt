comparison experiment that also evaluated depth perception [59]. Both the ordering of the pairs shown and the positions (left or right) of the color conditions within the pair was randomized to prevent any bias. This procedure was outlined by Dunn -Rankin et al. [14]. After all pairs of color conditions were presented to the participant, they were given the next object model in the ir assigned ordering. This process was repeated for all four models. 3.8 Participants We recruited 16 unpaid volunteers (8 females, 8 males). Their mean age was 24.76 years, within a range from 21 to 35. Based on self - reported background data, 13 of the participants played video games with 3D models on a regular basis (i.e., at least one hour per week). All participants reported having normal or corrected vision and no color deficiencies (e.g., color blindness). Each participant was assigned to one of four ordering cohorts to counterbalance presentation order of the four models. 4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 4.1 Results For each model, the preference matrices of all participants were tabulated in a combined preference matrix. This combi ned preference matrix adds the scores of all participants together. In Figure 5, we show the total scores of each color in every model. This score indicates how many times a color was selected over another color. 0 shows the statistical tests of all models. Although the average coefficient of consistency for each model is not very high, this is to be expected because several colors have similar perception and cannot be told apart. For example, the dark colors for most models generally have similar scores and it is likely that they are similar in terms of perception. We used a forced-choice pairwise comparison design without the possibility of ties, which may have cause d participants
