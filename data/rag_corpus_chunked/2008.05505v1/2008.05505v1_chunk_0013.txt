to analyze depth perception in particular [3, 28]. We decided on using the paired comparison method due to the nature of our experiment. Ledda et al. [27] presented strong reasoning for using this method. Mantiuk et al. [32] compared multiple subjective methods (single -stimulus, double -stimulus, forced-choice pairwise comparison, and similarity judgments) for image quality assessment and concluded that the pairwise comparison method was the most accurate, time efficient, and least subject to measurement variance. 3.2 Experimental Design We conducted a 2 x 2 x 6 x 2 within-subject experiment to evaluate the effects of object shape (2 shapes), fidelity (2 levels), color (6 hues), and luminance (2 levels) on depth perception for handheld mobile AR applications. 3.2.1 Object Shape and Fidelity Table 2: The object shape and fidelity conditions used in our study. Fidelity Low High Shape Simple Cube Sphere Complex Low-poly Bunny High-poly Bunny Figure 1: The models used in our paired comparisons study. We investigated the effects of object shape at two levels: a simple sphere and the complex Stanford bunny. For the simple sphere, we used a high -poly sphere (768 triangles) for the high -fidelity condition and a cube (12 triangles), which is the lowest polyhedral approximation of a sphere [16], for the low -fidelity version of the sphere. For the complex bunny, we used the original high -poly version ( 69,630 triangles) for the high -fidelity condition and a reduced low -poly version ( 4,968 triangles) for the low -fidelity condition. Table 2 provides a summary of the four object conditions used in our study, and Figure 1 depicts the corresponding models. Every participant completed four paired comparison tasks, one for each model, involving color hue and luminance, as described in the next section. To avoid potential ordering effects, such as learning or boredom,
