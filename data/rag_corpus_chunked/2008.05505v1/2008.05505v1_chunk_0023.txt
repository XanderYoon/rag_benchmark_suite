very high, this is to be expected because several colors have similar perception and cannot be told apart. For example, the dark colors for most models generally have similar scores and it is likely that they are similar in terms of perception. We used a forced-choice pairwise comparison design without the possibility of ties, which may have cause d participants to create circular triads when presented with perceptually similar colors. The average coefficient of consistency can only tell us how reliably individual colors can be ranked. We analyzed the average number of circular triads using the over all circularity test as described in [14] and rejected the null hypothesis 𝐻0 that participants have the same circularity as choosing by chance with α = 0.05 level and 11 degrees of freedom for all four models. Thus, we can conclude that participants do have some consistency. Table 4: Overview of statistical analysis for all models. Coeff Cons (ave) 𝜁 Coeff Agr u 𝜒2 Significance p, 66 df Cube 0.311 0.003 68.5 > 0.1 Sphere 0.425 0.095 160.50 < 0.001 Low-poly Bunny 0.305 0.021 86.5 < 0.05 High-poly Bunny 0.373 0.091 156.26 < 0.001 We analyzed the significance of the coefficient of agreement u for all models using an approximation as described in Section 3.5.1. If the p-value of the coefficient of agreement u is significant, then we can create groups of perceptual similarity, where all colors in a group are not perceived significantly differently. For the sphere, low-poly bunny, and high -poly bunny, we can reject the null hypothesis 𝐻0 at α = 0.05 level for 66 degrees of freedom to conclude that there is some agreement amongst participants. The p- value of the cube’s coefficient of agreement was not significant, so we cannot conclude that there is agreement between participants, and
