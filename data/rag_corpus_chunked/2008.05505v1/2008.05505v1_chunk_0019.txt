then they would have created a circular triad. Inconsistency can frequently occur when the items being compared are similar and it is difficult to make judgments. We calculated a coefficient of consistency ζ as defined by Kendall and Babington [48] for even 𝑛, where 𝑐 denotes the number of circular triads: ζ = 1 − 24c n3 − 4𝑛 (4) We can determine the number of circular triads using the following formula [9]: c = 𝑛 24 (𝑛2 − 1) − 1 2 ∑(𝑝𝑖 − (𝑛 − 1)/2)2 (5) where 𝑛 is defined as the number of colors and 𝑝𝑖 is the score of each color. It is important to note that participants can have a high coefficient of agreement 𝑢 while having a low coefficient of consistency ζ . Participants can individually make inconsistent decisions (i.e., make circular triads) and still have a high 𝑢 if they overall agreed on these inconsistent decisions . ζ ∈ [0,1], where a coefficient of 1 indicates perfect consistenc y. ζ tends towards 0 as inconsistency increases. We can use ζ to learn useful information about the similarity of colors being tested. We can expect a low value if colors are perceptually similar, which makes selection a difficult task. 3.6 Apparatus Due to COVID -19, p articipants were instructed to use their own Android device . In 0, we list all the screen display size and resolution of all devices and number of users. All devices are recent phones released within the last five years and are running at least Android 4.4 or above. The AR application was developed using the Unity game engine and the Vuforia AR engine. Table 3: Overview of specifications of devices used in our study.
