significantly differently. For the sphere, low-poly bunny, and high -poly bunny, we can reject the null hypothesis 𝐻0 at α = 0.05 level for 66 degrees of freedom to conclude that there is some agreement amongst participants. The p- value of the cube’s coefficient of agreement was not significant, so we cannot conclude that there is agreement between participants, and therefore cannot create groups of perceptual similarity or state that any colors are perceptually different. A possible reason is that the cube is less susceptible to color and luminance as depth cues due to the sharp edges and shadows. Figure 5: Bar graphs of t otal scores of each color condition per model. Colors are ordered from greatest score to least score . Perceptually similar groupings of models are presented, excluding the cube. Any colors whose scores are underlined are similar. Table 5: Overview of total number of groupings and the largest number of distinct, non-overlapping groupings. Total Groupings Distinct Groupings Cube 1 1 Sphere 5 3 Low-poly bunny 4 2 High-poly bunny 7 3 The cube was unable to be evaluated because the p-value of the coefficient of agreement u was not significant. Therefore, w e cannot state that there is any difference in depth perception between color conditions for the cube. The groupings of colors for th e sphere, low-poly bunny, and high-poly bunny are shown in Figure 5. We created groupings using the least significant difference method outlined by Starks and David [49], at the α = 0.05 level. Table 5 shows the total number of groupings and largest number of distinct, non-overlapping groupings for each model . Note that the cube only has 1 grouping total as we cannot conclude that there is any difference in depth perception between color conditions. We evaluate d our hypotheses
