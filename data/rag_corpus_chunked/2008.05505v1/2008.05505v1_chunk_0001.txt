for a high-fidelity, simple 3D object, regardless of hue. Additionally, bright red is perceived as nearer than any other color . These effects were not observed for a low-fidelity version of the simple object or for a more-complex 3D object. High-fidelity objects had more perceptual differences than low-fidelity objects, indicating that fidelity interacts with color and luminance to affect depth perception . These findings reveal how the properties of 3D models influence the effects of color and luminance on depth perception in handheld mobile AR and can help developers select colors for their applications.

This phenomenon has been documented by psychology and vision researchers dating back to the 19th century [2, 5] and artists such as Leonardo Da Vinci used these depth cues in his work [31]. Depth perception of virtua l objects is an important factor to a user’s experience in visual applications, especially in extended reality where users expect their actions in the virtual space to match the physical space [55]. Kruijff et al. [26] have described depth distortion as one of the most common problems in augmented reality (AR). For example, Swan et al. [53] observed that users had difficulty depth matching virtual objects. Singh et al. [47] have also conveyed the importance of accurate depth perception in AR and provided examples of AR applications that require depth matching between re al and virtual objects. Similarly, Kalia et al. [24] remarked that inaccurate depth perception poses a problem in medical AR applications and causes difficulty for users . Hebborn et
