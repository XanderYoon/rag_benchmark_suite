4,968 triangles) for the low -fidelity condition. Table 2 provides a summary of the four object conditions used in our study, and Figure 1 depicts the corresponding models. Every participant completed four paired comparison tasks, one for each model, involving color hue and luminance, as described in the next section. To avoid potential ordering effects, such as learning or boredom, we counterbalanced the presentation order of the four models between subjects using a Latin squares design. 3.2.2 Color Hue and Luminance We selected six color hues representing the spectrum of colors. We chose three warm colors (red, magenta, and yellow) and three cool colors (green, blue, and cyan). We included both a bright and dark version of each color, giving us a total of 12 color conditions. All colors were luminance-balanced for both bright and dark versions. All objects were virtually illuminated with a white (#FFFFFF) directional light that had an intensity value of 1.0. We used the same AR target background for each object so that the differences in luminance conditions created contrast. Figure 2: The color conditions used for the paired comparisons. A color is displayed with its given abbreviation and hex color code. 3.3 Task Evaluation Figure 3: Example preference matrix for one participant when shown 12 color conditions of a given model. Each color in a row is compared with all other colors to establish a preference score. Paired comparison experiments require participants to select between two objects based on a shared quality, as explained in Section 3.1. We pr esented the participant with two differently colored versions of the same virtual object via a handheld mobile AR interface and asked them to select the object that appeared closer to them. The participants were instructed to evaluate all possible comparison pairs from the set of color
