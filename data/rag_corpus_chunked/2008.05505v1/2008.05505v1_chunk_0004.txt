In this paper, we investigate the effects of object shape, fidelity, color, and luminance on depth perception of 3D objects in handheld mobile AR. Mobile handheld AR has become popular due to the ubiquitous nature of smartphones [45]. Advances in mobile technology and affordability have allowe d mobile AR to become increasingly common in a variety of fields [7, 40]. Evaluating depth perception in mobile handheld AR will provide useful and ecologically valid results that can help developers choose colors in applications. In order to evaluate depth perception, we conducted a preliminary paired comparison experiment t o group colors into distinct groups of similar perception. We administered this procedure for objects of varying shape and fidelity. The results of our study indicate that there is some interaction between properties of 3D models and the effects of color a nd luminance on depth perception. For a simple, high-fidelity 3D shape, bright colors were 1 tiffanydo@Knights.ucf.edu 2 jjl@eecs.ucf.edu 3 rpm@ucf.edu perceived as nearer than dark color s, regardless of hue. Additionally, red was perceived as nearer than any other color, but this only occurred when the luminance wa s high. This effect was not observed for a low-fidelity version of the simple shape or for a complex 3D shape. There does not seem to be an effect of color on complex 3D shapes. However, there appears to be some effect of luminance on complex 3D shapes, as a color will generally appear closer than a darker version of the same color, regardless of fidelity. 2 RELATED WORK 2.1 Depth Perception in AR and VR Depth perception has been a widely studied topic in AR and virtual reality (VR), but most work has focused on HMDs [4]. Swan et al. [51] provided an excellent overview of previous work of depth perception in AR
