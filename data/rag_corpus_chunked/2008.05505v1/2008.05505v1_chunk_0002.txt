depth matching virtual objects. Singh et al. [47] have also conveyed the importance of accurate depth perception in AR and provided examples of AR applications that require depth matching between re al and virtual objects. Similarly, Kalia et al. [24] remarked that inaccurate depth perception poses a problem in medical AR applications and causes difficulty for users . Hebborn et al. [22] have also expressed how inaccurate rendering of virtual objects often breaks the illusion of co-existence in AR applications, further providing compelling reasons to ensure that d epth perception of virtual objects is accurate . Although most of these works have focused on head-mounted displays (HMDs), there has been recent interest in examining handheld mobile displays as well [4, 11, 12, 18] . In this paper, we use the term “handheld mobile AR” to refer to smartphone and tablet systems used to display virtual content over views of the real world provided by a back - facing camera [45]. Due to the importance of depth perception in AR, it is useful to investigate depth cues, such as color and luminance. The warmth and coolness of a color has a notable effect on depth perception. Several studies have indicated that warm colors, such as red, are perceived as nearer to a user while cool colors, such as blue, are perceived further away [5, 10, 20, 50] . Due to this effect, these colors have been respectively referred to as “advancing” colors and “retiring”/“retreating” colors by vision researchers [30, 37, 41] . Luminance is a well-studied depth cue and there is some evidence that suggests that it is a stronger depth cue than color hue [35, 38]. We refer to luminance as the relative brightness and darkness of a color, where a bright color has high luminance and a dark color
