object to appear closer than another simple object, they should ensure that the lumin ance of both objects is equal and that the color is not bright and warm . These findings can also be used to improve applications if distinct depth perception of objects is required. Kalia et al. [24] implemented an excellent example in which they used warm colors to represent closer objects and cool colors to represent further objects in medical images displayed on a desktop monitor. Our findings could help improve such an application where developers want to further emphasize depth using depth cues . If developers understand the effects of color and luminance on 3D objects, they can properly utilize these cues to their advantage. 4.3 Limitations Due to the outbreak of COVID -19, we were unable to run a laboratory study. Users participated in this study remotely using their own mobile devices. There are differences among the devices, such as max screen brightness and screen color accuracy, that may have affected our results. Additionally, our sample size was relatively low, which likely decreased the number of potential color groupings. However, we believe that these preliminary results are ecologically valid and could possibly represent the effect of object shape, fidelity, color, and luminance on depth perception in the real world. Additionally, our user study only had 16 subjects and more subjects would probably provide more information and potentially more differences among the conditions. 5 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In this paper, we presented a comparison of the effects of object shape, fidelity, color, and luminance on depth perception of 3D objects in handheld mobile AR. To determine these effects, we conducted a paired comparison experiment. The results of ou r study indicates that the shape and fidelity of 3D virtual objects interact with color and
