to a total of 264 comparisons. 3.4 Research Questions and Hypotheses RQ1: How does the shape of a 3D model interact with color and luminance as depth cues? H1 (Shape): Simple shapes will be more affected by color and luminance as depth cues than complex shapes . Previous work found that a realistic 3D object was less subject to the effects of color as a depth cue than a 2D square, indicating a relationship between complexity and depth cues [3]. We expect that simple shapes will demonstrate classical effects of color and luminance as depth cues (i.e., warm colors are closer than cool colors, and bright colors are closer than dark colors), while complex shapes may demonstrate these effects to a lesser degree. RQ2: How does the fidelity of a 3D model interact with luminance and color as depth cues? H2 (Fidelity): High-fidelity objects will be more affected by color and luminance as depth cues than low -fidelity objects . Because related work indicated that a high -fidelity 3D object was easier to judge depth than a low -fidelity object [25], we expect that high - fidelity models will demonstrate classical effects of color and luminance as de pth cues, while low -fidelity models may demonstrate these effects to a lesser degree. RQ3: How does the color of a 3D model affect its perceived depth? H3 (Color): Warm colors will be perceived as nearer than cool colors of the same luminance . We expect that warm bright colors will be perceived as nearer than cool bright colors, while warm dark colors will be perceived as nearer than cool dark colors. Previous studies propose that luminance is a stronger depth cue than co lor [35, 38], so we expect that this phenomenon will only occur at the same luminance level. RQ4:
