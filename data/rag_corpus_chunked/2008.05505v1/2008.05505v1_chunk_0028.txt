handheld mobile AR. Color and luminance are well- studied depth cues, but the influence of these depth cues can vary depending on the shape and fidelity of a 3D object. A very warm color, such as red, affects the depth perception of a high-fidelity, simple shape, but only when the color is bright. The w armth and coolness of a color did not affect a complex shape , supporting results found by Bailey et al . [3] where the perceptual depth of a realistic 3D virtual object was not affected by color . High-fidelity objects had more perceptual differences than low -fidelity objects, indicating that fidelity interacts with color and luminance as depth cues. We could not determine if the depth perception of the low - fidelity, simple 3D object (the cube) is affected by both color and luminance. The structure of the cube presents strong linear and angular information that is not available in the smooth, continuous curvature of the sphere, which likely explains the lack of significant differences for the cube. For all other models, all bright colors had higher total scores than dark colors, excluding yellow. We used the same background for all stimuli to create luminance contrast, which may have caused the bright colors to have higher scores. AR d evelopers shou ld choose colors with caution if depth perception is important to the user experience. For example, if a developer does not want a simple object to appear closer than another simple object, they should ensure that the lumin ance of both objects is equal and that the color is not bright and warm . These findings can also be used to improve applications if distinct depth perception of objects is required. Kalia et al. [24] implemented an excellent example in which they used warm
