colors and “retiring”/“retreating” colors by vision researchers [30, 37, 41] . Luminance is a well-studied depth cue and there is some evidence that suggests that it is a stronger depth cue than color hue [35, 38]. We refer to luminance as the relative brightness and darkness of a color, where a bright color has high luminance and a dark color has low luminance. Several studies have indicated that bright colors are perceived as nearer to a user, while dark colors are perceived as further [2, 8, 54] . This phenomenon occurs due to the luminance contrast between the object color and the background [34]. Multiple studies have indicated that a color with a higher luminance contrast to the background is perceived as further than a color with a lower luminance contrast [15, 21, 34]. While the effects of color and luminance as depth cues have been thoroughly studied, much of the work done has investigated real objects [2, 8, 37, 54] . Previous studies involving virtual stimuli have mostly focused on 2D simple shapes or lines [10, 13, 17, 19]. There are not many studies that investigate how the properties of 3D virtual objects interact with color and luminance to affect depth perception, especially in applications of augmented and mixed reality. Furthermore, studies using virtual 3D objects have typically evaluated a single 3D object [3, 47] and have not investigated the effects of object shape and fidelity on depth perception. In this paper, we investigate the effects of object shape, fidelity, color, and luminance on depth perception of 3D objects in handheld mobile AR. Mobile handheld AR has become popular due to the ubiquitous nature of smartphones [45]. Advances in mobile technology and affordability have allowe d mobile AR to become increasingly common in a variety of fields [7, 40].
