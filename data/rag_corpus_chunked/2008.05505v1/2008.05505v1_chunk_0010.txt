[13] proposed that the luminance contrast of an object against the scene is a principal pictorial cue, even when there are other depth cues in the scene , such as occlusion and interposition . Objects with a higher luminance contrast were more likely to be selected as near , regardless of other depth cues [13]. Guibal and Dresp [19] later found that color is not an independent depth cue and is strongly influenced by luminance contrast and stimulus geometry. Fujimara and Morishita [17] explored the combination of saturation and brightness as depth cues and found that the combination of the two cues was a stronger depth cue than brightness or saturation alone [17]. Although these studies provide evidence that depth cues can have interactions, they are only focused on 2D simple stimuli, such as shapes and lines, whereas we focus on 3D objects. The work of Bailey et al. [3] is among the most relevant for our experiment. They studied the effect of color on depth perception of a realistic 3D object in comparison to a traditional stimulus of a 2D simple shape. It was found that warm colors appeared closer than cool colors for the 2D simple shape, but this effect was not strong for the realistic 3D object. The colors tested in the experiment were of equal luminance with low saturation. Bailey et al. [3] provided compelling evidence that model dimension or shape may interact with color as a depth cue, but only studied one 3D model, while we investigate the properties of multiple 3D models. Investigating color and luminance as depth cues in AR has received interest in recent years. Singh et al. [47] examined brightness of a virtual object as a depth cue in AR using a custom- built AR haploscope . They found that the
