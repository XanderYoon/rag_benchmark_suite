never compared to itself. Σ can then be used to calculate a coefficient of agreement among participants as defined by Kendall and Babington [48]: u = 2Σ (𝑠 2)(𝑛 2) − 1 (2) Suppose that 𝑛 denotes the number of colors, while 𝑠 denotes the number of participants. If all participants made identical choices, then 𝑢 would be equal to 1. 𝑢 decreases as participants disagree, tending to −1/(𝑠 − 1) if 𝑠 is even and −1/𝑠 if 𝑠 is odd. The coefficient of agreement 𝑢 can tell us how much the participants agree with one another . We can test the significance of 𝑢 to determine if participants actually agree with one another using a large sample approximation to the sampling distribution [46]: χ2 = 𝑛(𝑛 − 1)(1 + 𝑢(𝑠 − 1)) 2 (3) χ2 is asymptotically distributed with 𝑛(𝑛 − 1)/2 degrees of freedom. We can use a table of probability value for χ2 , for example Table C in [46]. Using this statistic, we can test the null hypothesis 𝐻0 that there is no agreement among participants, which implies that all colors are perceptually equivalent. 3.5.2 Coefficient of Consistency Paired comparison experiments often measure the consistency, or transitivity, of a participant’s choices. For example, if a participant selects that 𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑜𝑟𝐴 is closer than 𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑜𝑟𝐵 and that 𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑜𝑟𝐵 is closer than 𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑜𝑟𝐶, then they should also select that 𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑜𝑟𝐴 is closer than 𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑜𝑟𝐶. If they select otherwise , then they would have created a circular triad. Inconsistency can frequently occur when the items being compared are similar and it is difficult to make judgments. We calculated a coefficient of consistency ζ as defined by Kendall and Babington [48] for even 𝑛, where 𝑐 denotes the number of circular triads: ζ = 1 − 24c n3 − 4𝑛 (4)
