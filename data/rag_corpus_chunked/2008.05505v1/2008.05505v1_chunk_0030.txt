AND FUTURE WORK In this paper, we presented a comparison of the effects of object shape, fidelity, color, and luminance on depth perception of 3D objects in handheld mobile AR. To determine these effects, we conducted a paired comparison experiment. The results of ou r study indicates that the shape and fidelity of 3D virtual objects interact with color and luminance to affect depth perception in handheld mobile AR. Increased fidelity increased perceptual differences among the color and luminance conditions for both shapes, and the simple high -fidelity object was more affected by color and luminance than either of the complex objects. In the future, we plan to investigate the effects of object shape, fidelity, color, and luminance in a more ecologically valid application context. It would be important to note if these effects are present in a mobile AR application that requires a task, such as an assembly or training task. Depth perception of objects can be extremely important in many AR applications, and it could be advantageous to developers to understand the effects of depth cues on 3D objects.
