luminance . We expect that warm bright colors will be perceived as nearer than cool bright colors, while warm dark colors will be perceived as nearer than cool dark colors. Previous studies propose that luminance is a stronger depth cue than co lor [35, 38], so we expect that this phenomenon will only occur at the same luminance level. RQ4: How does the luminance of a 3D model affect its perceived depth? H4 (Luminance): Brighter colors will be perceived as nearer than darker colors, regardless of shape, fidelity, and color hue. We expect that brighter colors will be perceived as nearer than dark colors, as they have more contrast with the background color. 3.5 Statistical Analysis We employed the same methodology and analysis methods as Ledda et al. [27], who provided compelling reasons to use the following methods of analysis in a paired comparison experiment. 3.5.1 Kendall Coefficient of Agreement If all participants vote the same way , then there is complete agreement. However, this is rarely the case, and it is important to determine if there is actual agreement between participants. Kendall’s coefficient of agreement utilizes the number of agreements between pairs. Σ = ∑ (pij 2 )i≠j (1) In Equation 1, suppose that 𝑝𝑖𝑗 is the number of times that 𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑜𝑟𝑖 is preferred to 𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑜𝑟𝑗 . Σ denotes the sum of the number of agreements in pairs, extending over all pairs excluding the diagonal because a color is never compared to itself. Σ can then be used to calculate a coefficient of agreement among participants as defined by Kendall and Babington [48]: u = 2Σ (𝑠 2)(𝑛 2) − 1 (2) Suppose that 𝑛 denotes the number of colors, while 𝑠 denotes the number of participants. If all participants made identical choices, then 𝑢 would be equal to
