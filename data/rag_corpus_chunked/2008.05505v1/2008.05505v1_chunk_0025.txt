outlined by Starks and David [49], at the α = 0.05 level. Table 5 shows the total number of groupings and largest number of distinct, non-overlapping groupings for each model . Note that the cube only has 1 grouping total as we cannot conclude that there is any difference in depth perception between color conditions. We evaluate d our hypotheses based on the total number of perceptual groupings, the largest number of distinct groupings, and pairs of stimuli that do not share a grouping. It is interesting to note that yellow was the only bright color that is consistently ranked lower than dark colors. No other bri ght color ranked below dark colors in terms of score. This is likely because the bright colors had a relatively low luminance due to luminance balancing, causing the yellow to appear more like brown. Bailey et al. [3] observed similar results in their study, where they used a n unsaturated yellow with relatively low luminance . Due to this reason, we will mostly exclude it from our discussion. Our results partially support H1 (Shape). We cannot conclude that the depth perception of the low -fidelity, simple shape (the cube) is affected by color and luminance. However, t he high - fidelity, simple shape ( the sphere) was the only model that demonstrated classical effects of color on depth perception . Red, the warmest color, is ranked as the closest color and is in a distinct group of its own. Red is perceived as significantly distinct from any other color, which was not the case for either bunny model. The perceived depth of the sphere is also more affected by luminance compared t o the complex bunny shapes. None of the bright colors are in a perceptually similar group ing as its darker counterpart.
