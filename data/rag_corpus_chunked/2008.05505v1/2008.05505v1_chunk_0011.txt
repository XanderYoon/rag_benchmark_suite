a depth cue, but only studied one 3D model, while we investigate the properties of multiple 3D models. Investigating color and luminance as depth cues in AR has received interest in recent years. Singh et al. [47] examined brightness of a virtual object as a depth cue in AR using a custom- built AR haploscope . They found that the brightness of a virtual object in AR has effects on depth perception and depth matching. This experiment provided useful insights on brightness as a depth cue for head-worn AR, but we are interested in handheld mobile AR. Kalia et al. [24] expressed motivation to improve depth perception in AR medical imaging applications . They combined color cues with depth of focus blur and found that using warm colors for close objects and cool colors for far objects improved perception. Although this study was motivated by AR applications, they did not use an AR apparatus and showed participants images or videos on a desktop monitor [24]. Castell et al. [6] investigated how the brightness of a ceiling in VR affect ed perception of the ceiling height and found that a brighter ceiling caused participants to perceive the ceiling as higher than a darker ceiling. Castell et al. [6] noted that this result followed traditional interior design theory , where brighter ceilings are perceived as higher than darker ceilings. This study focused on the brightness of the interior space instead of a 3D object in the scene, which our study addresses. 3 HANDHELD MOBILE AR DEPTH PERCEPTION STUDY We conducted a paired comparison experiment to determine the effects of object shape, fidelity, color, and luminance on depth perception of 3D objects in handheld mobile AR. We expected simple shapes to be more affected by color and luminance than complex shapes and high-fidelity
