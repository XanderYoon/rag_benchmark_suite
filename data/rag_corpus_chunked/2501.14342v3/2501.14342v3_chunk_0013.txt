in Appendix Table 7. Our CoRAG-8B model achieves a new state-of-the-art performance across all tasks, with the exception of FEVER, where it marginally trails behind a larger model with 11B parameters. 4.3 Scaling Test-Time Compute In alignment with OpenAI o1 [12], our model allows for scaling test-time compute to potentially achieve better performance without updating model weights. There are multiple ways to control the test-time compute. In Figure 3, we concentrate on two factors: the retrieval chain length L and the number of sampled chains N for best-of-N sampling. Greedy decoding is a special instance of best-of-Nsampling withN= 1and the temperature set to0. 6 Table 2: The downstream results on thehidden test setof the KILT benchmark. All scores are sourced directly from the official leaderboard, with the exception that “RA-DIT 65B” is from the original paper [23]. ∗: “Previous Best” refers to the highest score for each task on the public KILT leaderboard as of January 10, 2025.
