Case AnalysisTable 11 presents several model predictions on the validation set of the HotpotQA dataset. We compare the performance of RAG without chain-of-retrieval against CoRAG. CoRAG effectively decompose the complex multi-hop queries into a sequences of simpler sub-queries and dynamically conducts query reformulation when the retrieved information proves unhelpful. In the fourth example, the model initially hallucinates some incorrect information but subsequently self-corrects by verifying the poet’s name and country of origin through additional retrieval steps. C Statistical Significance We compute the 95% confidence intervals for our main results in Table 1 and 2 using the bootstrap resampling method. On all datasets except the Bamboogle dataset, we observe that the performance of CoRAG-8B is significantly better than the baselines. D Prompts Table 10: Task descriptions for each dataset.
