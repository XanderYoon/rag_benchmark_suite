The improvements are particularly pronounced on more challenging datasets like MuSiQue and Bamboogle, where single-step retrieval struggles most. This indicates that CoRAG’s iterative query reformulation and decomposition strategy effectively addresses the limitations of traditional dense retrieval, enabling the model to gather more relevant information through multiple retrieval steps. 6 Conclusion In this work, we introduce CoRAG, a framework that teaches LLMs to conduct iterative retrieval and reasoning to answer complex queries. The intermediate retrieval chains are automatically generated via rejection sampling, thereby alleviating the need for manual annotation. At test time, we offer multiple decoding strategies to manage the trade-off between performance and compute. Our experiments demonstrate that CoRAG-8B achieves state-of-the-art performance on both multi- hop QA datasets and the KILT benchmark, surpassing many baselines built with larger LLMs. A comprehensive analysis is conducted to understand its scaling behavior and generalization capability. In the future, we intend to extend CoRAG to more challenging and economically valuable RAG tasks, advancing towards building factual and trustworthy AI systems. 7 Limitations and Broader Impacts This study primarily investigates RAG tasks characterized by short and easy-to-verify answers, such as multi-hop QA and entity linking. However, real-world applications often necessitate addressing more complex tasks
