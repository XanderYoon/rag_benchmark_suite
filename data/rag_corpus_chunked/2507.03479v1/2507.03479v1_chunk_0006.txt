real- world data for XIR research. This makes it challenging to design and evaluate explainable retrieval systems using realistic datasets. Releasing such data for reproducibility is equally difficult and may be only possible in anonymised form. Therefore, it is crucial to en- sure that anonymised datasets still retain enough fidelity to reflect real-world scenarios. For example, anonymised employee expense reports – preserving categories like travel, meals, or lodging, along with approval status and justifications – can be used to simulate retrieval tasks, such as finding similar past expenses. 3.3 Ground Truth Explanations As emphasised in Section 2.2, designing helpful explanations is an important research direction in this domain. A major challenge lies in providing appropriate ground truth explanations for evalu- ation [36, 38, 40, 42]. Research in XAI has shown that the quality of explanations is context-dependent [21] and that different user groups might prefer different explanation modalities [14]. For exam- ple, a junior auditor might need detailed textual evidence pointing to inconsistencies in SAP exports, while a manager might prefer a visual overview linking anomalies across reports. These varying needs, combined with the opacity of existing systems, highlight the importance of developing and evaluating multi-modal, post-hoc explanation methods tailored to audit tasks.
