a chain of events, or links to supporting documents. Future research needs to investigate in detail the type of information needs that can occur and how these are best supported through appropriate explanations. 2.2 Explanations in Audit-Related IR Once information needs are understood, the next step is to design explanations that effectively support them. Prior work has explored various explanation formats, including visualisations [ 1, 34], de- tailed descriptions [34, 46] (e.g., knowledge graphs showing rela- tionships between relevant documents) and textual highlights (e.g., key sentences in relevant documents) [ 33]. In the audit context, the preferred explanation format may vary depending on the task. For example, when verifying an expense claim, auditors might pre- fer a short textual summary linking the claim to relevant policy documents and approval records. In contrast, when investigating a complex revenue recognition issue, a visual explanation showing dependencies across contracts, revenue entries, and timeline events could be more useful. Understanding these preferences is key to building IR systems that enhance auditor efficiency and trust. 2.3 Representing Audit-Related Knowledge From a system perspective, knowledge representation plays a cen- tral role in supporting explainability. Research suggests that knowl- edge graphs are well-suited for this, as their structure inherently conveys relationships between entities [6, 9, 25]. In the audit do- main, many elements are interdependent. For instance, a revenue entry in the general ledger might depend on multiple underlying sales contracts, which in turn relate to delivery records and ap- proval workflows. Representing these relationships in a knowledge graph allows for intuitive navigation and explanation – for example, showing how a revenue figure is supported by a chain of contractual and operational evidence. 3 CHALLENGES In this section, we highlight the challenges of conducting XIR re- search in the audit domain, which relate to gathering realistic in-
