This undermines trust, particularly in high-stakes domains such as medicine and finance. Explainable information retrieval (XIR) aims to address this by making search re- sults more transparent and interpretable. While most XIR research is domain-agnostic, this paper focuses on auditing – a critical yet underexplored area. We argue that XIR systems can support audi- tors in completing their complex task. We outline key challenges and future research directions to advance XIR in this domain. KEYWORDS explainable IR, audit, information needs 1 INTRODUCTION Recently, agents like Microsoft Copilot and Google Gemini have gained popularity by combining the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with search systems to support users in completing complex search tasks [ 41, 48]. To promote trust, these systems often include references to the sources their answers are based on [48]. However, these references are frequently fabricated or misleading [45], which undermines the trustworthiness of such agents [4, 50, 53]. This issue becomes particularly critical in high- stakes domains such as medicine [ 13] and business [ 55], where decisions based on inaccurate or misleading information can have serious consequences. For instance, if doctors rely on incorrect agent responses to epilepsy [27] or cancer-related [37] queries, they may make harmful treatment decisions [22]. Similarly, businesses that base their strategies on misleading information risk significant financial losses [12]. Therefore, building trust in these systems is essential. To this
