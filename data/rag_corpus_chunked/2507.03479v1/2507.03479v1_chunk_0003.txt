the relevance of key financial documents and tables in their investigations. To advance research in this domain, we propose future research directions (see Section 2) and outline key challenges in XIR research for the audit context (see Section 3). 2 RESEARCH DIRECTIONS In this section, we outline key research directions to advance re- search on XIR in the audit domain. These include understanding auditor information needs (see Section 2.1), designing suitable expla- nations (see Section 2.2), and developing interpretable knowledge representations (see Section 2.3). Frummet et al. 2.1 Information Needs in the Audit Domain Understanding user information needs is a critical first step in designing effective information retrieval (IR) systems, as it influ- ences how search systems should be structured [ 19, 26, 49]. For instance, Frummet and Elsweiler [15] found that users in the cook- ing domain tend to prefer concise answers to simple, fact-based questions (e.g., “How much sugar do I need?”) and more detailed responses for complex, competence-oriented queries (e.g., “How do I chop an onion?”). Similarly, the audit domain likely involves a broad spectrum of information needs. It seems plausible that information needs in this domain could range from simple fact- checking (e.g., “What was the invoice amount for transaction X?”) to complex procedural or investigative queries (e.g., “How was this cost justified and approved across departments?”). The nature of the information need can influence how explanations should be presented – whether as a direct answer, a chain of events, or links to supporting documents. Future research needs to investigate in detail the type of information needs that can occur and how these are best supported through appropriate explanations. 2.2 Explanations in Audit-Related IR Once information needs are understood, the next step is to design explanations that effectively support them. Prior work has explored various explanation
