the purpose of a Neurosymbolic system is to continuously process each utterance, extract symbolic features that build a progressive, rich clinical picture for proper assessment. Traditional closed box retrieval systems struggle with natural conversations because they lack the structured knowledge to integrate information across multiple turns and understand causal relationships between disclosed facts. A standard neural system might retrieve depression articles when the patient mentions low mood, then separately retrieve trauma articles when abuse is mentioned, and sleep articles when insomnia comes up, but it wouldn’t understand that these form a coherent clinical pattern requiring integrated assessment and treatment. The neurosymbolic modulation approach succeeds because the symbolic knowledge structures explicitly encode these relationships: ACE exposure→increases risk for→Sleep Disorder→ maintains→Depression→requires→Trauma-informed Treatment. ACE: Adverse Childhood Experiences. The neural component provides flexible pattern matching across diverse ways patients describe experiences (”brain won’t shut off” = hyperarousal; ”nothing seems fun” = anhe- donia), while the symbolic component ensures these patterns are interpreted within established clinical questionnaires. Traditional closed box Retrieval at turntoperates inde- pendently for each utterance. The scoring function can be expressed as: score(queryt,doc) = cosine(e t q, ed) Each utterance is processed independently. If the patient mentions depression at turn 1, trauma at turn 2, and sleep prob- lems at turn 3, the system performs three separate retrievals with no connection between them. Neurosymbolic Retrieval with Accumulation:Neurosymbolic retrieval addresses this limitation through feature accumulation across conversation turns. The accumulation process builds a progressively richer representation of the clinical picture as the conversation unfolds. At each turn t, the system maintains an accumulated set of symbolic featuresφ(t)that combines all previously extracted features with newly identified ones. This accumulation is formally expressed as: φ(t) =φ(t−1)∪φ new(t) e′ q t =e t q +α t ·W q ·φ(t) Here,φ(t)accumulates symbolic features across turns, building a
