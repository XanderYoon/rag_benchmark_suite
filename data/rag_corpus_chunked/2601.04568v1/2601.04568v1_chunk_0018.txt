It also leads to clinical relevance, reflecting its ability to follow established diagnostic workflows. KG-Path RAG performs similarly well, supported by its knowledge graph grounding, which helps maintain clear, meaningful reasoning. MentalLLAMA-33B performs adequately but shows lower interpretability and clini- cal alignment. Proknow-RAG is also the most computationally efficient, making it the most practical and reliable option for real clinical decision-support scenarios. CONCLUSION ANDFUTUREDIRECTIONS This work demonstrates that neurosymbolic approaches can fundamentally reshape how clinical retrieval systems reason over multi-turn patient narratives. By embedding structured clinical knowledge directly into the retrieval process, these architectures move beyond surface-level pattern matching and instead support decisions that can be justified, interrogated, and aligned with clinical logic. The result is a retrieval paradigm in which system behavior is no longer a byproduct of opaque embedding geometries, but the
