uses LLM-generated knowledge graphs to extract entity relation- ships and create community summaries, enabling hierarchical reasoning that substantially outperforms baseline RAG on global queries requiring dataset-wide understanding. While RuleRAG [5], and GraphRAG [6], enhance RAG through symbolic reasoning and knowledge graphs, they differ fundamentally from MAR, KG-Path RAG, and Proknow- RAG in both architectural integration and interpretability mechanisms. RuleRAG and GraphRAG augment retrieval with external symbolic structures but maintain decoupling between symbolic reasoning and neural retrieval. GraphRAG uses KGs primarily for query enrichment and post-retrieval organization, while the actual retrieval remains in vector space. KG-Path RAG addresses this limitation through joint optimization, treating KG traversal and retrieval as a unified process where graph-based ranking losses (analogous to PageRank) itera- tively refine retrieval distributions, achieving query enrichment more efficiently while providing explicit path-based prove- nance. MAR differs further by making embeddings themselves interpretable through modulation networks that project sym- bolic features directly into the neural representation. Finally, while these approaches improve semantic grounding and log- ical consistency, Proknow-RAG uniquely enforces procedu- ral correctness by leveraging domain-specific instruments to reorder evidence according to validated clinical workflows, ensuring not just relevance but adherence to established as- sessment sequences critical in high-stakes domains. KNOWLEDGEMODULATION-ALIGNEDRETRIEVAL Traditional Dense Passage Retrieval encodes queries and documents into opaque vector spaces where we don’t under- stand why certain documents match certain queries—we only see that their cosine similarity is high. Instead of directly using raw neural embeddings, we introduce modulation networks that adjust embeddings based on interpretable, domain-specific factors. The query path processes text through a base encoder followed by a modulation network to produce a modulated embedding, while the document path follows an identical structure. The modulation networks decompose the embedding space into interpretable dimensions that can be visualized, explained, and controlled. Think of it as adding ”semantic
