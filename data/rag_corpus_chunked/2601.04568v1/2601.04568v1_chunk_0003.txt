domain-appropriate reasoning steps. These elements transform retrieval from an opaque similarity search into an accountable, workflow-aligned reasoning process. By unifying neural flexibility with symbolic structure, neurosymbolic RAG offers a path toward verifiable, interpretable systems capable of meeting the demands of safety-critical domains. This work introduces Neurosymbolic RAG, a framework that tightly couples symbolic reasoning with neural retrieval to address three fundamental research questions that challenge the closed box paradigm: RQ1:Can retrievers be made interpretable through sym- bolic feature accumulation? Traditional dense retrievers en- code queries and documents into opaque embedding spaces, providing no insight into matching criteria. Wetheoretically investigate whether retrieval can be augmented with sym- bolic features—accumulated across conversational context, that explicitly modulate embeddings to provide transparent justifications for document (or chunk) selection.(Section 2) RQ2:Can knowledge graphs simultaneously improve and explain retrieval? Structured knowledge offers both semantic enrichment and interpretable reasoning paths. We examine whether integrating knowledge graphs with neural retrieval via query enrichment and graph-based ranking can reveal the logical chains connecting queries to evidence while improving retrieval quality via semantically informed traversal paths. (Section 3) RQ3:Can procedural knowledge guide retrieval to follow domain-specific workflows? Beyond semantic relevance, many domains require adherence to validated assessment protocols. We explore whether incorporating structured procedural instru- ments—such as clinical questionnaires—can reorder retrieved evidence to follow the same stepwise reasoning processes used by domain experts. (Section 4) RELATEDWORK Recently, there have been significant efforts into neurosym- bolic retrieval-augmented generation, such as ArgRAG and SymRAG [3], [4]. ArgRAG introduces a training-free neu- rosymbolic framework that combines RAG with Quantita- tive Bipolar Argumentation Framework (QBAF) for robust, explainable, and contestable fact verification and scientific feasibility, modeling support and attack relations between claims and retrieved evidence to compute final argument strengths. SymRAG presents a neuro-symbolic framework that introduces adaptive query routing based on real-time com-
