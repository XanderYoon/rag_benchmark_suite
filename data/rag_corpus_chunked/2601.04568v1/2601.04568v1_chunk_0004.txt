and SymRAG [3], [4]. ArgRAG introduces a training-free neu- rosymbolic framework that combines RAG with Quantita- tive Bipolar Argumentation Framework (QBAF) for robust, explainable, and contestable fact verification and scientific feasibility, modeling support and attack relations between claims and retrieved evidence to compute final argument strengths. SymRAG presents a neuro-symbolic framework that introduces adaptive query routing based on real-time com- plexity and system load assessments, dynamically selecting symbolic, neural, or hybrid processing paths to align resource use with query demands while achieving high accuracy with significantly lower CPU utilization. However, these approaches primarily address post-hoc ex- plainability through argumentation frameworks or computa- tional efficiency through adaptive routing, but do not funda- mentally transform the retrieval process itself to be inherently interpretable from the ground up. Furthermore, while ArgRAG provides faithful explanations for fact verification tasks, it treats each retrieved document chunk as a single argument without considering fine-grained argument extraction or the sequential ordering requirements imposed by domain-specific procedural workflows. Similarly, SymRAG optimizes resource allocation across query types but lacks mechanisms to enforce adherence to validated assessment protocols or established reasoning sequences that are critical in high-stakes domains such as clinical decision-support, where correct procedural ordering (e.g., screening before diagnosis, risk assessment before intervention) is essential for safe and effective care. RuleRAG introduces symbolic rules as demonstrations for in-context learning to guide retrievers toward logically re- lated documents and generators toward rule-attributed answers, achieving 89.2% improvement in Recall@10 . GraphRAG uses LLM-generated knowledge graphs to extract entity relation- ships and create community summaries, enabling hierarchical reasoning that substantially outperforms baseline RAG on global queries requiring dataset-wide understanding. While RuleRAG [5], and GraphRAG [6], enhance RAG through symbolic reasoning and knowledge graphs, they differ fundamentally from MAR, KG-Path RAG, and Proknow- RAG in both architectural integration and interpretability mechanisms.
