The hyperparametersγis set to 0.15 andβis set to 0.40 to achieve results shown in Table I. 5. Final Retrieval:: Retrieved=top-k{d j :score(q enriched, dj)} Figure 1 describes the process of training interpretable and traceable retrievers using a graph-based ranking loss and illustrates how the KG is traversed during retriever training, along with the resultant “path” that can be used for reasoning behind the retrieval and the downstream-generated answers. PROCESSKNOWLEDGE-INFUSEDRAG (PROKNOW-RAG) While logical coherence and semantic relatedness, enforced via a knowledge graph and appropriate scoring models, help ensure that retrieved documents are locally consistent and topically aligned, they do not by themselves guarantee that the resulting document sequence adheres to an external, domain- specific process. In many domains, such as mental health, there exist well-established procedural instruments, e.g., the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression [9] and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) for anxiety [10]—that encode an implicit reasoning and assessment work- flow followed by clinicians. In KG-Path RAG, these ques- tionnaires can be treated as structured procedural knowledge, providing an external template to order retrieved passages so that the information is presented in the same stepwise fashion as a clinician’s assessment. This is analogous, at a domain level, to how ReAct-style prompting [11] and how process reward models in the LLM literature [12] supervise and reward the quality of the reasoning process rather than only the final answer; here, the questionnaire defines a
