users cannot verify which passages shaped the model’s answer; and domain specialists cannot confirm adherence to established workflows. Conse- quently, RAG’s nominal transparency by providing sources fails to guarantee trustworthy reasoning. In a clinical-decision-support context, a system might re- trieve and present appropriate clinical guidelines, yet still fail by violating the correct sequence of care. For instance, first, a screening tool flags a potential concern; next, a clinical consultation obtains more context; then, a risk assessment identifies high-risk patients; followed by a diagnostic interview to apply formal criteria; and finally, the patient receives a guided intervention such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). If the system presents these steps out of order (e.g., recommending CBT before assessing risk or diagnosis), the result appears evidence-based yet mis-implements the work- flow. Research supports such stepped workflows: systematic screening tools should trigger deeper assessment when needed. In turn, the formal diagnostic interview and treatment planning follow assessment and risk stratification. Thus, while accessing guideline content (retrieval) is necessary, it is not sufficient: correct ordering, branching, and contextual logic remain crit- ical to effective, safe care [2]. Addressing this opacity requires a shift from post hoc explanation to inherently interpretable architectures. Neu- rosymbolic integration provides such a foundation by em- bedding structured symbolic representations directly into the arXiv:2601.04568v1 [cs.AI] 8 Jan 2026 retrieval pipeline. Knowledge graphs can reveal explicit se- mantic traversal paths, symbolic features can transparently modulate neural embeddings, and procedural instruments can enforce domain-appropriate reasoning steps. These elements transform retrieval from an opaque similarity search into an accountable, workflow-aligned reasoning process. By unifying neural flexibility with symbolic structure, neurosymbolic RAG offers a path toward verifiable, interpretable systems capable of meeting the demands of safety-critical domains. This work introduces Neurosymbolic RAG, a framework that tightly couples symbolic reasoning with neural retrieval to address three
