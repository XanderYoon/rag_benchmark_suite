order retrieved passages so that the information is presented in the same stepwise fashion as a clinician’s assessment. This is analogous, at a domain level, to how ReAct-style prompting [11] and how process reward models in the LLM literature [12] supervise and reward the quality of the reasoning process rather than only the final answer; here, the questionnaire defines a human- designed reasoning process, and retrieval is guided to follow that process in a clinically meaningful order. Methodologically, we characterize this as process- knowledge–infused RAG, since the approach operates at the intersection of KG-guided retrieval and the subsequent procedural reordering of passages based on domain-specific process knowledge encoded in the clinical questionnaire [13]. In this formulation, the knowledge graph provides semantic and logical coherence, while the questionnaire acts as an external procedural scaffold that constrains the ordering of evidence, enabling the retrieval pipeline to follow the same stepwise assessment process used by domain experts. Imagine a scenario, the AI assistant is conducting a mental- health follow-up session. As the person speaks, the assistant identifies important clinical terms, such as symptoms or emo- tional states, using a mental-health knowledge graph, which organizes how symptoms, conditions, and questionnaires relate to each other [14]. The system then retrieves the person’s past information and asks focused follow-up questions like, “You previously reported X. Are you still experiencing it?” This step depends on accurate retrieval of the user’s history and relevant clinical concepts, which is handled by the KG-Path RAG’s retrieval framework. When a symptom is confirmed or a new one is reported, the assistant uses the knowledge graph to determine which standardized questionnaires apply (e.g., PHQ-9 for depression or GAD-7 for anxiety). Selecting the right questionnaire is a retrieval problem, because the system must match user- reported symptoms to the appropriate assessment tool. The
