complexity grows. Third, es- tablishing clinician-centered evaluation frameworks will be critical. Retrieval outputs must be assessed not merely for correctness, but also for their appropriateness within pro- fessional practice, consistency with diagnostic guidance, and safety within high-stakes decision contexts. Ultimately, the central question is whether neurosymbolic systems can meet the rigor demanded of tools intended for clinical workflows: grounding (relates to reliability), transparency, and the capacity to justify their recommendations in terms that clinicians can trust. The architectures introduced here represent an important step toward that goal, illustrating how symbolic structure and neural flexibility can be combined to support retrieval that is not only accurate but meaningfully aligned with clinical reasoning.
