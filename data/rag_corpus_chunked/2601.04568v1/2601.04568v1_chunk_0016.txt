handled by the KG-Path RAG’s retrieval framework. When a symptom is confirmed or a new one is reported, the assistant uses the knowledge graph to determine which standardized questionnaires apply (e.g., PHQ-9 for depression or GAD-7 for anxiety). Selecting the right questionnaire is a retrieval problem, because the system must match user- reported symptoms to the appropriate assessment tool. The knowledge graph ensures this matching is clinically valid. After selecting the questionnaire, the system uses its struc- tured items to determine the order of the questions it asks. This keeps the conversation aligned with the clinical workflow followed by human practitioners. Organizing information and questions in this structured way is supported by KG-Path RAG, which helps the system follow meaningful paths in the knowledge graph and maintain a coherent sequence during retrieval and questioning. Across the full benchmark, KG-Path RAG and Proknow- RAG consistently deliver stronger, more clinically aligned performance than MentalLLAMA-33B (refer table I). KG- Path RAG excels in tasks that depend on precise symptom interpretation. It achieves the best results in Depression Detec- tion (84.7%) and shows strong performance in Stress Analysis (81.2%). These gains stem from its knowledge-graph–guided retrieval, which helps the system understand how symptoms cluster, relate, and differentiate across conditions. This deeper semantic grounding allows KG-Path RAG to retrieve more clinically relevant evidence than a pure language-model ap- proach. Proknow-RAG shines when the task requires struc- tured clinical reasoning. It delivers the highest score in Suicide Risk Detection (89.1%) and remains strong in Self-harm Risk Detection (83.2%). The questionnaire-based process layer enforces a validated clinical workflow, guiding the model to ask the right questions in the right order. This produces safer and more reliable assessments, especially in high-risk cate- gories where procedural structure matters. MentalLLAMA- 33B performs well in Anxiety Detection (79.8%) and offers balanced
