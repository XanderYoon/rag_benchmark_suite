Suicide Risk Detection (89.1%) and remains strong in Self-harm Risk Detection (83.2%). The questionnaire-based process layer enforces a validated clinical workflow, guiding the model to ask the right questions in the right order. This produces safer and more reliable assessments, especially in high-risk cate- gories where procedural structure matters. MentalLLAMA- 33B performs well in Anxiety Detection (79.8%) and offers balanced results overall, with strong explanation-generation ability. However, it lacks the semantic scaffolding of KG-Path RAG and the procedural reasoning of Proknow-RAG, limiting its diagnostic precision in complex or high-risk assessments.

Human evaluation comparing KG-Path RAG, Proknow-RAG, and MentalLLAMA-33B on mental health detection tasks sourced from the IMHI dataset[15]. Three attributes were measured: Interpretability (Interp.), Clinical Relevance (Clinic. Rel.), and Computational Efficiency (Comp. Eff.).Inter- pretabilityassesses whether retrieved chunks provide transparent reasoning for answer generation.Clinical Relevanceevaluates the presence and accuracy of clinical entities in retrieved chunks that align with the input query. Computational Efficiencymeasures the time required to generate complete responses.
