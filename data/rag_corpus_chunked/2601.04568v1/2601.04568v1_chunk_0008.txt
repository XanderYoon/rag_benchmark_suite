progressively richer representation of the clinical picture as the conversation unfolds. At each turn t, the system maintains an accumulated set of symbolic featuresφ(t)that combines all previously extracted features with newly identified ones. This accumulation is formally expressed as: φ(t) =φ(t−1)∪φ new(t) e′ q t =e t q +α t ·W q ·φ(t) Here,φ(t)accumulates symbolic features across turns, building a comprehensive clinical picture. At turn 1 (t= 1), when the patient states “I’ve been feeling really down lately,” the system extracts the symbolic feature{depressed mood}, soφ(1) ={depressed mood}. At turn 2 (t= 2), the patient mentions “Nothing seems fun anymore,” leading to the extraction of new featuresφ new(2) ={anhedonia}. The accu- mulated feature set now becomesφ(2) =φ(1)∪φ new(2) = {depressed mood,anhedonia}. By turn 3 (t= 3), when the patient discloses “I can’t sleep. I lie awake thinking about my dad’s temper when I was a kid,” the system extracts φnew(3) ={chronic insomnia,rumination,ACE disclosure, childhood abuse}. The complete accumulated feature set be- comesφ(3) ={depressed mood,anhedonia, chronic insomnia,rumination,ACE disclosure, childhood abuse}. The modulation strengthα t is computed dynamically based on clinical complexity. As the feature set grows and reveals more interconnected symptoms, the system increases reliance on structured clinical knowledge. The modulation strength is determined through a sigmoid function: αt =σ(k·complexity(φ(t))) Whereσis the sigmoid function, andkcontrols sensitivity. The complexity metric itself is computed from three compo- nents that capture different aspects of the clinical presentation: complexity(φ(t)) =|φ(t)|+ X i,j∈φ(t) wij + X i∈φ(t) ri The first term|φ(t)|represents the symptom count— the total number of distinct clinical features identified in a patient-clinician conversation. The second term captures graph connectivity, summing the connection weightsw ij between featuresiandjwithin the clinical knowledge graph. The third term incorporates risk weighting, summing the clinical severity scoresr i for each feature. Together, these components provide a nuanced measure of
