i∈φ(t) ri The first term|φ(t)|represents the symptom count— the total number of distinct clinical features identified in a patient-clinician conversation. The second term captures graph connectivity, summing the connection weightsw ij between featuresiandjwithin the clinical knowledge graph. The third term incorporates risk weighting, summing the clinical severity scoresr i for each feature. Together, these components provide a nuanced measure of how complex and interconnected the clinical presentation has become. The modulated query embeddinge ′ q(t)is generated by shift- ing the base neural embeddinge q(t)through the modulation termW q ·φ(t), which projects the accumulated symbolic features into the embedding space. The projection matrixW q has been learned during training to map each symbolic clinical concept to an appropriate direction in the high-dimensional embedding space. Documents in the database are similarly modulated based on their extracted symbolic featuresφ d. The document modulation follows the same principle: e′ d =e d +β·W d ·φ d For example, consider a document titled “Integrated Assess- ment for Trauma-Related Depression” that has been annotated with symbolic featuresφ d ={trauma protocol, sleep assess- ment, Major Depressive Disorder criteria, ACE screening}. This document’s embedding is pre-computed and modulated using these features, positioning it in the embedding space where queries with similar feature combinations will find it through high cosine similarity. The retrieval score between a query at turntand a candidate document is computed as the cosine similarity between their modulated embeddings: score(queryt,doc) =cosine(e ′ q t, e′ d) Finally, the system ranks all documents in the database according to their scores and retrieves the top-kmost rele- vant documents. This ranking can be expressed as retrieving the set of documents with the highest scores: Retrieved= top-k{doci :score(query t,doc i)}. Through this neurosym- bolic approach, the system successfully identifies that the patient’s disclosure across three turns represents an integrated clinical
