clinical retrieval systems reason over multi-turn patient narratives. By embedding structured clinical knowledge directly into the retrieval process, these architectures move beyond surface-level pattern matching and instead support decisions that can be justified, interrogated, and aligned with clinical logic. The result is a retrieval paradigm in which system behavior is no longer a byproduct of opaque embedding geometries, but the consequence of explicit clinical constructs that remain visible throughout the reasoning pipeline. Across the designs explored, a consistent theme emerges: neurosymbolic systems provide a means to preserve the linguistic adaptability of neural models while grounding their behavior in the normative structure of clinical assessment. This hybridization is particularly important for conversations involving trauma, multi-symptom presentations, or evolving disclosure patterns. In these settings, retrieval quality is not defined solely by relevance, but by whether the system recognizes the clinical relationships implicit in the patient’s unfolding story. The architectures presented here show how symbolic structure can anchor that process, ensuring that patient narratives are interpreted cohesively rather than as isolated fragments. Looking forward, several research directions are essential for advancing neurosymbolic retrieval toward real clinical deployment. First, systematic evaluation of transparency, evi- dentiary traceability, and alignment with clinical reasoning is required—especially in comparison to emerging agentic and closed box retrieval methods that lack explicit auditability. Second, expanding these systems to operate over multimodal sources, such as neuroimaging, physiological monitoring, or longitudinal patient records, raises the challenge of main- taining interpretability as data complexity grows. Third, es- tablishing clinician-centered evaluation frameworks will be critical. Retrieval outputs must be assessed not merely for correctness, but also for their appropriateness within pro- fessional practice, consistency with diagnostic guidance, and safety within high-stakes decision contexts. Ultimately, the central question is whether neurosymbolic systems can meet the rigor demanded of tools intended for clinical workflows: grounding (relates
