Finally, the system ranks all documents in the database according to their scores and retrieves the top-kmost rele- vant documents. This ranking can be expressed as retrieving the set of documents with the highest scores: Retrieved= top-k{doci :score(query t,doc i)}. Through this neurosym- bolic approach, the system successfully identifies that the patient’s disclosure across three turns represents an integrated clinical syndrome requiring comprehensive trauma-informed assessment, rather than three separate issues to be addressed independently. KG-PATHRAG Standard vector-based RAG architectures typically do not propagate explicit retrieval-path information (e.g., document lineage or multi-hop transitions), which limits the interpretabil- ity and fine-grained traceability of retrieval decisions. Methods such as GraphRAG mitigate this limitation by inducing a knowledge graph over the corpus—where nodes represent entities or text units and edges encode semantic relation- ships—and then performing path-aware retrieval over this structure, yielding more coherent and interpretable evidence chains for complex queries [6]. However, much of the re- cent work on provenance and traceability in RAG, such as citation-highlighting and interactive visual evaluation tools like RAGTrace, has primarily focused on analyzing and visual- izing retrieval behavior [7], rather than on architectures that incorporate knowledge-graph structures to iteratively enrich user queries and enhance ranking quality via graph-aware retrieval. In parallel, knowledge-graph-enhanced RAG and query-refinement methods have emerged as separate lines of work, aiming to leverage structured graphs or iterative query rewriting to improve retrieval quality and ranking, yet there remains relatively little research that tightly integrates these directions into a single, knowledge-graph–infused, path-aware RAG framework that both enriches queries and optimizes document ranking using explicit provenance signals. One line of work that attempts to address the lack of query-aware graph optimization in GraphRAG is G-Retriever [8], which conditions retrieval on subgraphs extracted through prize- collecting Steiner tree (PCST) optimization. This approach can yield more precise query-specific
