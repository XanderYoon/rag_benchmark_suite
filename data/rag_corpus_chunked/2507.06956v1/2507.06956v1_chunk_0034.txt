minimum performing cases, respectively. (T%X: Typo insertion at %X level) while the average retriever results displayed on Fig- ure 4 and 9 are reported in Table 4. A.6 RAG Robustness In this section of the Appendix we report the results of the experiments and results of the analysis we perform to understand the importance of param- eter "k" selection and the impact of the different perturbations on different Top@K levels. Figure 7: Effect of Top@k choice on RAG performance under different perturbations. Top-k Effect: To understand the effect of the perturbations better, we also investigated their re- lationship increasing k parameter. Increasing the number of documents, i.e. k, increases the like- lihood of retrieving the related text passage and returning it within the retrieved set "Top-k", how- ever, the increase in this parameter also increases the proportion of the irrelevant documents that are returned. This is due to limited number of exist- ing relevant documents defined per query in the system. When combined with different perturba- tion types, each perturbation results in different trends as shown in Figure 7 with the unigram token overlap F1 used as the metric. The end-to-end RAG performances for all gener- ators and perturbation combinations on HotpotQA dataset, where BGE Base is used as the retriever, can be seen in Figure 9 for the k values of 1, 5, and 10. Recall Precision Figure 8: Remaining retriever performances with Recall@k and Precision@5 metrics on all datasets with respect to changing Top@k values.
