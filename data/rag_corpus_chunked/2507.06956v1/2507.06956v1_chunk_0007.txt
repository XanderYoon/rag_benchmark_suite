non-perturbed sample is shown below.

This can be done by, for example, inserting words such as "might" into the formula- tions of the sentences or changing words to more general correspondents (e.g., changing "rapper" to "artist"). "When might the Cannes Film Festival be held?" 3.2 Typo Perturbations It is also common for users to make minor spelling mistakes, especially when typing quickly. In many cases, these errors do not impede human comprehension-for example, typing “tomrow” in- stead of “tomorrow”. Nevertheless, such typo- graphical errors may still affect retrieval and gener- ation in a token-based RAG pipeline. One potential solution is to run a dedicated spell checker before feeding the text into the RAG pipeline, but this introduces additional computational overhead and may be inaccurate for domain-specific terminology. For instance, the term “agentic,” recently popular-
