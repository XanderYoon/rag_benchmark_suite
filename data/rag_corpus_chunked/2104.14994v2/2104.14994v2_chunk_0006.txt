Geolocation based Wiki, Image, News and Event Retrieval type and located in the selected radius (in kilometers) of the pre- dicted geocoordinates. The user specifies the radius and selects the entity types of interest from the available 12 groups. 2.2.3 Retrieval of Metadata and Images. Eventually, correspond- ing text descriptions and images are downloaded for the retrieved entities. We extract Wikimedia Commons links of the images and the Wikipedia link for each queried entity using MediaWiki and Wikidata query APIs (Application Programming Interface)4. 2.3 Visual Search Embeddings Module To generate the visual representations, state-of-the-art approaches in computer vision are applied. TheGeolocation embedding is taken from the same model used for geolocation estimation [ 8] (Sec- tion 2.1). The Place embedding is another representation based on a ResNet model [7] to recognize 365 distinct places like beach or street. Another embedding applied here is Object embedding based on a ResNet model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset for image classification [6]. Each of the embeddings is encoded in a vector of size 2048. Eventually, the Combined is resulted from concatenation of all three to get a more general visual representation. These repre- sentations are employed to rank the retrieved entities (Section 2.2.2) based on similarity to the input query image. The similarity be- tween the entity image and the query image is computed using the cosine similarity of their corresponding image embeddings. 2.4 News and Event Retrieval Modules Given the query image, the user can select the corresponding news articles or events for the retrieved entities within the defined radius. We use EventRegistry to retrieve news for each entity, which is a repository of news in different domains, locations and languages. To get relevant news for each selected entity, its Wikidata label is used as a keyword to query the relevant news.
