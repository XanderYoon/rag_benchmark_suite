used to query Wikidata [12] to retrieve entities within the selected radius and entity types by the user. In this way, the user can select an entity on the map to get back the relevant news and events in order to check whether the input image is relevant to the retrieved documents or their corresponding images. Another useful application is the verification of images based on the retrieved entities. For instance, given an image of a scenery, the system recommends a ranked list of visually similar places within a selected radius in order to verify the label of the input image. From another perspective the system could also be useful in meta information verification of news. For instance to see if the location claimed of a news matches the location of its image. 2 METHOD In this section, we describe the five modules of the GeoWINE system. The basic functionality is shown in Figure 1. 2.1 Geolocation Estimation Module The goal of geolocation estimation is to predict latitude and longi- tude coordinates where photo was captured, using only the visual 2https://github.com/cleopatra-itn/GeoWINE content without any other metadata. We apply the model3 [8] based on ResNet101 [7] pretrained on a subset of the Yahoo Flickr Creative Commons 100 Million dataset (YFCC100M) [11] with around five million geo-tagged images. In this model, geolocation estimation is treated as a classification problem where the earth is subdivided into geographical cells. This approach exploits the hierarchical representation of multiple partitionings and additionally takes the photo’s scene category into account, i.e., whether it depicts indoor, natural, or urban setting. 2.2 Geospatial-based Entity Retrieval Module The primary knowledge source for our system is the Wikidata knowledge graph [12] which is a free and open knowledge base that can be read and edited by both humans and machines.
