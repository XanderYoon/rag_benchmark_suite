representation of multiple partitionings and additionally takes the photo’s scene category into account, i.e., whether it depicts indoor, natural, or urban setting. 2.2 Geospatial-based Entity Retrieval Module The primary knowledge source for our system is the Wikidata knowledge graph [12] which is a free and open knowledge base that can be read and edited by both humans and machines. Since Wikidata is a rich source for data with semantic relations between entities and gives continuous access using public SPARQL (Simple Protocol and RDF Query Language) endpoint, it meets our require- ments for entity retrieval. 2.2.1 Determining Common Entity Types. In order to determine entity types for the retrieval task, we use an index set from the Google Landmarks dataset [13]. Each image in the index set is linked with the corresponding Wikimedia Commons category, which is also linked with a Wikidata entity. We query the types of Wikidata entities using the instance of (P31) of each image and count their occurrences. The most frequent 35 entity types are selected and clustered in 12 groups where each group contains similar entity types. For instance, Religious building contains entity types such as church building, cathedral, Buddhist temple, shrine, etc. The full list of entity groups is given in Table 1. 2.2.2 Querying Entities from Wikidata. The geolocation estimation module (Section 2.1) outputs the geocoordinates for an input image. In this step, we query Wikidata to retrieve entities of the specified 3https://github.com/TIBHannover/GeoEstimation/tree/pytorch GeoWINE: Geolocation based Wiki, Image, News and Event Retrieval type and located in the selected radius (in kilometers) of the pre- dicted geocoordinates. The user specifies the radius and selects the entity types of interest from the available 12 groups. 2.2.3 Retrieval of Metadata and Images. Eventually, correspond- ing text descriptions and images are downloaded for the retrieved entities. We extract
