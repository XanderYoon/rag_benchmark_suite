the user can select the corresponding news articles or events for the retrieved entities within the defined radius. We use EventRegistry to retrieve news for each entity, which is a repository of news in different domains, locations and languages. To get relevant news for each selected entity, its Wikidata label is used as a keyword to query the relevant news. Regarding the events, we use OEKG [5], which is a multilingual, event-centric, temporal knowledge graph composed of different datasets linked to Event-centric Knowledge Graph (EventKG) [4]. These datasets come from multiple application domains such as question answering, entity recommendation, and named entity recognition. We use the OEKG endpoint 5 to query the relevant events from the knowledge graph for the selected Wikidata entity. 3 SYSTEM OVERVIEW An overview of the proposed system is shown in Figure 1. The demonstrator consists of a frontend and a Python Flask server as the backend. 3.1 Frontend The frontend was built using React JS (JavaScript), an open-source JavaScript library for user interface components. The page com- prises four main panels: 1) the panel to provide the query image (either by selecting an existing one or uploading new images) along- side the entity type and radius, 2) the map that displays the entity results, 3) the panel that provides entity details, news and events, and 4) the ordered entities based on the similarity to the input image. 4https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page 5http://oekg.l3s.uni-hannover.de/sparql Figure 2: Snapshots of the demonstration on a sample image. Once the user presses the search button, the provided image, the selected entity type, and the defined radius are sent to the backend. 3.2 Backend In the backend, the request is sent to a Python Flask application in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format. Then, the application forwards the request to an initialized instance of GeoWINE, which
