presented at the bottom. These images correspond to the retrieved entities on the map and they are ranked based on similarity to the input image. There are four different options here: similar ge- olocations/entities, similar places, overall similarity by ImageNet embeddings, and combined search. These four different ranked lists correspond to the four different visual representations: Geolocation, Place, Object and Combined respectively (Section 2.3).

As mentioned in Section 2.2.1, we identified the most frequent entity types and formed 12 distinct groups by clustering the types of similar imagery. Then, we selected one type from each group and downloaded the images, which yielded 13280 images in total. The goal is to
