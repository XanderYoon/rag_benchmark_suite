evaluation of the presented demon- strator on a subset of the Google Landmarks dataset. As mentioned in Section 2.2.1, we identified the most frequent entity types and formed 12 distinct groups by clustering the types of similar imagery. Then, we selected one type from each group and downloaded the images, which yielded 13280 images in total. The goal is to see if the system is able to retrieve the corresponding Wikidata [12] entity when the Wikimedia Commons image is given as the query. Initially, we have run the geolocation estimation model on the query images and discarded query images whose estimated geocoordinate errors are above city level (25 kilometres) based on Great Circle Distance (GCD) in comparison with the ground truth geocoordinates. From the remaining 1285 images, we extract geolocation embeddings and rank the retrieved entities based on the similarity to the input image. In order to make the evaluation fair, we discarded all the queries where the image was the same as the Wikidata image by comparing the hash codes of the query and the retrieved images. For the remaining 275 query images, the top-𝑘 accuracy is given in Table 1 for different input entity groups. As the Table shows, 84%, 76%, and 52% of the test queries are ranked among the top 10, top 5, and top 1, respectively. Among the top-10 results, Waterfall and Bridge, among the top-5 Building and among top-1 Waterfall entity groups have the highest accuracy. In all the top-k results, Religious building achieves the lowest accuracy. Overall, the experimental results show the feasibility and usability of the whole system for different types of landmarks. 6 CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have introduced the GeoWINE demonstrator, a geolocation-based multimodal retrieval system aimed at supporting different kinds of applications such as fact-checking, fake news de-
