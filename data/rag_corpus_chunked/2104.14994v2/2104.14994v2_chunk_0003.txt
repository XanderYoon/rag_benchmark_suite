Finally, the last two modules retrieve similar news and events from EventRegistry and OEKG. 1http://eventregistry.org/ arXiv:2104.14994v2 [cs.IR] 4 May 2021 Tahmasebzadeh et al. cleopatra.ijs.si/geowine/ Input (Image, types, radius) Map Entity News Events Results Ranked by similarity Frontend Backend UI (React JS) Python Flask App Forward Response Image, Types, Radius Geolocation Estimation Entity Retrieval Embeddings & Similarities News Retrieval Events Retrieval Event RegistryOEKG Wikidata Wikipedia GeoWINE Forward Request Entities, News, Events, Meta info. Step 1 Step 2 Step 3 Step 4Step 5 Figure 1: Overview of the GeoWINE architecture. We evaluate GeoWINE on Google Landmarks dataset [13], where it achieves promising performance in predicting entity labels of query images. GeoWINE enables users to retrieve entities, news, and events related to an image, through a clean and intuitive User Inter- face (UI), with interactive response times. To the best of our knowl- edge, this is the first public and open-source demo for geolocation- based multimodal retrieval through various sources. To facilitate reproducibility and reuse, all material is publicly available2. Use cases. The proposed system provides various search sce- narios each of which could be addressed as a use case. One of the use cases is to assist journalists or social scientists in fact-checking or fake news detection [9]. Given a query image as an input, the system could be used to contextualize the image by retrieving rel- evant documents. First, the geolocation is predicted and then the predicted coordinates are used to query Wikidata [12] to retrieve entities within the selected radius and entity types by the user. In this way, the user can select an entity on the map to get back the relevant news and events in order to check whether the input image is relevant to the retrieved documents or their corresponding images. Another useful application is
