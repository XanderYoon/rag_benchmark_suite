closely with the retrieved context. 5. Discussion The experiments conducted in this study aimed to refine the Retrieval-Augmented Gener- ation (RAG) pipeline for academic literature, focusing on enhancing the retrieval of context relevant to data science-related queries. Several configurations were evaluated across key metrics, including Context Relevance (CR), Faithfulness, and Answer Relevance, providing insight into how different components of the pipeline affect its overall performance. The emphasis of this work was on improving CR, given its direct correlation with the ability to retrieve pertinent context from large corpora of academic literature. One of the key findings is the positive impact of fine-tuning on CR across all configura- tions. Models that were fine-tuned using domain-specific textbooks, particularly in Experi- ments 2 and 5, consistently outperformed the baseline model in retrieving context relevant to 19 the query. This highlights the importance of curating high-quality, domain-specific datasets when fine-tuning language models to optimize their performance for specialized tasks. The results also suggest that increasing the size of the fine-tuning corpus, as seen in Experiment 2, improves not only CR but also Faithfulness and Answer Relevance. This trend underscores the value of larger and more comprehensive training datasets for improving the system’s ability to retrieve and use relevant information. The introduction of GROBID provided mixed results. While it significantly improved CR by structuring the data for more precise retrieval, its incorporation without sufficient fine-tuning, as seen in Experiment 3, led to a noticeable drop in CR. This suggests that while GROBID’s document structuring is beneficial, it must be paired with ample training data to ensure that critical context is not inadvertently removed during preprocessing. The combination of GROBID with fine-tuning on larger datasets restored CR to higher levels, as observed in Experiments 4 and 5, indicating that the issues introduced by GROBID can be
