challenge of exploring large volumes of full-text content to identify key insights. The abstract- first method thus potentially represents a significant advancement in the design of RAG systems, offering a sophisticated alternative to traditional full-text search strategies. In the fifth stage of our enhancement process, we implement advanced prompting tech- niques to optimize the responses generated by our RAG application. This stage involves in- corporating strategies such as tip-offering and emotional prompting, which have been shown to enhance the performance and contextual relevance of Large Language Models (LLMs). For example, [30] demonstrated that even minor adjustments to prompts, such as offering tips or slight rephrasing, can lead to substantial improvements in the precision and relevance of LLM outputs. This underscores the importance of carefully crafted prompts in refining the responses generated by RAG systems. Similarly, [19] showed that emotional prompting, where prompts are infused with emotional cues, can improve the LLM’s ability to produce more empathetic and contextually rich responses, which is particularly valuable in applica- tions requiring a nuanced understanding of user needs, such as mental health support or customer service. By integrating these advanced prompting techniques into the RAG model, we aim to improve the performance of the LLM while also offering prompts that direct the model to produce more precise and contextually relevant responses, ultimately enhancing the utility and effectiveness of our application. 3. Methods In this section, we will first present the original RAG approach and provide the details of the enhanced RAG architecture we have developed in this research. Additionally, we will explain the experimental design and present the performance metrics used to evaluate the effectiveness of the alternatives. 3.1. Overview of RAG Architecture and Data Preparation In the progression from an original RAG architecture to our enhanced version, significant modifications were made to improve
