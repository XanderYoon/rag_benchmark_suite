to potential gaps in their literature reviews [24]. A promising approach to addressing the challenge of navigating the extensive litera- ture in data science is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [18]. RAG’s capacity to access external knowledge bases makes it a valuable tool for managing and comprehending the vast literature in the field. The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) within the RAG pipeline further enhances this capability by making the process of understanding complex academic papers and their core contributions more manageable. By retrieving con- textually relevant information and summarizing it effectively, RAG assists data scientists in quickly grasping the key contributions of numerous papers, thus mitigating the burden of information overload. RAG models have demonstrated considerable promise in tasks such as question-answering and dialogue systems, where the ability to dynamically retrieve pertinent information from external sources is essential [12]. This capability is particularly valuable in the fast-growing field of data science, where synthesizing and analyzing an expanding body of literature is critical. RAG has been adopted across various industries, including healthcare, legal, and edu- cation to enhance domain-specific applications and address the challenges of these fields. In healthcare, RAG models support clinicians by providing evidence-based recommenda- tions from up-to-date medical literature and databases, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. For example, the MKRAG framework has improved medical question answering by integrating medical facts from external knowledge bases into the generation process, thereby increasing the accuracy of responses and aiding clinicians in making in- formed decisions [32]. In the legal field, one method to improve question-answering systems 4 involves the integration of RAG models with Case-Based Reasoning (CBR). This CBR- RAG approach enhances LLM queries with contextually relevant legal cases, improving the retrieval of pertinent precedents and statutes. This method is among the strategies devel- oped to provide more accurate and
