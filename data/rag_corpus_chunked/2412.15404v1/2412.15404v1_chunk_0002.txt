the ability of researchers and practitioners to identify and integrate relevant insights into their work, highlighting the need for effective tools and strategies to navigate this expanding landscape. To mitigate this issue, in this research, we have developed a RAG application specifically designed to aid data scientists in navigating academic resources and obtaining guidance tailored to their unique needs. This application encompasses a broad spectrum of data science subfields, including machine learning, deep learning, time series modeling, synthetic data generation, reinforcement learning, data preprocessing, feature engineering, and evaluation. The value of our RAG application is evident in its ability to provide precise and contextually relevant responses to specific queries posed by data scientists. This tool not only conserves time but also improves the accuracy of decisions made throughout the data science workflow by integrating advanced techniques for retrieving and embedding pertinent academic insights into a LLM. Consequently, the application enables users to make well-informed decisions regarding methodologies and techniques, thereby contributing to the development of more effective and innovative solutions for their projects. Our objective with this application is to systematically combine and assess the per- formance of a range of established techniques within the RAG framework, reporting their effectiveness within a particular domain to generate insights valuable to researchers. By conducting a comprehensive evaluation of these methods in a real-world setting, we aim to facilitate the broader adoption of these approaches in both academic and industrial contexts. Our RAG application responds to a significant need within the data science community for accessible and relevant academic guidance. Unlike traditional literature review meth- ods, which can be time-consuming and overwhelming due to the vast amount of available information, our application facilitates the process by extracting and embedding only the most pertinent sections of articles into the LLM. This approach accelerates decision-making
