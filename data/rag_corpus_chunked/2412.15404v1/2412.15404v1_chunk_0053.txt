and longer-term impacts of tweets on financial markets. This technique allows for the generation of sentiment scores and the mapping of these sentiments to market prices, enhancing predictive accuracy. Additionally, it pro- vides insights into the linguistic trig- gers that influence market fluctuations, improving model interpretability.
