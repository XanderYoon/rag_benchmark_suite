By calculating the cosine similarity between these embeddings, we grouped sentences into semantically coherent chunks. A similarity threshold was needed to be chosen to separate the chunks so that they were neither too fragmented nor overly broad. Also, achieving a comparable word count was crucial to ensure that the metrics were fair and directly comparable across different experiments. Through careful adjustment of the similarity threshold, semantically coherent sentence clusters were formed while preserving a comparable word count to other experimental contexts, thereby ensuring the equitable comparability of metrics. This approach in general was particularly important because it directly influenced the performance of our RAG application in terms of both the relevance and coherence of the retrieved information. These findings are consistent with previous research suggesting that relationships between words within a sentence often convey more about the underlying semantic content than the individual words themselves [29]. 3.5. Abstract-first Method Our fourth stage introduced an innovative abstract-first search strategy, designed to simplify the retrieval process by initially searching a vector database composed solely of article abstracts. Abstracts, being concise summaries of research findings and methodologies, offer a quick and efficient means of assessing the relevance of a document. By embedding the query and searching within this abstract database first, we could filter out irrelevant articles early in the process. The titles of the top 100 most relevant articles were then used to conduct a more focused search in the larger vector database containing the full articles. As detailed in the experimental analysis we will discuss later, this method significantly improved search efficiency and accuracy, reducing computational load and speeding up retrieval times. 11 3.6. Enhanced Prompting Technique In the final stage, we optimized the interaction between the LLM and the retrieved context by experimenting with various prompting techniques. Although the default
