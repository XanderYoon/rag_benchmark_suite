a degree of subjectivity into the assessment, potentially affecting the interpretation of the results. Additionally, the reliance on a custom test set, developed specifically for this study, poses another limitation. Although the questions were designed to reflect realistic challenges in data science, the lack of a widely accepted benchmark for RAG evaluation in academic literature restricts the generalizability of the findings. Future research should aim to establish standardized benchmarks and ground truth datasets to facilitate more robust and comparable evaluations across studies. Appendix A. Advanced Data Science Questions 1. I’m a data scientist in the financial sector, selecting features to predict stock prices. I’ve used traditional methods like backward elimination. Which advanced feature selection technique should I consider to enhance model performance? 2. In the context of agriculture, I’m predicting crop yields based on soil and weather data. Having tried manual feature selection, what automated feature selection method would help in identifying the most influential factors for yield prediction? 3. As a data scientist in the insurance industry, I’m working on customer churn predic- tion. I’ve used correlation-based feature selection but need to account for nonlinear relationships. Which technique would be suitable for this purpose? 21 4. Working in the healthcare sector, I deal with patient vital signs data that often contains outliers. After using the Z-score for outlier detection, what robust outlier elimination technique should I adopt for cleaner datasets? 5. In the manufacturing industry, I’m analyzing sensor data from machinery for predictive maintenance. Having used the IQR method to detect outliers, which advanced tech- nique would you recommend for more accurate anomaly detection and elimination? 6. I’m analyzing customer behavior data in e-commerce, using PCA for dimensionality reduction. Can you suggest a modern technique that might offer better insights while preserving data variance? 7. In environmental science, I
