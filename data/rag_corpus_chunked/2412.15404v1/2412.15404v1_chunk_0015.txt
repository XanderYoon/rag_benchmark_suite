the CRISP-DM framework: Data Prepa- ration, Modeling, and Evaluation, with 10 questions dedicated to Data Preparation, 35 to Modeling, and 5 to Evaluation. Within the Data Preparation stage, we targeted essential areas such as feature selec- tion (3 questions), outlier elimination (2 questions), and dimension reduction (5 questions). The Modeling stage, which often demands the most academic guidance, included questions on synthetic data generation (3 questions), classification (5 questions), regression (5 ques- tions), clustering (5 questions), reinforcement learning (2 questions), image recognition (5 questions), natural language processing (5 questions), and time series analysis (5 questions). Lastly, the Evaluation stage comprised 5 questions focused on assessing model performance. Each question was designed to address specific subdomains and techniques, ensuring a rigor- ous assessment of the RAG application across multiple aspects of data science. The complete list of questions is provided in Appendix A. For instance, one of our questions is: ”As a data scientist in the financial sector tasked with predicting stock prices, I have used traditional feature selection methods like backward elimination. Which advanced feature selection technique should I consider to enhance model performance?” This format ensured that the questions were realistic and reflective of the actual challenges faced by professionals in the field. In our analysis, arXiv API was employed to retrieve relevant articles necessary for con- structing a vector database. We used arXiv [40] since it is a prominent platform that allows 8 Figure 2: Our Enhanced RAG Architecture researchers to share their scientific and academic papers before undergoing the peer-review process [15]. For the analysis, each test question was first translated into a detailed search query, compatible with the arXiv API. This conversion process was facilitated by GPT-4o using a specific prompt designed to condense each question into a targeted search query: ”Transform the following detailed inquiry
