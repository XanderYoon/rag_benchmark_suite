promoted tweets obtain less engagement than promoted trends, their engagement forms are often more brand-inclusive. •features of the event as the location of the event’s peak, its growth and relaxation signatures, contain valuable information and must be used in the analytics. The predictive power of Twitter events in this study was evaluated using two scenarios: in the first scenario, we performed the analysis for the aggregated Twitter signal considering only tweets’ sentiment; in the second scenario, we cluster Twitter sentiment events based on their shape and then calculate the statistics of successful pre- dictions separately for every event type. The results of our analysis can be summarized as follows: - Aggregated Twitter events can be used to predict sales spikes. - Spikes can be separated into categories based on their shapes (position of the peak, growth, and relaxation signatures). - Different spike shapes are differently associated with sales. - Some spike types have a higher predictive power than the aggregated Twitter signal. •This shows that Twitter users do not tweet as positively about a pro- moted trend as they would about a promoted tweet. Instead, a large proportion of tweets relating to a promoted trend contained no emo- tional words, or if they did, the positive and negative sentiments bal- anced each other out. They generally contained just the promoted hash- tag or generally had an objective, matter-of-fact tone (e.g., - “Get 3G where I live... #O2WhatWouldYouDo”).Figure 11:# related engage- ments •Social media sites like Facebook and Twitter have emerged as popu- lar destinations for users to get real-time news about the world around them.
