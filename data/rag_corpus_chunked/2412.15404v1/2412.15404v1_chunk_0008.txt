in making in- formed decisions [32]. In the legal field, one method to improve question-answering systems 4 involves the integration of RAG models with Case-Based Reasoning (CBR). This CBR- RAG approach enhances LLM queries with contextually relevant legal cases, improving the retrieval of pertinent precedents and statutes. This method is among the strategies devel- oped to provide more accurate and contextually relevant answers to complex legal queries, thereby increasing the efficiency and accuracy of legal research [39]. Additionally, systems like LegalAsst utilize AI-powered tools for precise legal case retrieval, incorporating struc- tured representations and decision-tree-based judgments to streamline court procedures, thus enhancing legal assistance and court productivity through improved retrieval accuracy of similar cases and relevant legislation [10]. In education, RAG models are utilized to improve math question-answering by incorporating vetted external content, such as scripts from high- quality open-source textbooks, into LLM prompts. This method has been shown to improve response quality, assisting students and educators in navigating complex problems with con- textually relevant support, although designers must balance the trade-offs between aligning responses with educational resources and meeting student preferences [17]. RAG applications have significantly streamlined the academic literature review process. For example, KNIMEZoBot [2] integrates Zotero with KNIME and OpenAI’s language mod- els to automate citation management and literature generation, reducing the time and effort required for comprehensive reviews. LitLLM [1] further enhances this process by synthesizing large volumes of research into concise, field-specific summaries, making it an invaluable tool for scientific researchers. In the biomedical field, RefAI [20] employs a GPT-powered RAG system to manage complex terminologies and research details with precision. Collectively, these tools illustrate the growing influence of RAG technology in transforming literature reviews, offering tailored and efficient solutions across diverse academic disciplines. Despite the advancements offered by RAG applications, substantial challenges remain, particularly
