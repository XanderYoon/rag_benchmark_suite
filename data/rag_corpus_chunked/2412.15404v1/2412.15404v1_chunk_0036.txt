demonstrated that a concise, abstract-based search can still maintain high relevance in context retrieval. However, it remains to be seen whether this strategy is as effective in other domains where abstracts may not fully capture the nuances of the article’s content, presenting an area for future research. The Enhanced Prompting Technique, while not affecting CR directly, improved An- swer Relevance by guiding the LLM to better utilize the retrieved context when generating answers. Since the LLM combines the retrieved context with the query to produce the re- sponse, the prompt’s structure plays a pivotal role in maximizing the utility of the language model. The relatively stable CR across configurations that employed enhanced prompting confirms that this technique’s impact is not on retrieval but rather on improving how well the model aligns its responses with the given context. This result underscores the impor- tance of prompt design in optimizing response generation. Moreover, there remains room for further improvements in prompt alignment, as the open-ended nature of prompts offers opportunities to refine how context and query are combined to generate more precise and contextually accurate responses. In future enhancements, incorporating knowledge graph-based approaches for automating the validation and structuring of retrieved content could significantly improve the accuracy 20 and reliability of RAG applications. Such techniques, as demonstrated in the construction and validation of behavioral models using automated knowledge extraction, show promise for dynamically synthesizing robust and relevant information from diverse sources [35]. By integrating these methods, RAG systems could better manage complex information retrieval tasks, thereby further enhancing decision-making processes across various domains. 6. Conclusion In conclusion, this study illustrates that the proposed Enhanced RAG Architecture, which integrates fine-tuning on domain-specific datasets, employs GROBID for data structuring, implements Semantic Chunking, and utilizes an Abstract-First strategy, significantly en- hances the capability of the
