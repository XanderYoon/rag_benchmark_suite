in retrieved context (1) Where |S| is the number of sentences in the retrieved context that are relevant to an- swering the given question. A high Context Relevance score indicates that the retrieved context is highly focused and contains minimal extraneous information. This metric is particularly important in our application because our enhancements aim to optimize the retrieval and presentation of contextually accurate information. 12 Faithfulness assesses the factual consistency of the textitgenerated answer with the re- trieved context. It is calculated by comparing the claims made in the generated answer with the information provided in the context. The metric also ranges from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating better factual accuracy. This metric ensures that the generated response is grounded in the retrieved context, avoiding hallucinations and maintaining factual accuracy. For our application, Faithfulness is also crucial because it directly impacts the reliability of the responses provided to data scientists. Faithfulness score = Number of claims in the generated answer that can be inferred from the given context Total number of claims in the generated answer (2) Answer Relevance evaluates how well the generated answer addresses the provided query. This metric is assessed by computing the cosine similarity between the embeddings of the original question and the generated question, which is reverse-engineered from the answer. A higher Answer Relevance score indicates that the generated answer closely aligns with the original question, ensuring that the response is relevant and directly addresses the user’s query. In our context, Answer Relevance is vital for assessing the overall effectiveness of the RAG application in producing useful and accurate responses. Answer Relevance = 1 N NX i=1 cos(Egi, Eo) (3) Where: • Egi is the embedding of the generated question i. • Eo is the embedding of the original question. • N is
