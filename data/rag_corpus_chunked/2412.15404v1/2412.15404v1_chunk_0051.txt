dynamic elements. The nature of news has changed considerably, with users now primarily accessing information online through various social media platforms rather than relying solely on traditional printed newspapers. Consequently, social media posts play a crucial role in shaping the financial market, es- pecially when authored by influential leaders, significantly amplifying their impact. In this study, we explore the impact of social media posts, such as tweets, on the financial market using artificial intelligence. We analyze the relationship between tweets and stock prices through the application of Natural Language Processing. This motivation propels us to develop a sophisticated model that can effectively analyze the in- fluence of social media posts, particularly tweets, on financial markets. 1. Beyond Traditional Models and Temporal Sentiment Dynamics: In contrast to existing financial market prediction models employed by investment banks, which predominantly rely on historical price anal- ysis, our model extends its reach by considering the influential voices of market leaders on social media platforms. By incorporating Twitter sentiments, we introduce a state-of-the-art Memory-based Sentiment Analysis, which goes beyond immediate effects by gauging the tempo- ral impact of tweets on financial market prices. Twitter Sentiment: Our model adopts a multistep learning process, beginning with learn- ing to analyze Twitter sentiment. This phase involves the generation of sentiment scores and categorization into positive, negative, or neu- tral sentiment statuses based on leaders’ tweets. This state-of-the-art approach enables the system to discern the emotional tone of leaders’ voices in real-time. Additionally, historical sentiment patterns from previous n days are used to capture more enduring effects on market prices. This dual approach enhances our model’s predictive accuracy by considering both the immediate and longer-term impacts of social media sentiments on financial markets. Building on sentiment analy- sis, our model progresses to learn to map tweet sentiments with dif-
