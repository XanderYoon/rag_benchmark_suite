voices in real-time. Additionally, historical sentiment patterns from previous n days are used to capture more enduring effects on market prices. This dual approach enhances our model’s predictive accuracy by considering both the immediate and longer-term impacts of social media sentiments on financial markets. Building on sentiment analy- sis, our model progresses to learn to map tweet sentiments with dif- ferent financial components. Here, the model establishes a connection between sentiment scores and statuses with dated market prices, effec- tively synchronizing the ebb and flow of sentiments with market trends. This mapping provides a comprehensive understanding of how social media sentiments correlate with financial components. Mapping: The final phase, learning to predict the price using tweets stock mapping, equips the model with the ability to forecast financial market fluctu- ations based on the established mapping between social media senti- ments and historical prices. This integration allows our model to offer timely and state-of-the-art predictions that consider both traditional market factors and social media dynamics. To enhance interpretabil- ity, this essentially teaches a backtraversal mechanism. By analyzing the effects of specific words or sets of words on Twitter that influence market fluctuations, the system gains the ability to identify and high- light the linguistic triggers influencing financial markets. This granular analysis enhances the model’s transparency and provides state-of-the- art insights into the relationship between social media sentiments and market movements. Consider using Memory-based Senti- ment Analysis, which captures both imme- diate and longer-term impacts of tweets on financial markets. This technique allows for the generation of sentiment scores and the mapping of these sentiments to market prices, enhancing predictive accuracy. Additionally, it pro- vides insights into the linguistic trig- gers that influence market fluctuations, improving model interpretability.
