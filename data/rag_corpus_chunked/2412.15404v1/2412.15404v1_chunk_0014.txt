provide the details of the enhanced RAG architecture we have developed in this research. Additionally, we will explain the experimental design and present the performance metrics used to evaluate the effectiveness of the alternatives. 3.1. Overview of RAG Architecture and Data Preparation In the progression from an original RAG architecture to our enhanced version, significant modifications were made to improve the system’s accuracy, relevance, and efficiency. Figure 1 illustrates the basic RAG architecture, where a user’s query is first embedded and then used to search a vector database for relevant document chunks. These retrieved chunks, along with the original query, are then fed into a language model to generate the final output. In contrast, Figure 2 showcases our enhanced RAG architecture, where we have introduced several critical innovations, highlighted in blue, to address the limitations of the classical approach. These enhancements include advanced data cleaning, fine-tuned 7 Figure 1: Original RAG Architecture embedding models, semantic chunking, a novel abstract-first search strategy, and improved prompting techniques. The details of these improvements are outlined below. To thoroughly evaluate our enhanced RAG application, we developed a comprehensive set of 50 questions covering various sectors such as telecommunications, agriculture, and others, reflecting the diverse challenges encountered in data science. These questions were meticulously crafted according to the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology [26], a widely recognized framework in the data science community. The question set spans the three major stages of the CRISP-DM framework: Data Prepa- ration, Modeling, and Evaluation, with 10 questions dedicated to Data Preparation, 35 to Modeling, and 5 to Evaluation. Within the Data Preparation stage, we targeted essential areas such as feature selec- tion (3 questions), outlier elimination (2 questions), and dimension reduction (5 questions). The Modeling stage, which often demands the most academic guidance, included questions
