This paper presents an enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application, an artificial intelligence (AI)-based system designed to assist data scientists in accessing precise and contextually relevant academic resources. The AI-powered application integrates advanced techniques, including the GeneRation Of BIbliographic Data (GROBID) technique for extracting biblio- graphic information, fine-tuned embedding models, semantic chunking, and an abstract-first retrieval method, to significantly improve the relevance and accuracy of the retrieved infor- mation. This implementation of AI specifically addresses the challenge of academic literature navigation. A comprehensive evaluation using the Retrieval-Augmented Generation Assess- ment System (RAGAS) framework demonstrates substantial improvements in key metrics, particularly Context Relevance, underscoring the system’s effectiveness in reducing informa- tion overload and enhancing decision-making processes. Our findings highlight the potential of this enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation system to transform academic exploration within data science, ultimately advancing the workflow of research and innovation in the field.

Introduction Like other Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) technologies—such as image, video, and audio generation—Large Language Models (LLMs) that produce text also possess the po- tential to disrupt both business and social life by transforming how information is processed and decisions are made. However, a significant drawback of LLMs is their current tendency to produce ”hallucinations” (i.e., inaccurate or misleading outputs), which can undermine trust in their applications. To address this issue, ongoing research explores Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) as a promising solution to mitigate these inaccuracies. Moreover, across various disciplines, practitioners, and researchers
