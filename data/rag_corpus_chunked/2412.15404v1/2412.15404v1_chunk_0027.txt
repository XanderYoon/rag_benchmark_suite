Since it is crucial for the embedding to accurately understand the query and obtain the relevant chunks, focusing on Context Rele- vance allows us to detect the contributions of different fine-tuning experiments more precisely. To statistically evaluate the significance of the differences in Context Relevance across config- urations, we employed Welch’s ANOVA followed by Tukey’s HSD test for post-hoc analysis [38] [37]. Welch’s ANOVA was chosen because it does not assume equal variances, making it a more robust method when the homogeneity of variances assumption is violated. This approach ensures the reliability of the results by accounting for variance differences across the experiments. Tukey’s HSD test was then applied to identify which specific pairwise comparisons showed statistically significant differences, providing a detailed understanding of the performance variations between the configurations. The results of Tukey’s HSD tests presented in Table 2 indicate a statistically significant (with p <0.001) enhancement in Context Relevance from the baseline Experiment 1 (No 15 FT) to Experiment 3 (17 TB). Evidently, Experiment 3 exhibits a statistically significant superiority over all other experimental conditions concerning Context Relevance. While the results for Experiment 6 (17 TB + G + SNS), Experiment 2 (5 TB), and Experiment 5 (17 TB + G) are closely aligned,
