to ensure my models are both accurate and fair? 50. As a data scientist in manufacturing, I’m assessing the performance of predictive main- tenance models. Beyond traditional metrics, which evaluation method should I use to measure the real-world impact of my models? Appendix B. 5 Textbooks 1. Aggarwal, C. C. (2018).
