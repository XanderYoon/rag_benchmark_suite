an invaluable tool for scientific researchers. In the biomedical field, RefAI [20] employs a GPT-powered RAG system to manage complex terminologies and research details with precision. Collectively, these tools illustrate the growing influence of RAG technology in transforming literature reviews, offering tailored and efficient solutions across diverse academic disciplines. Despite the advancements offered by RAG applications, substantial challenges remain, particularly regarding information overload and contextual relevance. For instance, cur- rent models often retrieve passages indiscriminately, without regard to whether they are factually grounded or contextually appropriate, which can result in low-quality outputs con- taining irrelevant or off-topic information [33]. Furthermore, the accuracy and reliability of the generated content are not guaranteed, as these models are not always explicitly trained to leverage facts from the retrieved passages, leading to potential inconsistencies [8]. Addi- tionally, handling complex and domain-specific queries remains a significant issue, as RAG models often require fine-tuning to improve their accuracy and effectiveness in specialized fields [34]. Moreover, obtaining a high-quality retrieval model that effectively fetches relevant documents is an ongoing challenge that impacts the overall performance of these systems [3]. To address the limitations identified in traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models, we propose a comprehensive five-stage enhancement process that significantly im- proves the performance, accuracy, and relevance of RAG applications. This process is de- signed to handle the complexities of domain-specific queries, ensuring that the information retrieved is not only pertinent but also aligned with the user’s context and intent. Each stage of our approach contributes to refining different aspects of the RAG system, from data cleaning and embedding fine-tuning to semantic chunking, abstract-first retrieval, and advanced prompting techniques. Collectively, these innovations have the potential to sig- nificantly reduce information overload and improve the contextual relevance of responses, thereby providing a robust solution to the common challenges encountered
