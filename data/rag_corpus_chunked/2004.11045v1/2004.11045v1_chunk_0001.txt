of neural ranking in which a mo del selects a suitable response from a set of candidates given a c onver- sation history. Retrieval-based chat-bots are typically employed in information seeking conversational systems such as customer sup- port agents. They have been used in real-world products such as Microsoft XiaoIce [15] and Alibaba GroupâĂŹs AliMe Assist [ 9]. To ﬁnd the best response to a particular conversation’s chat his- tory traditional text retrieval methods such as term frequency have proven to be insuﬃcient [10], therefore the majority of mode rn re- search focuses on neural ranking approaches [4, 6, 10]. These meth- ods rely on training artiﬁcial neural networks on large data sets for Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of thi s work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies ar e not made or distributed for proﬁt or commercial advantage and that copies bear this n otice and the full cita- tion on the ﬁrst page.

By pre-training large scale language models on vast corporaand subsequently ﬁne-tuning these models on downstream tasks, re- searchers have achieved state-of-the-art results in a widevariety of natural language tasks [3]. This process has also been succe ssfully applied to the task of response retrieval [4, 6, 13]. Current state-of- the-art response retrieval focuses on
