Retrieval-based chat-bots are typically employed in information seeking conversational systems such as cust omer support agents. In order to make pairwise comparisons betwe en a conversation history and a candidate response, two approa ches are common: cross-encoders performing full self-attentio n over the pair and bi-encoders encoding the pair separately. The f ormer gives better prediction quality but is too slow for practica l use. In this paper, we propose a new cross-encoder architecture and trans- fer knowledge from this model to a bi-encoder model using dis til- lation. This eﬀectively boosts bi-encoder performance at n o cost during inference time. We perform a detailed analysis of thi s ap- proach on three response retrieval datasets.

Retrieval-based chat-bots are typically employed in information seeking conversational systems such as customer sup- port agents. They have been used in real-world products such as Microsoft XiaoIce [15] and Alibaba GroupâĂŹs AliMe Assist [ 9]. To ﬁnd
