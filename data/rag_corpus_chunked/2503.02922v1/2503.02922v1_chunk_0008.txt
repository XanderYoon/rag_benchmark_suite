tasks into structured sequences of actions, such as identifying participants, summarizing conversations, and executing planned steps. ReadAgent [20] condenses documents into gists while maintaining a memory directory to facilitate recall of relevant details for task completion. Knowledge Graph Prompting (KGP) [43] structures documents as a graph and utilizes a traversal agent to retrieve passages that are most relevant to a given query. GraphReader [21] compresses text into key elements and facts, em- bedding them into a graph where an agent explores nodes and their connections to gather sufficient information. In this paper, we focus on GraphRAG [ 12] and RAPTOR [35], two widely adopted graph-based RAG techniques that have demon- strated robust performance and are representative of current graph- enhanced RAG approaches in practice. 2.2.1 RAPTOR. RAPTOR organizes text into a hierarchical tree, applying Gaussian Mixture Models for clustering and iterative sum- marization. This structure allows efficient retrieval at multiple levels of granularity, ensuring scalability in both build time and token usage [35]. 2.2.2 GraphRAG. GraphRAG enhances QA by structuring extracted entities and relationships into a knowledge graph. It applies the Leiden algorithm to identify community clusters, generating sum- maries used as contextual input for answering queries [12]. Our evaluation focuses on these two techniques as represen- tative graph-based RAG approaches. While other methodologies offer valuable innovations, expanding this comparison remains an avenue for future research. 3 TREX 3.1 Task Setup Our task can be formalized by the following. Given an open-domain question 𝑞 and a large body of text 𝐷, we want to develop a system that can efficiently retrieve the most relevant information from 𝐷, or a list of text chunks,Retrieve(𝑞, 𝐷) = {𝑐1, 𝑐2, . . . , 𝑐𝑘 }, to generate the correct answer 𝐴 given possible answers 𝐴ˆ to the question 𝑞. In other words,
