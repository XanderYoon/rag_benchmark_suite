abstractive (generating new sentences). Hybrid approaches blend both techniques [13]. Summarization supports both OLTP- style and OLAP-style queries by condensing large text volumes into accessible gists. While extractive methods suffice for fact-based OLTP queries, OLAP-style queries, requiring synthesis across mul- tiple documents, benefit from recursive and hybrid summarization approaches. Advances in deep learning, particularly large language models (LLMs), have blurred the line between extractive and abstrac- tive summarization, enabling high-quality hierarchical summaries for complex QA tasks [21]. 2.1 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Despite improvements in handling long contexts, LLMs still struggle with efficiently processing extended text [22], making RAG essential for supplementing generation with retrieved context. Standard RAG retrieves text chunks from databases, optimized using strategies such as chunking [19], entity-based organization [11], and token- level granularity [18]. Retrieval methods range from classical BM25 [31] to supervised and heuristic-based ranking approaches [8, 28, 33, 48]. 2.2 Graph-based RAG Traditional retrieval methods rely on unstructured text, which lim- its their ability to capture complex relationships. Graph-enhanced RAG techniques address this by incorporating structured knowl- edge, improving interpretability and reasoning capabilities. Surveys such as Jin et al. [17] and Pan et al. [30] categorize LLM-graph inte- grations, distinguishing between text-attributed graphs and knowl- edge graphs (KGs). Recent approaches leverage graphs to optimize retrieval in various ways. MemWalker [5] organizes documents into a hierarchical tree and employs iterative prompting to navigate this structure for more efficient context retrieval. PEARL [38] decom- poses complex reasoning tasks into structured sequences of actions, such as identifying participants, summarizing conversations, and executing planned steps. ReadAgent [20] condenses documents into gists while maintaining a memory directory to facilitate recall of relevant details for task completion. Knowledge Graph Prompting (KGP) [43] structures documents as a graph and utilizes a traversal agent to retrieve passages that are most relevant to a
