into any RAG system that requires integrating information across documents to improve the accuracy of retrieval and response [28]. 3.2.1 Hierarchical Clustering and Summarization. TREX leverages RAPTOR [35] to first construct a hierarchical tree structure, T , from the text chunks 𝐷 using a hierarchical clustering algorithm, represented as T (𝐷). Each node in this tree is a summary of the child nodes below it. Given a corpus divided into𝑛 chunks, the tree will have𝑛 leaf nodes, each representing a text chunk(𝑐1, 𝑐2, . . . , 𝑐𝑛) [35]. At the first level, we apply a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to cluster text chunks into 𝑘 clusters. GMMs assume that data arise from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions [25]. Each text chunk 𝑥𝑖 is initially represented as a 𝑑-dimensional vector, de- rived from embeddings generated by the text-ada-embeddings-002 model [? ]. The likelihood that a chunk 𝑥𝑖 belongs to cluster 𝑘 is given by𝑃 (𝑥𝑖 |𝜃𝑘 ) = 1 (2𝜋 )𝑑/2 |Σ𝑘 |1/2 exp (︂ − 1 2 (𝑥𝑖 − 𝜇𝑘 )𝑇 Σ−1 𝑘 (𝑥𝑖 − 𝜇𝑘 ) )︂ , where Σ𝑘 and 𝜇𝑘 represent the covariance matrix and mean vec- tor of cluster 𝑘, respectively. The overall probability distribution for 𝑃 (𝑥) is then given by 𝑃 (𝑥) = ∑︁𝐾 𝑘=1 𝜋𝑘 𝑃 (𝑥 |𝜃𝑘 ), where 𝜋𝑘 is the weight for that 𝑘th cluster. The GMM model is then trained to maximize the likelihood of the data, 𝑃 (𝑥) [25, 35]. However, text embeddings from the text-ada-embeddings-002 model are high-dimensional (𝑑), which can introduce computational inefficiencies and noise. To address this, we apply Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) as done in [35] to reduce the dimensionality from 𝑑 to 𝑑′ [24]. These lower-dimensional representations (𝑑′-dimensional vectors) are then used as input to the GMM clustering process.
