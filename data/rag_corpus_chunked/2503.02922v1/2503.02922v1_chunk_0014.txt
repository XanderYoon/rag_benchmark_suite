synthesis across multiple articles [45]. To mitigate data leakage, we use the dev split (7,405 questions), filtering out queries directly answerable with- out any context by GPT-4, resulting in 5,491 benchmark questions. • MSMarco: A large-scale dataset of crowdsourced queries from Bing search logs [3]. It includes over a million queries with annotated, synthesized answers. We sample 1,000 ques- tions for benchmarking. • Microsoft Earnings Call Transcripts: A long-form QA bench- mark comprising 40 open-ended financial questions, split between Q4FY2024 transcripts (20 questions derived from a single earnings call) and cross-year corpus queries (20 questions derived from multiple transcripts). All questions demand comprehension and synthesis of earnings calls, whether it be a single or multiple transcripts, to produce multi-sentence answers, emphasizing comprehension over extractive fact retrieval [26]. • Kevin Scott Podcast Transcripts: A dataset from GraphRAG, containing 125 high-level questions derived from inter- views with tech leaders [12, 36]. Unlike standard multi-hop QA, this dataset focuses on multi-document summarization, requiring synthesis of overarching insights rather than re- trieval of granular facts. 4.2 Comparative RAG Strategies We benchmark TREX against GraphRAG, RAPTOR, and Azure AI Hybrid Search to assess retrieval and answer generation across OLTP and OLAP-style queries. GraphRAG constructs LLM-generated knowledge graphs to generate community summaries, while RAP- TOR organizes text into a hierarchical tree using recursive summa- rization. Since TREX integrates graph-based and vector-based RAG techniques, we also compare it against Azure AI Hybrid Search, a vector-based baseline leveraging both keyword and semantic similarity retrieval [28]. 4.2.1 GraphRAG. GraphRAG [12] retrieves context via two query- ing engines: • LocalSearch: Optimized for OLTP-style queries by allocat- ing context across entity descriptions, relationships, com- munity summaries, and raw text. Users can fine-tune allo- cation parameters [12]. • GlobalSearch: Optimized for OLAP-style queries using a map-reduce approach that selects and integrates relevant
