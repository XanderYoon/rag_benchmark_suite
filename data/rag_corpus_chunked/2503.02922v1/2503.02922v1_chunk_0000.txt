Traditional RAG methods often fall short in handling nu- anced, multi-document synthesis tasks. By structuring knowledge as graphs, we can facilitate the retrieval of context that captures greater semantic depth and enhances language model operations. We explore graph-based RAG methodologies and introduce TREX, a novel, cost-effective alternative that combines graph-based and vector-based retrieval techniques. Our benchmarking across four di- verse datasets highlights the strengths of different RAG methodolo- gies, demonstrates TREX’s ability to handle multiple open-domain QA types, and reveals the limitations of current evaluation methods. In a real-world technical support case study, we demonstrate how TREX solutions can surpass conventional vector-based RAG in efficiently synthesizing data from heterogeneous sources. Our find- ings underscore the potential of augmenting large language models with advanced retrieval and orchestration capabilities, advancing scalable, graph-based AI solutions. 1 INTRODUCTION Traditionally, knowledge workers—such as executives, managers, and analysts—relied on data warehousing and operational databases to make faster, more informed decisions [4]. Today, the range of decision support tools has expanded to include foundational mod- els, with AI software spending projected to reach $297.9 billion by 2027 [15]. Although the modern knowledge worker operates in
