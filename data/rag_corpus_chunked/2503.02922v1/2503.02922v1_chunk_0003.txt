the context lengths that models can process [10], the importance of precise context selection remains. Issues such as context stuffing [16], the “lost in the middle” phenomenon [22], and diminishing model performance with singular context persists [37]. While some models [40] achieve both high recall and precision, using such long-context modalities can be costly and slow, underscoring the ongoing need for careful selection of what information is included in the context. Building on these challenges, graph-based RAG solutions such as GraphRAG [12] have been developed to improve retrieval for OLAP-like queries by structuring and synthesizing information across multiple documents. Since graph-based RAG solutions are primarily designed for OLAP-style queries, subsequent advance- ments, including Sarmah et al. [34] and Cosmos AI Graph [9], have introduced query orchestrators to dynamically route questions to the appropriate RAG methodology, ensuring effective handling of all query types. However, misrouted queries [34] and the high cost of maintaining complex graph-based retrieval systems present sig- nificant limitations. To mitigate these issues, we introduce TREX (Truncated RAPTOR Expanded IndeX), a cost-effective alternative that eliminates the need for expensive orchestrators while reducing the overhead of full knowledge graph indexing [ 35]. This paper evaluates the strengths and limitations of advanced RAG method- ologies in open-domain QA and introduces TREX, a scalable ap- proach that balances semantic depth and computational efficiency. We benchmark TREX on four diverse datasets representative of enterprise-scale LLM applications to highlight scenarios where our method surpasses existing solutions. 1.1 Industry Trends With our diverse range of customer engagements across sectors such as manufacturing, healthcare, finance and telecommunica- tions, we have identified two distinct classes of queries that are of particular interest to our clients. These query types can be broadly categorized based on their question scope (e.g., local versus global) [12]: • Online Transaction Processing (OLTP):
