methods. Suitability for dynamic corpora. Training-based indexing struggles with dy- namic corpora, as training on new documents often causes forgetting of old ones [15]. Although several studies attempt to mitigate this issue [17,10,4,8], it remains inherent to training-based methods. Few-Shot GR alleviates this chal- lenge by enabling easy addition or removal of docids in the few-shot indexing docid bank, thus avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Future work can further ex- plore this direction. The datasets used in this paper, NQ320K and MS300K, contain corpora of 100K and 320K documents, respectively. So it is worthwhile to test whether Few- Shot GR’s effectiveness would generalise to a million-document corpus. Also, it is worth testing Few-Shot GR on other datasets (e.g., BEIR [32] and conversational search domains [24,22,23,19]). Finally, exploring automatic retrieval quality pre- diction for generative retrieval methods is another promising direction [21,20]. Generative Retrieval with Few-shot Indexing 7 References 1.
