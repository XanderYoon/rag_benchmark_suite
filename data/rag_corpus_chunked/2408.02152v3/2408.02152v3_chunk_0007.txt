and MS300K. The leading observation is that Few-Shot GR outperforms all baselines across all metrics, except Gen- RET/NOVO on Recall@10 (NQ320K)/MRR@10 (MS300K). This shows that our proposed few-shot indexing is highly effective versus training-based indexing. Notably, while GenRET/NOVO is slightly better on those metrics, it requires large training corpora and heavy model-specific training, which may not be fea- sible in low-resource settings. In contrast, Few-Shot GR achieves strong results using only a small set of examples, making it more practical. The impact of # docids generated per document. Figure 2 shows Few- Shot GR’s performance w.r.t. # generated docids per document during few- shot indexing on NQ320K; we equip Few-Shot GR with llama-3-8B-Instruct or Zephyr-7B-β[33]. We found that Few-Shot GR’s performance improves as it generates more docids per document during indexing, reaching saturation when generating 10 docids. E.g., with Llama-3, increasing the number of generated docids from 1 to 10 yields a 27.2% improvement in Recall@10. It suggests that our devised “one-to-many mapping” is key to the success of few-shot indexing. The trend is similar on MS300K; we report only NQ320K hereafter due to space. The impact of LLMs choices. Table 2 shows Few-Shot GR’s performance using different LLMs on NQ320K; here we compare T5-base, Zephyr-7B-β, and 6 Askari et al. Table 3: Efficiency of indexing and retrieval for Few-Shot GR and training-based GR baselines on NQ320K. Few-Shot GR uses llama-3-8B-Instruct and generates 10 docids per document during few-shot indexing.

However, both markedly outperform T5-base in terms of performance. It suggests that selecting an effective LLM is another critical factor contributing to the success of Few-Shot GR.
