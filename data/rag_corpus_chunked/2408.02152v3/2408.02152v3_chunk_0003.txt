tribute to the success of Few-Shot GR: conducting one-to-many mapping during few-shot indexing, and selecting an effective LLM. Finally, we demonstrate that few-shot indexing is significantly more efficient than training-based indexing. Our main contributions are as follows: –We propose Few-Shot GR, a novel GR framework, which conducts GR index- ing solely with prompting an LLM without requiring any training. –We devise few-shot indexing with one-to-many mapping to further enhance Few-Shot GR’s performance. –Experiments show that Few-Shot GR achieves superior performance to state- of-the-art GR methods that require heavy training. Generative Retrieval with Few-shot Indexing 3 Example1 Query:Provide list of the olympic games? Identifier:olympic-games-list Example3 Query:How does photosynthesis work in plants?

Identifier:subsidiary-corporation-parent Example4 Query:{new query} Identifier: Fig.1: Prompt used for indexing and retrieval. The three queries in the demon- stration examples are sampled from NQ’s training set [12], while their corre- sponding docids are annotated by the authors. 2 Methodology Few-shotindexingwithone-to-manymapping.LetC={d 1,· · ·,d i,· · ·, d |C|} be a corpus with|C|documents; this step aims to use an LLM to generatendis- tinct free-text docids{id 1,· · ·, id j,· · ·, id n}for each documentdin the corpus C. Ultimately, we create adocid bankBthat contains docids for all documents (ndocids for each document) inC. Following the GR literature [37,27], which shows that replacing documents with their corresponding pseudo queries during indexing results in better re- trieval quality, we use only pseudo queries for indexing. Specifically, we first generatenpseudo queries{ˆq 1,· · ·,ˆq j,· · ·,ˆq n}for a documentd i and only feed the generated pseudo queries to the LLM to generatencorresponding docids {id1,· · ·, id j,· · ·, id n}, formally: ˆqj =QG(di), idj =LLM(ˆqj), (1) whereQGis a pseudo query generator,i= 1,· · ·,|C|andj= 1,· · ·, n.
