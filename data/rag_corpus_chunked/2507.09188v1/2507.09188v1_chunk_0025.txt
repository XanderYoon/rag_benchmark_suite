HA 0.4930 0.3580 0.4250 E Comparison of Retrieval Results between Latent Representation Query and Profile Query To examine the differences between the latent representation query and the profile query, we sampled a set of user-item pairs and calculated the pairwise similarity among the reviews retrieved by each query type. The results are shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5. As observed, the reviews retrieved by the latent representation query exhibit lower similarity compared to those retrieved by the profile query, indicating that the former leads to more diverse retrievals. In contrast, the profile query yields more semantically concentrated results, better aligning with long-term user and item preferences. 13 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 Heatmap of Latent Representation Query 0.92 0.94 0.96 0.98 1.00 Figure 4: Similarity of each reviews retrieved by latent representation query. 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 Heatmap of Profile Query 0.84 0.86 0.88 0.90 0.92 0.94 0.96 0.98 1.00 Figure 5: Similarity of each reviews retrieved by profile query. F Prompt Template Fig. 6 demonstrates how LLMs generate item profiles on Yelp by combining item metadata and user reviews. This enables the model to identify key user characteristics associated with the item, offering deeper insights into user preferences and improving the understanding of user-item interactions. System prompt: You will serve as an assistant to help me summarize which types of users would enjoy a specific business. I will provide you with the basic information (name) of that business and also some reviews from users for it. Here are the instructions: 1. The basic information will be described in JSON format, with the following attributes: { "name": "the name of the business" } 2. Reviews from
