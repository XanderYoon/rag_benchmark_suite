step. In this scenarios, fine-tuning the embedding model is necessary. We designed a contrastive learning approach that minimizes the distance between the user ui and item vj profiles pui,vj and their corresponding opinions ˆrui,vj , while increasing the distance from irrelevant opinions. Lcontrastive = esim(pui ,vj ,ˆrui ,vj )/τ esim(pui ,vj ,ˆrui ,vj )/τ + P (i′,j′)̸=(i,j) esim(pui′ ,vj′ ,ˆrui′ ,vj′ )/τ . (9) where sim(·, ·) indicates cosine similarity, pu,v and ru,v denote embeddings of profiles and sum- marized reviews of the user-item pair, respectively. The embeddingpu,v and ru,v are computed as follows: pu,v = f ′(pu,v), ru,v = f ′(ˆru,v). (10) where f ′ denotes fine-tuned embedding model. pu,v and ˆru,v denote the profile and summarized reviews of user-item pair (u, v). 2.4 Recommendation Explanation Generation For a target user-item interaction, we concatenate the corresponding constructed user and item profiles (Sec. 2.2), the extracted user and item embeddings (Sec. 2.1) and the relevant reviews for data augmentation (Sec. 2.3) and use the prompt template shown in Fig. 8 to instruct LLM to generate the recommendation explanation. 3 Experiments 3.1 Experimental Settings 3.1.1 Datasets We conduct experiments on three public datasets from different domains: Yelp1, Amazon-books2, and Google-reviews [16, 17]. More details of datasets can be found in Tab. 3 in Appendix A. 3.1.2 Evaluation Metrics For evaluating the semantic explainability and stability of the generated explanation, we follow XRec [11] and G-Refer [12] to employ a suite of metrics that assessing the semantic explainability and stability of generated explanations. Concretely, we use GPTscore [18], BERTPrecision score ,BERTRecall score and BERTF1 score [19] to measure the explainability. To evaluate the consistency, we also report the standard deviations of these metrics. The details of metric can be found in Appendix B. 1https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge 2https://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/ 6 Table 1: Overall performance. Superscrips “P”,
