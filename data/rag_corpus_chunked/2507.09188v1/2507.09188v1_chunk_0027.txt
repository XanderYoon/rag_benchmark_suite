in Fig. 8, combining multiple data components such as retrieved reviews, user/item embeddings, and user/item metadata. The prompt is tokenized and transformed into an embedding space representation. To distinguish special tokens within the prompt as distinct entities, we integrate them into the LLM’s tokenizer. These tokens are subsequently replaced with their corresponding modified embeddings in the final token embedding representation. 14 System prompt: You will serve as an assistant to help me determine which types of business a specific user is likely to enjoy. I will provide you with information about businesses that the user has interacted with, including their reviews of those businesses. Here are the instructions: 1. Each interacted business will be described in DICTIONARY format, with the following attributes: { "title": "the name of the business", (if there is no business, I will set this value to "None") "description": "a description of what types of users will like this business", "reviews": "the user's review on the business" (if there is no review, I will set this value to "None") } 2. The information I will give you: PURCHASED BUSINESSES: a list of dictionaries describing the businesses that the user has interacted with. Requirements: 1. Please provide your answer in JSON format, following this structure: { "summarization": "A summarization of what types of business this user is likely to enjoy." (if you are unable to summarize it, please set this value to "None") } 2. Please ensure that the "summarization" is no longer than 50 words. 3. Do not provide any other text outside the JSON string. Output: { "summarization": "This user enjoys ... experiences, ... service, ... atmospheres." } Figure 7: Prompt for User Profile System prompt: Explain why the user would buy with the book within 50 words.
