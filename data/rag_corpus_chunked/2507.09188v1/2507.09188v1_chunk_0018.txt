For the retrieval module, we have not yet implemented deeper post-processing of retrieved reviews, including re-ranking the review list and capturing key information. 6 Conclusion We analyze the limitations of existing explainable recommendation methods in terms of profile generation and retrieval efficiency, and propose REXHA to address these challenges. The key components of REXHA include a hierarchical aggregation module that generates comprehensive yet concise user/item profiles, and two different query construction strategies that capture both global and fine-grained features of users and items to retrieve relevant reviews. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of REXHA, highlighting its promising potential for real-world applications. Future work will focus on deeper utilization of the retrieved reviews and accelerating the profile generation process. 9 References [1] Al Borchers, Jonathan L. Herlocker, and John Riedl.
