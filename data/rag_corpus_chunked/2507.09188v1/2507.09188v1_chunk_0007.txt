constructing an item profile, we use this item’s reviews as raw reviews. As shown in Fig. 1, the first step is to aggregate reviews of two adjacent sibling nodes and use LLM to summarize the two raw reviews. The primary motivation for employing LLM to summarize raw item reviews lies in addressing two critical challenges: excessive information redundancy and semantic ambiguity. By condensing user feedback into summaries, this approach establishes a robust semantic foundation that enhances the later hierarchical aggregation process. Raw review data often suffers from verbosity, noise, and conflicting signals, such as redundant feature mentions (e.g., “camera quality”), irrelevant details, or contradictory sentiments (“loves the design but hates the price”). Directly aggregating unprocessed text risks diluting actionable insights or introducing logical inconsistencies, which undermines both analytical precision and contextual coherence. LLM excels at distilling these noisy inputs into concise, semantically dense representations. This process not only overcomes the limitation of context length but also extracts nuanced user preferences (e.g., “prioritizes camera performance over battery life”) and item characteristics (e.g., “high-resolution sensor with limited battery capacity”). The resulting summaries act as high-fidelity intermediaries, filtering out extraneous details while preserving critical semantic relationships. 4 Based on the above motivation, we design the instruction prompt to order the LLM to preliminarily summarize each raw reviews. The prompt can be found in Appendix F. By combining the instruction prompt with a raw review ri as the input to LLM, we can leverage LLM to generate review summa- rization and similar processes are conducted in parallel for raw reviews. This is similar to a k-ary-tree merging operation, where one raw review takes part in only one summarization. Assume there are m raw reviews at the bottom level. Then, after raw review summarization, there are m/k brief but more information-dense summaries and they will
