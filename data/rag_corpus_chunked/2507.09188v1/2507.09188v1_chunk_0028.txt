G Case Study We present two cases in Tab. 5 and Tab. 6 to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and illustrate how hierarchical aggregation based profile and retrieved reviews benefit the generated explanations. The table only shows some of the reviews on the retrieved content. We also provide the ground truth explanations and explanations generated by XRec [11] and G-Refer [12] for comparison. From Tab. 5, we can observe that our method hierarchically aggregates the item profile to highlight “high quality seafood and steak” and “good ambiance”. This allows our model to integrate the item profile and the retrieved related reviews to generate an explanation that covers both explicit and inferred preferences. In contrast, XRec incorrectly explains that the restaurant atmosphere is not as good as expected, failing to capture true interests, while G-Refer’s explanation is too general, focusing only on common aspects such as "food service" without touching on users’ preferences for specific food or atmosphere. This illustrates that the profile generated by aggregated reviews captures richer and more accurate personalized information than
