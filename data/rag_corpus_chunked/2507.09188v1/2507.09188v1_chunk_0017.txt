methods (e.g., NRT [ 6], PETER [ 8], SEQUER [ 24]) produce explanations word-by-word from user/item representations. Extraction-based methods (e.g., ESCOFILT [ 9], GREENer [ 7]) select sentences directly from reviews. Hybrid methods (e.g., ERRA [25], ExBERT [26]) integrate both paradigms using retrieval-augmented generation. With the advent of LLMs, recent works utilize their world knowledge for more fluent and informative explanations. PEPLER applies prompt learning [22]; POD adopts prompt distillation [ 27]; XRec integrates collaborative signals via a lightweight adaptor [11]; and G-Refer enhances explanation quality by retrieving structured and semantic CF signals [12]. 4.2 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances generative models by incorporating external information through retrieval. Recent research focuses on improving retrievers, generators, and their interaction. Recent RAG methods enhance LLMs by retrieving relevant knowledge and incorporating it into the input. A common approach is to concatenate retrieved documents with the original prompt. For example, In-Context RALM [28] appends retrieved content without modifying LLM parameters. SKR [29] lets the LLM choose between internal knowledge and retrieval. HyDE [ 30] generates a hypothetical answer to improve retrieval relevance. RichRAG [31] retrieves from multiple aspects and fuses the results for richer input. 5 Limitations Although REXHA achieves significant improvements in explanation quality and retrieval efficiency, it still has some limitations. For HA module, the time overhead is relatively high, requiring further optimizations such as dynamic pruning of the hierarchical structure based on different user-item pairs to reduce noise. For the retrieval module, we have not yet implemented deeper post-processing of retrieved reviews, including re-ranking the review list and capturing key information. 6 Conclusion We analyze the limitations of existing explainable recommendation methods in terms of profile generation and retrieval efficiency, and propose REXHA to address these challenges. The key components of REXHA include a hierarchical aggregation module that
