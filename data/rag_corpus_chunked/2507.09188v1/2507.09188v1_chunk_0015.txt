However, it performs slightly worse in terms of BERT scores. 3.3 Ablation Study We provide the ablation study in Tab. 2. It is observed that the hierarchical aggregation module improves the performance, which proves that the profile generated by this module exactly extracts the important information from user/item reviews, benefiting the generation step. Rarely using review retrieval module without the hierarchical aggregation module get the worst results. However, when two modules are combined, the best results are obtained. This observation indicates that the deviation of profiles introduces noise and makes LLM confused when faced with the contradiction between the profile and the retrieved reviews. In contrast, with the combination of the two modules, LLM can better utilize the retrieved reviews according to correct profiles. By integrating these two modules, we achieve a compounded benefit that exceeds what each could offer alone. 3.4 Analysis of Hyperparameter Sensitivity We further investigate how the performance ofREXHA varies with the number of retrieved reviews p. Fig. 2 illustrates the impact of increasing p from 2 to 15 on BERTprecision score and BERTrecall score . We can observe that on both Yelp, BERTprecision score consistently increases as p grows. When p > 4, BERTPrecision Score keeps increases on Google-reviews. When p = 8 REXHA achieves best perfor- mance on Amazon-books. We notice that BERTrecall score remains relatively insensitive to changes of p, indicating that the profile already contains the essential information required for explanation generation. 3.5 Analysis of Retrieval Efficiency We evaluate the preprocessing time required byREXHA
