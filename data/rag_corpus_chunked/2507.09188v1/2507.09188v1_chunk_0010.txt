REXHA encodes all raw reviews of the target user and item using the embedding model f (semantic encoder) and then aggregates all the encoded representations as 5 the latent query for the target user-item interaction: ˆru i = f (ru i ), ˆrv j = f (rv j ), (4) ˆRu = {ˆru 1 , ˆru 2 , . . . ,ˆru n}, ˆRv = {ˆrv 1 , ˆrv 2 , . . . ,ˆrv n}, (5) Qu = f ( ˆRu), Qv = f ( ˆRv), (6) qu = 1 N X qu i ∈Qu qu i , qv = 1 N X qv i ∈Qv qv i , (7) qlatent = qu + qv 2 . (8) where ru i is the raw review text written by the user, and ˆru i denotes its corresponding summarized opinion. Let ˆRu be the set of all user opinions ˆru. After mapping ˆRu to higher-dimension space by embedding model f, we obtain Qu, the set of embedding qu. N denotes the number of opinions. The same applies to the item side. Profile Query Since user and item profiles constructed in Sec. 2.2 contain precise and comprehen- sive information of user preferences and item characteristics, we design the profile query that directly uses the textual descriptions in profiles of the target user/item as the retrieval query. Because user/item profiles misalign with raw review summaries due to filtering information during the hierarchical aggregation step. In this scenarios, fine-tuning the embedding model is necessary. We designed a contrastive learning approach that minimizes the distance between the user ui and item vj profiles pui,vj and their corresponding opinions ˆrui,vj , while increasing the distance from irrelevant opinions. Lcontrastive = esim(pui ,vj ,ˆrui ,vj )/τ esim(pui ,vj ,ˆrui ,vj )/τ + P (i′,j′)̸=(i,j) esim(pui′ ,vj′ ,ˆrui′
