me summarize which types of users would enjoy a specific business. I will provide you with the basic information (name) of that business and also some reviews from users for it. Here are the instructions: 1. The basic information will be described in JSON format, with the following attributes: { "name": "the name of the business" } 2. Reviews from users will be managed in the following List format: [ "the first review", "the second review", .... ] 3. The information I will give you: BASIC INFORMATION: a JSON string describing the basic information about the business. USER REVIEWS: a List object containing some reviews from users about the business. Requirements: 1. Please provide your answer in JSON format, following this structure: { "summarization": "A summarization of what types of users would enjoy this business." (if you are unable to summarize it, please set this value to "None") } 2. Please ensure that the "summarization" is no longer than 50 words. 3. Do not provide any other text outside the JSON string. Output: { "summarization": "Users who appreciate ... would enjoy this business." } Figure 6: Prompt for Item Profile Fig. 7 presents a method for generating user profiles on the Yelp dataset using LLMs. By combining various item metadata, description (i.e., generated item profiles) and user reviews, the system builds detailed user profiles that capture preferences and support personalized recommendations. The generation process employs a structured prompt, as illustrated in Fig. 8, combining multiple data components such as retrieved reviews, user/item embeddings, and user/item metadata. The prompt is tokenized and transformed into an embedding space representation. To distinguish special tokens within the prompt as distinct entities, we integrate them into the LLM’s tokenizer. These tokens are subsequently replaced with their corresponding modified embeddings in the final token embedding representation.
