Unlike document and passage retrieval where the documents are generally longer than the queries, in response retrieval for dialogues the qu eries (dialogue contexts) tend to be longer than the documents (responses). A second important diﬀerence is the structure induced by the dialogue as seen in Table 1. Table 1. Comparison between passage retrieval and response retriev al for dialogues. In §3 we deﬁne the task of First-stage Retrieval for Dialogues . Colors symbolize the information-seeker and information-provider. p+/r+ are the relevant passage/response. Passage Retrieval First-stage Retrieval for Dialogues Input Query q Dialogue context U = {u1, u2, ..., uτ } Example q: what is theraderm used for u1: I want a ﬁrewall that will protect me but more of that to monitor any connection in or out of my mac [...] u2: {url} allows you to map joypad buttons to keyboard keys and [...] u3: Do the diagonals for the analog stick work correctly for you? [...] Output Ranked list of passages Ranked list of responses Example p+: Thera-Derm Lotion is used as a moisturizer to treat or prevent dry, rough, scaly, [...] r+: In the ”Others” tab, try [...] Given the diﬀerences between the domains, we verify empirically acro ss three information-seeking datasets and 1.7M queries, the generalizability of ﬁve ﬁnd- ings ( F1 to F5) from the passage and document retrieval literature related to state-of-the-art sparse and dense retrieval models. We are mo tivated in our se- lection of these ﬁve ﬁndings by their impact in prior works (cf. §2). Our results show that four out of ﬁve previous ﬁndings do indeed generalize to o ur domain: 2 While for most benchmarks [52] we have only 10–100 candi- dates, a working system with the Reddit data from PolyAI https://github.com/PolyAI-LDN/conversational-datasets would need to retrieve from 3.7 billion responses.
