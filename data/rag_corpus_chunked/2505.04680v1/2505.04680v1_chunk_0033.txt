Score ~ Pipeline * Collection * Type of qQestion + BERTScore F1 + (Question id | 1))  with a base one (i.e., Human Score ~ BERTScore F1 + (question | 1)). 20 Under the hypothesis that this is a fully crossed design where all “subjects” experience all 60 conditions. The model structure accounts for the factorial design in the fixed effects, similar to ANOVA, while also incorporating random effects to handle variation due to sampling or other sources of non -independence. LMMs offer several advantages over ANOVA, including better handling of unbalanced designs, the ability to model both categor ical and continuous predictors, more flexible error structures, and improved handling of missing data. 4.5.3 Manual usability checks on HR, VHT and AMR datasets The usability checks are performed to qualitatively evaluate the performance of the system from the domain expert point of view and provide feedback on how useful LLMs could be in the day-to-day work of colleague working on science for policy support. This evaluation is meant to provide some insights into the quality of the answers, as well as identify potential issues and hints to be considered when using similar tools and during further developments. The usability checks are run on the three collections RP, VHT and AMR described previously respectively in Section 4.4.2, 4.4.3 and 4.4.4. To prepare the questions, we initially planned to follow the approach in [55], resulting in the creation of four types of collections, detailed in Table 2 - types of collections. Table 2 - types of collections TYPE Description Relevant Collections containing only documents relevant to the topic Some noise Collections containing some documents that are not relevant or related to the topic Noise only Collections containing just noise, that is, none of the documents contain information relevant to the topic
