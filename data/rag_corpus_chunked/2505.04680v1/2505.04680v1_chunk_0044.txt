that divides all documents into chunks and scans them before preparing the answer is slower than previous versions. The reason can be that the collection contains many documents, some of which are relatively long reviews. Furthermore, the SHy pipeline 27 provides, for each answer, a larger list of references that expected; even in the case of very specific questions for which the answer is present in a single document of the collection, so it seems that it could provide false relevant references. The overall results of the usability test for the 19 questions show:  9 of 15 answers have scores of 5 –4 and are considered as correct (completed or missing just minor information),  3 of 15 have scores 2 -3 that is “the answer is correct but focuses on minor information or is missing important information” or “the information is misinterpreted” and,  3 of 15 have scores of 0 -1, that is "the general topic i s understood, but not the scope of the question", or “No answer or incorrect answer”,  Four questions were referred to tables and therefore removed from the analysis and evaluation. The complete evaluation, including question type, score and comments justifying the score, is provided online as described in Section 4.5.3. One correct and complete answer, one correct but providing wrong references and one less correct answer are given as examples just below.
