the users to interact and work with different Large Language Models, such as the commercial OpenAI GPT family models (currently: GPT 3.5, GPT 3.5 large, GPT 4, GPT 4 32k, GPT4 Turbo), and some powerful open source models (such as: Nous Hermes Mixtral, Llama 3 70B chat, MistralOrca 7b, Zephyr beta 7b15). Our proposed system, RAGEv, could be used to further evaluate for factuality and trustworthiness the RAG functionalities supported by GPT@JRC, including the possibility to use PDF and Word documents in chats, and the integration of GPT@JRC with internal bodies of knowledge and tools. 14 https://vast.jrc.ec.europa.eu 15 as accessed on 1/7/2024 14 4.3.1 Retrieval pipelines Several pipelines were developed to check the performance of different approaches on retrieval results: Table 1 - Retrieval pipelines tested Pipeline Description Vanilla A vanilla LLM is a basic, unmodified version of a large language model. It is trained on a large corpus of text and can generate human -like text based on the input it is given. However, it does not have any additional features or modifications that might be used to improve its performance or adapt it to specific tasks. Vector Search Vector Search uses vectors to represent and efficiently search through complex, unstructured data. It represents data points as vector s in a high -dimensional space, where each dimension defines a specific attribute or feature. The search compares the similarity of the query vector to the possible vector paths that traverse all of the dimensions. Full-text Search Full-text search ref ers to techniques for searching a single computer -stored document or a collection in a full -text database. In a full-text search, a search engine examines all of the words in every stored document as it tries to match search criteria (for example, text specified by a user). It is distinguished
