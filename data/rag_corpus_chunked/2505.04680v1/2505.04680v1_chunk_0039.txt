mi ss some information (that might be highly relevant), if the question is very specific it might miss information that can change the meaning of the answer. To this end, the SHy pipeline was developed, which explicitly interrogates all documents and returns much more additional context, to deal with 25 used cases where it is important to extract all relevant information and not only the top 3 or 5 parts. The answers are consistent: if the exact same question is repeated, the system provides the same answer, but the wording of the questions determines the quality of the answer. It is crucial, thus, to formulate the questions with the correct wording for the system. Description of the issues identified during usability testing  The text -chunk reported as references, might include parts not mentioned in answers.  There is learning curve to use LLMs in a correct way: on the one hand some users were surprised that questions formulated in the same chats would re -use the context of the previous answers, and als o sometimes the way the question was worded (prompting) would impact substantially the quality of the provided answer, or even cause the system to find no answer.  Still some problems when asking general questions as all the right references are not always found.  Sometimes it does not prioritise the relevance of text in different sections of the documents For review papers it mixes the content of the review papers with the conclusions of the review itself. The complete evaluation, including question type, score and comments justifying the score, is provided online under as explained in Section 4.5.3. One correct and complete answer and one correct but incomplete answer are given as examples just below. Question: is further research needed to reveal the mechanisms of
