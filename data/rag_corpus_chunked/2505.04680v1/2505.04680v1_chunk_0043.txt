consider climate change, land use and cost-efficiency throughout the entire process to implement upstream or downstream responses to tackle plastic pollution. mentions to earthworms should be present as there ia a full paper on the potential use of earthworms against microplastics Comments: good answer, as it gets most of the importan points, but it misses some of the important conclusions Score: 3 5.2.3 Virtual Human Twin (VHT): During the development, the system was evaluated in the capability to identify the correct chunks extracted as relevant from the collection. For this, an Excel table containing the identified as relevant chunks and its associated publications were compared with the desired answer, or ground truth. As expected for this type of systems, the results showed that the completeness of the answer are not necessarily achieved because not all relevant chunks in each document are identified in the process. It is important to indicate that the size of the answer is also a factor to consider, if the answer is complex and long, the chunks cannot contain the complete answer, therefore the answer is incomplete. Furthermore , it has been observed that the system preferably takes the answer from the abstract if found there, therefore it prioritises the text. Some chunks from the first page contain also parts of the citation and authors information. No main differences were fo und when evaluating the performance of answering numeric questions, versus verbal questions. The SHy pipeline that divides all documents into chunks and scans them before preparing the answer is slower than previous versions. The reason can be that the collection contains many documents, some of which are relatively long reviews. Furthermore, the SHy pipeline 27 provides, for each answer, a larger list of references that expected; even in the case of very specific questions for
