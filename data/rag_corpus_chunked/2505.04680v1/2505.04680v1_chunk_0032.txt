verify that our data meets the ANOVA assumptions: normality of residuals, homogeneity of variances, and independence of observations. Then we use pandas and penguin statistical packages in python to calculate the main effects for each factor, two-way interactions, three-way interactions, and the four-way interaction. For the interpretation of the results, we focus on the F -values and p -values for each main effect and interaction. Significant main effects indicate that the factor levels differ in their effect on the dependent variable, while significant interactions suggest that the effect of one factor depends on the levels of another factor. If significant main effects or interactions are found, we conduct post-hoc tests, such as Tukey's HSD, to determine which specific levels or combinations differ significantly. Additionally, we calculate effect sizes (e.g., partial eta - squared) to help understand the magnitude of significant effects. Given the complexity of a four -way ANOVA, we have to ensure that we have an adequate sample size for each cell in the design and we want to conduct a power analysis to ensure the study has sufficient power to detect effects. If certain higher -order interactions are not significant or theoretically meaningful, we might consider simplifying the model. As a second option, we used Linear mixed models (LMMs), as they offer a robust alternative to ANOVA for analysing factorial experiments, particularly when dealing with complex designs or unbalanced data. We will compare the two models:  Human Score ~ Pipeline * Collection * Type of qQestion + BERTScore F1 + (Question id | 1))  with a base one (i.e., Human Score ~ BERTScore F1 + (question | 1)). 20 Under the hypothesis that this is a fully crossed design where all “subjects” experience all 60 conditions. The model structure accounts for the factorial design in the
