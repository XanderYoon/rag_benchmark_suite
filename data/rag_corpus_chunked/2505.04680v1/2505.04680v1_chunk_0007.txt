In recent years, they have shown impressive results on a plethora of tasks [2] and they have become the model of choice in the natural language processing (NLP). Current LMs have evolved from statistical approaches that use deterministic methods to represent language as a probability distribution. For example, unigram LM modelled language as the probability of encountering a single word, like "dog", given a large set of training data, such as Wikipedia. Current state -of-the-art LMs are based on the Transformer neural architecture [5], the main component of which is the self-attention mechanism [6]. In simple terms, the attention mechanism allows
