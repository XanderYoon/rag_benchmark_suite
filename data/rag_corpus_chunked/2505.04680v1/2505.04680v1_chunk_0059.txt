user queries using medical ontologies a nd knowledge bases such as UMLS (Unified Medical Language System) or SNOMED CT. This will help bridge the gap between user queries and the technical language used in scientific papers. Second, write specialized models for processing information specificall y from tables and figures as the general approach of pushing everything in the model’s context does not give consistent results. Third, more advanced quantification metrics should be added to the evaluation of the pair “pipeline x collection of documents” namely, the “FactScore” [57] that provides an overall view of how well supported each of the statements are and the very recent semantic entropy based hallucination detection [58]. We believe the same approach towards factuality used here for text would be of great use for other types of health data such as medical imaging, and omics and thus that this would be the first of several technical reports focused on factuality of AI for Health in different scenarios. 36 7 Bibliography [1] L.
