drivers and barriers. Of the 2,000 documents identified in Scopus Database, responding to the specific search string 25, 10 documents related to the subtopic “Main constrains for the implementation of digital twin in health care” were selected and uploaded as a collection for further evaluation with RAGEv. For this, 18 questions ranging from very general questions, that is covering multiple documents, to very specific ones, together with the ground truth answer, were prepared. 4.4.4 Bacteriophages (AMR) This collection covers a topic well stablished and mature in the scientific health domain. Phage therapy consists of administering viruses, called phages or bacteriophages, as medicine to kill pathogenic bacteria in case of severe bacterial infection, especially when other antimicrobial drugs are not efficient. They are very specific and not harmful to humans since they only infect bacteria. They are used in human patients but also in livestock and companio n animals. However, phage therapeutic products are not yet authorised on the market. There are currently no sufficient evidence -based clinical protocols, no complete dedicated regulatory framework and it is still necessary to investigate the impact of phag es on the environment before implementing phage therapy on a large scale. In this context, RAGEv was tested in its capacity to help gathering information, highlighting key factors and knowledge gaps. Eight reviews were manually selected from the 15 reviews identified in the Scopus Database, responding to the specific search 26; 8 were manually selected for testing RAGEv. For this selected set, 8 question s, addressing different types of information, such as numerical values, open questions, more specific questions, contained in a table, in a figure, or in section titles, together with the ground truth answer, were prepared. 4.5 Experiments To ensure the efficacy and reliability of RAGEv, we run first a set of experiments on
