the scientific output of research project s. The EU is successfully funding research and innovation projects via its dedicated Framework programme, which generate an impressive amount of knowledge and data, accessible via CORDIS22. SOPLAS23, a project on Macro and Microplastic in Agricultural Soil Systems, was chosen to test the performance of the RAGEv pipelines with unrelated documentation. SOPLAS reports 3 scientific papers and 2 additional documents, one of which with potentially side-tracking content (not related to microplastics, but on communication of results). For this, 10 questions ranging from very general questions, that is covering multi ple documents, to very specific ones together with the ground truth answer , were prepared. The questions, 21 https://pubmedqa.github.io/ 22 https://cordis.europa.eu/ - EU repository information about EU Research & Development projects 23 SOPLAS, a project on Macro and Microplastic 17 based on the answer provided by the system, were adapted in the different phases on the test. 4.4.3 Virtual Human Twins (VHT) This collection focus es on a relatively new scientific health topic, having non-homogeneous information coverage, that is redundant information related to barriers, but much less on specific applications. A virtual human twin (VHT) is a digital representation of different levels of human anatomy (e.g. cells, tissues, organs, or organ systems) for modelling the state of human health or disease state 24. RAGEv was tested for its performance when investigating the state of the art of research in the topic, as well as its drivers and barriers. Of the 2,000 documents identified in Scopus Database, responding to the specific search string 25, 10 documents related to the subtopic “Main constrains for the implementation of digital twin in health care” were selected and uploaded as a collection for further evaluation with RAGEv. For this, 18 questions ranging from very general questions, that is covering multiple
