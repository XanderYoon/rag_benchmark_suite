gathering general information on a subject, saving time in the initial literatu re research phase. While not offering an exhaustive analysis of pros and cons, it would provide users with foundational notions that can be further refined through reading the referenced papers. Additionally, the system would facilitate specific answer searches and swift identification of references within a defined document collection. It is worth noting that information retrieval would be limited to text content, excluding figures, graphs, tables, and subtitles, as these elements are beyond the system's analytical capabilities at the moment. Lastly, the system would offer document content summaries, which, although not comprehensive, would present a general idea of the material's content. This approach allows users to efficiently grasp key concepts and dec ide which documents warrant further in-depth study. As a conclusion, LLMs facilitate the identification of certain information but m ore efforts are required to ensure that the answers are fully complete and corrects for all the use cases and final verification by the domain expert of each of the statements provided is always needed. Finally, a manual of instructions would be highly useful for the user, as it is not always intuitive what wording/prompting would improve the performance of the system. 6.2 Future works Among the many potential future directions, we think that the functionalities that will add more value would be the following. First, to implement a query processing module that can 35 interpret and expand user queries using medical ontologies a nd knowledge bases such as UMLS (Unified Medical Language System) or SNOMED CT. This will help bridge the gap between user queries and the technical language used in scientific papers. Second, write specialized models for processing information specificall y from tables and figures as the general approach of pushing everything in the model’s context
