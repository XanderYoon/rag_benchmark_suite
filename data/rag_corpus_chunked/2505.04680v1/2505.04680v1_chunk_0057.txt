layers of llama3, which gave very poor results. Different retrieval systems might be needed, depending on the type of the questions. We noticed very early that a combination of full -text and vector search was the best for general questions. However, more specific use cases, such as when the user wants to do a literature review or need to extract very detailed information, a novel type of pipeline, called SHy was getting better results because it was returning relevant context from each o f the papers, instead of the top-k relevant ones. A user-friendly interface that allows for intuitive querying and efficient navigation of search results is very important and very high in our users’ wish list. It should also i nclude features like faceted search, filters for publication date and study type, and the ability to explore related papers and citations linked to each of the sentences generated by the LLM. 6.1.2 On the usability RAGEv can facilitate quick search of information on a specific fixed collection. However, the answers need to be verified afterwards due to three main aspects: the answers are not exhaustive; not all the references provided are used to build the answer and there are a number of irrelevant pieces of text among the references. The proposed system aims to provide a rapid overview of a topic from a collection of papers, such as those assembled using Scopus. This feature would be valuable for quickly gathering general information on a subject, saving time in the initial literatu re research phase. While not offering an exhaustive analysis of pros and cons, it would provide users with foundational notions that can be further refined through reading the referenced papers. Additionally, the system would facilitate specific answer searches and swift identification of references within a defined document collection.
