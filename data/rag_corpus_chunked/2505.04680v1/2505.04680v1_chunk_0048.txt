starts discussing about technologies that is not the scope of the question. Despite the answer is in 1 reference, it provides you 5 additional references that are not related (maybe the reason for adding information on technologies that was not the scope of the question) Score: 2 Considering that RAGEv is not intended to provide exhaustive answers but representative of the information existing in each collection of documents, two replies to the same question will not be necessarily identical but will not contradict each other. In addition, the answer will depend on the collection used, therefore the answer has an intrinsic bias due to the selection of documents uploaded for the analysis. Finally, prompting is cruc ial to frame the answer. Even though, several issues were identified when checking the system for the collection. Description of the observations and issues identified during usability testing in the testing environment  Verification of the maximum numb er of pages/documents that can be processed without making the system very slow.  Since only a defined number of so -called “relevant chunks” are used to build the answer, but not all, by default the answers cannot be exhaustive nor completed.  Since the an swer is not exhaustive, contrafactual information is not necessary provided.  Specifically, the SHy pipeline provides too many references (not always related).  For more conceptual questions or general questions, it is difficult to understand how representative is the answer in the collection. Therefore, it will be of an added value to understand how many documents in the collection support each statement of the answer. 29 Nevertheless, the role of the prompting is fundamental and defines the quality of the answers.
