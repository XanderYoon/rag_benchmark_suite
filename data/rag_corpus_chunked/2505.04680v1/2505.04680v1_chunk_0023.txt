all of the dimensions. Full-text Search Full-text search ref ers to techniques for searching a single computer -stored document or a collection in a full -text database. In a full-text search, a search engine examines all of the words in every stored document as it tries to match search criteria (for example, text specified by a user). It is distinguished from searches based on metadata or on parts of the original texts represented in databases. Hybrid Search with Reranking Hybrid search is a combination of full -text and vector queries that execute against a search index that contains both searchable plain text content and generated embeddings. It combines results from both full -text and vector queries, which use different ranking functions. A Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) algorithm merges the results. The query response provides just one result set, using RRF to pick the most relevant matches from each query. SHy SHy (for Single Hybrid) implements the hybrid search with reranking pipeline, with the difference that each document in the collection is treated a s a single collection. The design and implementation of this pipeline was motivated by the necessity of acquiring more space and horizontal knowledge from all the provided documents, so to answer broader and summarisation-oriented questions that users migh t have about the whole collection. ColBERTv2 ColBERT is based on Late Interaction, introduced in [52], which encodes each passage into fine-grained token-level embeddings and finds passages that contextually match a query using scalable vector-similarity operators. ColBERTv2 [53] is a follow-up to ColBERT achieving 6-10x storage reduction while maintaining performance. It uses compression techniques and denoised supervision. 4.3.2 System architecture The system is structured as in Figure 3, in a hybrid cloud architecture, with part of the system running on premises in the JRC datacentre, and part in Azure
