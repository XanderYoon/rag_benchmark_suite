missing of crucial information. The second one is the generation phase, where it might produce content which is not supported by the retrieved contexts, or that also be irrelevant, toxic or redundant. A reference implementation of several pipelines that use LLMs to analyse scientific publications and policy documents within the health domain was preparedperformed, as illustrated in the following. Such pipelines go collectively under the name of RAGEv (Retrieval Augmented Generation Evaluation) and are used in all the subsequent experiments of this report. The RAGEv 14 system is to be considered a proof of concept and a working tool that, while extremely useful for the preparation of this report, is not scalable enough to be used as a full Information System. Interested readers are welcome to use it carefully to reproduce the results of this report, or to benchmark their own use cases, but please consider its purpose to serve as a proof-of-concept rather than as operational tool. Selected functionalities will be embedded inside the AI for Health space of GPT@JRC, integrating them into one single corporate tool. GPT@JRC is a platform for scientific and non- scientific staff of the EC (European Commission) to securely explore the use of pre-trained Large Language Models. It offers secure access to a wide variety of text Generative AI models to assist with written office tasks and support scientific work. User prompts and the generated responses are not shared with third parties. GPT@JRC allows the users to interact and work with different Large Language Models, such as the commercial OpenAI GPT family models (currently: GPT 3.5, GPT 3.5 large, GPT 4, GPT 4 32k, GPT4 Turbo), and some powerful open source models (such as: Nous Hermes Mixtral, Llama 3 70B chat, MistralOrca 7b, Zephyr beta 7b15). Our proposed system, RAGEv, could be used to
