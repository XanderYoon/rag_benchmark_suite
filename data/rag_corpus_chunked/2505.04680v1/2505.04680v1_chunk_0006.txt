with potential applications across numerous domains [2]. In the healthcare sector, these models offer promising opportunities to process, analyze, and generate insights from vast amounts of documentation [3]. LLMs, with their ability to understand context, extract relevant information, and generate human -like text, present a novel approach to addressing these challenges of information overload, but come with their own set of problems and limitations. 2.1 Objectives and key results The purpose of this report is threefold: first, to conduct an exhaustive investigation into the current best practices for the safe and trustworthy utilization of LLM in the processing of healthcare data and scientific papers. Second, it aims to introduce an internally developed proof of concept pipeline that employs these prac tices to deliver safe and trustable processing for scientific papers in the health domain called RAGEv 4 (Retrieval Augmented Generation Evaluation), to assess the potential and drawbacks of the methods for different types of documents in the health domain. Furthermore, it aims to disseminate a benchmark dataset to verify the accuracy and veracity of the results called RAGEv-Bench5. Finally, it draws conclusions and provides recommendations on the use of the method and its actual way of implementation. Our main conclusions are that careful implementations of RAG techniques could minimize most of the common problems in the use of LLMs for document processing, obtaining very high scores both on short yes/no answers and long answers. There is a high potential for incorporating it into the day -to-day work of policy support tasks, but additional efforts are required to obtain a consistent and trustworthy tool. 2.2 Structure of the document Chapter 3 introduces the state of the art of the technologies used in this report , the context of the problem and the possible solutions. Chapter 4 explains in detail the methodology,
