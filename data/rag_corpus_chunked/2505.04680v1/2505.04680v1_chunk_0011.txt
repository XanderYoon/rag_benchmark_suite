Toxicity and the generation of inappropriate content are also concerns that must be addressed [15], especially given the sensitive nature of medical information retrieval. Regulatory compliance adds another layer of complexity, since the development and use of AI in healthcare is subject to strict and evolving regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)8, the AI Act 9 and the Medical Devices Regulation (MDR)10. Ensuring compliance while leveraging the capabilities of LLMs requires careful navigation of legal and ethical frameworks. Data quality and consistency pose significant challenges, as medical data in publications is often inconsistent, incomplete, or recorded in non-standard formats. LLMs may struggle with these inconsistencies, leading to unreliable outputs. Moreover, the dee p domain knowledge 4 https://www.langchain.com/ 5 Dify.AI · The Innovation Engine for Generative AI Applications 6 https://www.perplexity.ai/ 7 https://copilot.microsoft.com/ 8 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj 9 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/regulatory-framework-ai 10 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32017R0745 7 required in medical contexts may be beyond the capabilities of general-purpose LLMs, leading to potential misinterpretations of nuanced medical information. There is also a risk of over-reliance on LLM outputs, potentially leading to we akening critical thinking and automation bias where users might overlook their own expertise or (patient, organ, disease, specialty)-specific factors [16]. This raises broader ethical questions about decision-making, patient autonomy, and the role of AI in health at large. Addressing these limitations requires implementing robust safeguards, continuous monitoring, and maintaining human oversight. Developing health -specific LLMs trained on high-quality, diverse, and multimodal data , and adhering to strict ethical and regulatory guidelines could mitigate some of these concerns. However, it is crucial to approach the use of LLMs in health document analysis with caution, ensuring that their use enhances rather than compromises the quality and equity of patient care. 3.3 Proposed solutions and approaches We identified in the previous section several critical aspects for the use
