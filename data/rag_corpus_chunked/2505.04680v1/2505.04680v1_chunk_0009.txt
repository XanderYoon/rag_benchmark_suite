The research on LLMs has been largely advanced by industry in the last few years, due to the need of huge, concentrated investment in hardware and talent required . A remarkable milestone was the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI, which has attracted widespread attention from society. Among the many tools that currently use LLMs to process documents, ScopusAI 3 is a new functionality available in S copus, a repository database of scientific publications. ScopusAI applies advanced technologies in the form “ Question&Answer” to extract information from the publications. The user poses a specific question for which the system provides a comprehensive answer that includes references for each of the statements. In addition, it allows the extraction, in the form of an Excel table, of all relevant information related to the publication enco ded in the metafile. Furthermore, the system creates a concept map corresponding to the answer provided, and it proposes three consequent prompts to dive into more specific details of different aspects of the answer. Additionally, many online and open sour ce tools are available to implement systems for the use of LLMs to process 3 https://www.elsevier.com/products/scopus/scopus-ai 6 documents such as LangChain 4, DiFy5, Perplexity AI6, Microsoft Copilot7, and many more. All of those systems unfortunately suffer from the problems described in the next sections. 3.2 Specific challenges for health documents LLMs trained on public data may inadvertently expose private information if not properly managed [8], [9], [10], and this needs to be taken into account when using AI technologies to process health documents that are not in public domain (like open access scientific papers) or that contain sensitive personal information. Furthermore, LLMs can perpetuate or amplify existing biases in medical data and practices reported in scientific studies, potentially leading to less accurate or biased results for underrepresented groups
