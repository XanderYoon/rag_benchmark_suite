based on figures, graphs or tables. In fact, the results obtained during the different stages of the development on each of the three collections, demonstrated some issues when extracting information from tables, figures and/or subheadings. Analysis of the answers showed that the splitting of the documents in chunks did not respect the structure of the tables, more in the case of large tables, therefore it could not extract the i nformation correctly. This issue will be tackled in future versions. Furthermore, RAGEv is not intended for analysing figures. As a result, Figure 7 shows the main type of questions evaluated during the usability test performed in the development stages for each of the collections, after removal of those targeting tables, figures, and subheadings. Most questions were “focused/concept” or “numerical” that aim to extract specific information from the body of the collections. A few questions have a “general” f ocus aiming to evaluate the performance of RAGEv when summarizing the information from the collections. 24 Figure 7 - Number of questions per type of question for the three collections used during the usability checks When using the system and evaluating its performance, it is important to have in mind: a) the system is currently developed to analyse textual strings (text and numbers); b) the answer is not exhaustive nor complete; c) the questions need to be properly framed. Some general issues identified in all three collections are the following ones: a) not all the chunks identified as relevant are relevant, even though are provided as references; b) some chunks were copied from the publications' reference sections rather than the main content; c) references do not always contain the text of the answer. This issue was tackled by applying the SHy pipeline . In addition, there was a consensus regarding the need
