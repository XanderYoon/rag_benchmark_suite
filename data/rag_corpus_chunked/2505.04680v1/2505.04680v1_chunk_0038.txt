not all the chunks identified as relevant are relevant, even though are provided as references; b) some chunks were copied from the publications' reference sections rather than the main content; c) references do not always contain the text of the answer. This issue was tackled by applying the SHy pipeline . In addition, there was a consensus regarding the need to associate the references to each individual statement of the answer instead providing them at the very end. This will facilitate the user in the necessary verification for completeness and accuracy. This suggestion was implemented in the current available RAGEv version. 5.2.2 Horizon research (HR) The version of the reference pipeline (RAGEv) that was tested during the development phase successfully impedes hallucinations and provides answers always based on the content of the source documents. The system provides good quality answers if the questions is very specific and focused on details clearly described in the documents. For more generic qu estions, such as the request to summarise the content of multiple documents, or to extrapolate information across multiple documents, the system can provide a relatively good overview, identifying most of the important information, but not exhaustively. A general problem that we found during the use cases with the initial RAG implementation is that it does not always identify all the relevant parts of text from all the source documents to formulate the answers. Thus, if the question is general, it might mi ss some information (that might be highly relevant), if the question is very specific it might miss information that can change the meaning of the answer. To this end, the SHy pipeline was developed, which explicitly interrogates all documents and returns much more additional context, to deal with 25 used cases where it is important to extract all relevant
