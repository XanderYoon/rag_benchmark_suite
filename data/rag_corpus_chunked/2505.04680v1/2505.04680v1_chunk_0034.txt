Table 2 - types of collections TYPE Description Relevant Collections containing only documents relevant to the topic Some noise Collections containing some documents that are not relevant or related to the topic Noise only Collections containing just noise, that is, none of the documents contain information relevant to the topic Contrafactual Collections containing contradicting statements However, RAGEv is currently conceived to work with user -defined collections of relevant documents, that is, the ones without noise or contradictory information. Future extensions of RAGEv, not based on user -uploaded collections, will demand testing other types of collections. There is a rich body of literature to evaluate the usability of AI systems [56]. The questions tried to address different types of information suc h as numerical values, open questions, more specific questions; but also, information located in different parts of the document (tables or text). In addition, two questions were prepared that were included in more than one document to see how the systems would respond to that. The questions chosen for each of the collections are classified by type according to the following classification: Table 3 – Question types Type 0 Type 1 Type 2 Type 3 Type 4 Type 5 Type 6 General/Summary Yes/No Numerical Table Focused Figure Subtitles 21 Furthermore, to harmonise the evaluation of the answers, the quality of the answer was marked with the following scale: Table 4 - Scores Score 0 Score 1 Score 2 Score 3 Score 4 Score 5 No answer or incorrect answer The general topic is understood, but not the scope of the question. The information is misinterpreted. The answer is correct but is missing important information. The answer is correct but missing minor information. The answer is correct and complete. As previously
