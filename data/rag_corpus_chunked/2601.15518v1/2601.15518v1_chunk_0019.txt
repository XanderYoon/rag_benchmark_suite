The parameter ranges for each search method are shown in Table 7. Both approaches trained models with pairwise loss and NDCG as the evaluation metric, with each model trained over 100 rounds and 20 trials performed on the random search.

Their final hyperparameters and training metrics are shown in Table 8.
