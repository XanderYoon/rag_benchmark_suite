The PageRank vector ®𝜋is computed by finding the principal eigenvector of the stochastic matrix 𝑃 such that ®𝜋𝑃=®𝜋. The matrix𝑃 is constructed by row-normalizing the composite adjacency matrix𝑊 with a uniform teleportation matrix𝑇, such that: 𝑃𝑖 𝑗 = ( 𝛼 𝑊𝑖 𝑗Í 𝑘 𝑊𝑖𝑘 + (1−𝛼)𝑇 𝑖 𝑗 if Í 𝑘 𝑊𝑖𝑘 >0 𝑇𝑖 𝑗 if Í 𝑘 𝑊𝑖𝑘 =0 where𝑇 𝑖 𝑗 = 1 𝑁 (1) We compute PageRank on this weighted graph using a damping factor of0 .85via rustworkx (200 iterations, tolerance1 × 10−10) and use it as a feature for reranking [11]. 2.3 Data Augmentation Based on the ToT query elicitation work from He et al. [5], we use LLMs to generate synthetic tip-of-the-tongue queries to augment the training dataset. We revised the prompt (see Appendix B) to generate open-domain queries. The prompt was adapted in two aspects. First, it removes domain-specific keywords such as "movie" and "landmark" and uses general terms such as "object" and "name. " Second, it asks the LLM to return the query inside a code block, which helps extract the query from the LLM response. The LLM models used are gemini-2.5-flash-lite [4], o4-mini [7] and gpt-4o [6]. Next, we sample approximately 5,000 entities from the corpus. We use Wikipedia article pageview and infobox template informa- tion
