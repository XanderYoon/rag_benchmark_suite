This demonstrates that combining multiple retrieval signals with strong LLM-based reranking pro- vides substantial improvements over individual retrieval methods. The top two systems,gmn-rerank-500andgm27q-LMART-1000, both employ hybrid retrieval followed by reranking but differ in their second-stage strategies.gmn-rerank-500uses Gemini-2.5-flash reranking directly on the full hybrid results, whilegm27q-LMART- 1000applies LambdaMART reranking first followed by Gemma- 27B-quantized reranking on a smaller set. Althoughgmn-rerank- 500outperformsgm27q-LMART-1000across all metrics, the latter offers a more computationally efficient approach yet still achieves competitive performance.

These links are curated by editors them- selves, and so we might expect that articles are linked together semantically through categorization. Our graph construction takes these assumptions into account, where the first and second degree directed connections form the basis of a network-theoretic rank. However, the number of connected components when doing so is far too small to be effective on a small query-set of items that we are not necessarily in control of, and would require constructing our own validation or test set so that these popular items are actual part of the recall set.
