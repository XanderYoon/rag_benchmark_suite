and LLM retrieval methods (as shown in Figure 4). The results show that the LLM-generated queries achieve comparable retrieval performance to the origi- nal queries across all retrieval methods, with one outlier: the re- call@1000 for dense retrieval on the original dataset is significantly better than that of the LLM synthetic queries. This further validates the effectiveness of our adapted LLM query generation method. 3.2 LLM Retrieval Results We experiment with several LLMs and compare redirect and alias matching methods. Table 2 shows the results for Gemini-2.5-flash and GPT-OSS models with the two title matching methods across various datasets.

The hybrid approach improves over the best individual method on each dataset. Dev3 shows the strongest absolute performance, while Dev2 demon- strates the largest relative improvement at 11%.
