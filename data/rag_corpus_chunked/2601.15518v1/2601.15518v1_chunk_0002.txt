Figure 1: The two-stage retrieval architecture for ToT search. 2 Methodology 2.1 Baseline Methods For sparse retrieval, we use the PyTerrier BM25 baseline results provided by the ToT track organizers. For dense retrieval, we use the BGE-M3 model [2] to generate query embeddings, and perform dot product similarity search on pre-computed Wikipedia paragraph embeddings from the June 2024 Wikipedia dump [12]. We aggregate paragraph-level scores to article-level scores by taking the maximum paragraph score for each article (i.e max pooling). Although the corpus timestamp differs from the official ToT corpus dated 2023-11-01, we believe the variation is minimal and unlikely to significantly impact overall performance. 2.2 Network Construction We construct a composite directed graph𝐺=(𝑉 , 𝐸) over Wikipedia page links by creating a weighted superposition of three topological signals. The edge weight 𝑤(𝑢, 𝑣) between two article nodes 𝑢 and 𝑣is defined as the sum of three components: arXiv:2601.15518v1 [cs.IR] 21 Jan 2026 Wenxin Zhou, Ritesh Mehta, and Anthony Miyaguchi • Direct Citations:Links where article 𝑢 directly cites article 𝑣, denoted as(𝑢) → (𝑣). • Meta-Path Connections:Indirect links formed via a non- article intermediate node 𝑚 (e.g., a Category or Redirect), denoted as the path(𝑢) → (𝑚) → (𝑣). • Semantic Nearest Neighbors:Edges connected to the 𝑘= 15nearest neighbors based on cosine similarity of BGE-M3 embeddings. Formally, the composite adjacency matrix𝑊 is calculated as𝑊= 𝛼1𝐴𝑑𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡 +𝛼 2𝐴𝑚𝑒𝑡𝑎 +𝛼 3𝐴𝑠𝑒𝑚, where 𝐴 represents the adjacency matrix for each respective signal and 𝛼1 = 1.0, 𝛼2 = 0.5, and 𝛼3 = 0.25. Table 1: Summary statistics for graph centrality measures (𝑁= 6.6𝑀). The distribution is highly skewed, with the mean substantially larger than the median. Metric Mean Std. Dev.
