from the actual pagelink graph, and we can insert extra items into the set of retrieved item sorted by order of their importance in an attempt to increase recall on retrieval. We could also use important network nodes to generate tip of the tongue query and result-sets by sampling articles proportional to their importance, and looking for similar articles within one or two hops of the sampled article as a target. 4.2 Topic-Aware Dense Retrieval Performance The topic-aware multi-index dense retrieval (top_model_dense) ap- proach demonstrated a trade-off between computational efficiency and recall compared to the baseline BGE-M3 approach. While parti- tioning the corpus into 24 topic-specific indexes and routing queries accordingly reduced search space and improved early precision met- rics (NDCG@100: 0.1401 vs 0.122; recall@10: 0.172 vs 0.1447), it resulted in a slight decrease in overall recall@1000 (0.5096 vs 0.5498). This suggests that topic-based partitioning may occasionally ex- clude relevant documents when query classification is imperfect or when target information spans multiple topical domains. It is im- portant to note that this submission represents first-stage retrieval only, without any reranking applied. As demonstrated by our other submissions that incorporated reranking stages, the addition of a reranker could significantly boost these results while still maintain- ing the computational advantages of topic-specific routing during the initial retrieval phase. 4.3 LambdaMARAT Generalization We evaluated the impact of the LambdaMART reranker by com- paring performance before and after using it to rerank the hy- brid retrieval results on the test set. The hybrid results contained an average of 1,829 candidates per query. Following reranking, recall@1000 improved from 0.5700 to 0.6109, which shows that the model effectively surfaces relevant documents into the top 1,000. However, the Reciprocal Rank fell significantly from 0.2838 to 0.0601. This indicates that while LambdaMART excels at iden- tifying relevant documents,
