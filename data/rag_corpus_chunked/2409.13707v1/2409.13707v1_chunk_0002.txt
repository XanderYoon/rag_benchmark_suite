agent after a series of interactions. It required a system that would respond only to cases that did not need any additional information or clarification from the customer. That is, the support case could be resolved based only on the initial information present in the case subject and description when the ticket was first opened. Addition- ally, the use case required that solutions be grounded in an official support document that would be presented to the cus- tomer as a link along with the summarized solution. Given these use case requirements, retrieval augmented generation (RAG) was a natural fit (Lewis et al. 2020). It is a common solution that addresses the two main issues of in- adequate generalizability to more niche domains and model size limits. It does so by using a retrieval system to first retrieves the necessary domain knowledge which a smaller generative model then leverages as context for answer gen- eration. We present the resulting system for IT support case solu- tion recommendation that combines an encoder-only model for classification, two dense embedding models for retrieval, and generative large language models for query and answer generation. The solution brings several novel contributions to the field of AIOps: • The first reported evaluation of a RAG system for IT sup- port incident resolution recommendation. • The first reported use of a classifier for determining sin- gle vs multi-turn IT support cases. • Evidence of substantial retrieval improvement using re-ranking based on a new model, IBM Slate 125m (IBM Research 2024) • A comparison of answer generation performance across diverse model sizes that shows smaller models can match or even beat the performance of very large models in the RAG incident remediation use case.
