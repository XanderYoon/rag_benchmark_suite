Clients might choose to not use larger proprietary models such as GPT-4 due to cost and privacy concerns and so are limited to smaller models with potentially less domain coverage that do not generalize to the client’s domain. Re- trieval augmented generation is a common solution that ad- dresses both of these issues: a retrieval system first retrieves the necessary domain knowledge which a smaller generative model leverages as context for generation. We present a sys- tem developed for a client in the IT Support domain for sup- port case solution recommendation that combines retrieval augmented generation (RAG) for answer generation with an encoder-only model for classification and a generative large language model for query generation. We cover architecture details, data collection and annotation, development journey and preliminary validations, expected final deployment pro- cess and evaluation plans, and finally lessons learned. 1 Introduction The recent boost in performance and popularization of gen- erative models has resulted in clients across various domains requesting generative AI powered question-answering and recommendation systems. However, there are two critical issues facing many clients wishing to implement genera- tive AI: domain coverage and model size constraints due to model choice limitations. Much of the focus for gener- ative models has been on the general domain and only some specific tasks such as coding. Models that work on these domains might
