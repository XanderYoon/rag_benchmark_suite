powered question-answering and recommendation systems. However, there are two critical issues facing many clients wishing to implement genera- tive AI: domain coverage and model size constraints due to model choice limitations. Much of the focus for gener- ative models has been on the general domain and only some specific tasks such as coding. Models that work on these domains might not necessarily work for a client’s targeted domain. Additionally, clients might choose not to leverage larger proprietary models such as GPT-4 because of cost and privacy concerns so clients are limited to smaller models with less domain coverage and likely lower out-of-the-box performance. We have faced both of these issues when building a solu- tion recommendation system for resolving IT support cases. Models and tasks within the domain of IT support and Ar- tificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) are under- researched.

Thus, it is non-trivial to evaluate out-of-the-box AI models on IT sup- port tasks as well as train and evaluate custom AI solutions in this domain. In specific, the IT support use case involved IT prod- uct support tickets that are opened by a customer and an- swered by a support agent after a series of interactions. It required a system that would respond only to cases that did not need any additional information or clarification from the customer. That is, the support case could be resolved based only on the initial information present in the case subject and description when the ticket was first opened. Addition- ally, the use case
