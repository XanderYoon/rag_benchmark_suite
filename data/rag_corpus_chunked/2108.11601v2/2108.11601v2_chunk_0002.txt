via information retrieval technique. In this work, we present REDCODER, a Retrieval augment ED COD e g Eneration and summaRization framework. While designing RED- CODER, we take motivation from how developers take advantage of existing resources. For example, developers often search for relevant code in the code repository, and if found, adapt the retrieved code in their own context. Similarly, when an API usage is unclear, they search in question answering forums (e.g., StackOverﬂow) (Brandt et al., 2010; Sadowski et al., 2015). Such an additional resource helps developers to increase their development pro- ductivity (Li et al., 2013). We design REDCODER as a two-step process (see Figure 1). In the ﬁrst step, given the input (nl text for code generation, or code snippet for sum- marization) a retriever module retrieves relevant source code (for code generation) or summaries arXiv:2108.11601v2 [cs.SE] 10 Sep 2021 Figure 1: Illustration of our proposed framework REDCODER for code generation. Given an input summary, we ﬁrst retrieve top-k candidate code (k=1 in this example). We then aggregate them and based on that a generator module generates the target sequence. (for code summarization) from a database.1 In the second step, a generator processes the retrieved code/summary along with the original input to gen- erate the target output. In this way, REDCODER enhances the generation capability by augmenting the input through retrieval. The two-step process allows us to design a modular and conﬁgurable framework for source code and summary gener- ation. Various designs of retriever and generator models can be incorporated into this framework. Existing cross-encoder code retrievers being computationally expensive, their applicability to retrieve from a large database is limited (Humeau et al., 2020). A natural choice would be to use sparse term based retrievers such as TF-IDF or BM25 (Robertson and Zaragoza, 2009). However, the retriever
