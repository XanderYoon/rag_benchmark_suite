BDIE benchmarks. (2) We propose a new metric class for Line Items Recognition, General Line Items Recognition Metric (GLIRM), that is more aligned with practical BDIE use cases compared to existing metrics, such as ANLS*, DocILE, and GriTS. (3) We provide a heuristic algorithm for backcalculating bounding boxes of predicted line items and tables without the need for vision encoders. Finally, we claim that, while LMMs might sometimes offer marginal performance benefits, LLMs + RASG is oftentimes superior given real-world applications and constraints of BDIE.

I NTRODUCTION In practice, Business Document Information Extraction (BDIE) is done because one wants to connect human orga- nizations such as businesses and governments with indefinite interfaces (such as printed/handwritten documents) to down- stream systems with definite interfaces (such as Application Program Interfaces). For a machine learning system to be good at BDIE, it has to be good at interfacing with these downstream programs and at least minimally aware of what these programs do with the data. In the succeeding sections, we discuss how we can achieve these goals with our new methodology, Retrieval Augmented Structured Generation (RASG), and our new proposed metric class, General Line Items Recognition Metric (GLIRM). BDIE has two main sub-problems, Key Information Ex- traction (KIE) and Line Items Recognition (LIR) [1]. The goal of KIE is to extract and format information from the document into key-value pairs. And the goal of LIR is to extract information into a list of line items where each line item corresponds to a row in a table formatted into column key-value pairs. And unlike Table Structure Recognition, the order of the columns do not matter so long as the columns are mapped to the
