can be extended to support multiple similarity measures more appropriate for downstream tasks. Attribute #5 is relevant in cases where there are extra or missing rows in the predictions. We only want to penalize such rows, not the rows with matching ground truth. Attribute #6 is important because there are documents where the order of the rows matter. For example, documents where transactions are ordered by time. And finally, Attribute #7 is an ideal attribute because the order of the columns do not often matter when applying business logic to the line items. Downstream programs often then save the results (and the extracted data) to column- invariant SQL-like databases. A. Limitations of Current Line Items Recognition Metrics ANLS* and the DocILE metric use Maximum-Weight Bi- partite Matching-based algorithms for row-matching [9] [10]. Thus, they do not satisfy attribute #6. Furthermore, the latter supports both cell content and cell location recognition but does not isolate the two–violating attribute #1. This makes it impossible to use for cell content recognition only or cell location recognition only tasks. GriTS satisfies all of the attributes above except for attribute #7 [2]. For the rest of the section, we describe a new metric that satisfies all of the attributes above which we call General Line Items Recognition Metric (GLIRM). This metric can both be viewed as an extension of ANLS* and DocILE so they satisfy attributes #1 and #6, and a relaxation of GriTS, so it satisfies attribute #7. B. Similarity Matching Score As per attributes and #1 and #4, we will use f (cp, ct) to denote the similarity measure between a predicted cell, cp, and a ground truth cell, ct. f can be any similarity measure appropriate for the downstream task. Exact match for product reference numbers, Intersection-over-Union for bounding boxes, etc. To
