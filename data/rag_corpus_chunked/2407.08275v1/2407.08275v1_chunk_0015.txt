bge models. Shifting our attention to top-𝑘 retrieval similarity, clusters vary depending on the𝑘 value. Figure 3 illustrates how Jaccard similarity evolves over 𝑘 on NFCorpus. The first plot displays Jaccard scores between bge-large and all other models, while the second plot illustrates the scores for gte-large. For extremely low 𝑘, we observe some peaks for nearly all models, followed by a noticeable drop in similarity. Of course, for larger 𝑘, the scores converge to one. Re-affirming our earlier observations with the CKA metric, bge- large demonstrates high retrieval similarity with UAE and mxbai. Similarity to the remaining models is much lower, with the highest scores for bge-base and bge-small for larger 𝑘. However, especially for small 𝑘, there is high variance in similarity score, with models from other families, e.g. Mistral or gte-large sometimes achieving higher scores than the bge models. A similar pattern can also be observed in the second plot, where Jaccard similarity for gte-large is highest within its family for larger 𝑘, but models like mxbai or bge- base sometimes reporting higher similarity for small 𝑘. Therefore, the clusters we identified through our CKA analysis are only truly reflected in these plots for large values of𝑘. This suggest that in real- world use cases, where the top-𝑘 are crucial, such representational similarity measures might not provide the full picture. The plots for other model families provide nearly identical insights as those in the second plot in Figure 3 and thus we do not present them for sake of brevity. For rank similarity, scores peak for small 𝑘 and then quickly start to drop until they approach a low stable score for larger 𝑘 as shown in Figure 2 for gte-large. Once again, the bge/UAE/mxbai inter-family cluster shows the highest similarity. In contrast to Jaccard similarity, the
