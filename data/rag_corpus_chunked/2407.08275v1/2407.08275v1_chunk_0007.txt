We then retrieve the 𝑘 most similar embeddings in terms of the cosine similarity for a particular query. As these embeddings cor- respond to specific chunks of text, we derive the sets of retrieved chunks C and C’ for a pair of models. To measure the similarity of these sets, we use the Jaccard similarity coefficient as follows: 𝐽𝑎𝑐𝑐𝑎𝑟𝑑 (𝐶, 𝐶′) = |𝐶 ∩ 𝐶′ | |𝐶 ∪ 𝐶′ | (2) Here, |𝐶 ∩ 𝐶′ | corresponds to the overlap in text chunks by counting how often the two models retrieved the same chunks. Similarly, we can compute the union |𝐶 ∪ 𝐶′ |, which corresponds to all retrieved text chunks, counting chunks present in both sets only once. The resulting score is bounded in the interval [0, 1] with 1 indicating that both models retrieved the same set of text chunks. While Jaccard similarity computes the percentage to which two sets overlap, it ignores the order in the sets. Rank similarity [36], on the other hand, considers the order of
