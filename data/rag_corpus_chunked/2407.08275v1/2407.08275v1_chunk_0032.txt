shows a notable level of similarity, while the scores of the remaining clusters indicate only moderate to low levels of similarity. Additionally, as documents often need to be chunked into smaller parts to fit into the models, the effect of chunking strategies such as token-based or semantic chunking on embedding similarity could be explored. Furthermore, our evaluation focused on a small sample of similarity measures, with their own definition about which crite- ria make models similar. Introducing more measures with different perspectives could improve our understanding on which factors influence model similarity. Finally, our focus was on identifying clusters or families of models, which for our initial experiments led us to choosing families of embedding models with varying perfor- mance on MTEB. With the frequent appearance of new models on the leaderboard and the focus on good MTEB performance, it would be of interest to compare the best performing models on MTEB and check if their relative difference in performance correlates with how similar these models are.
