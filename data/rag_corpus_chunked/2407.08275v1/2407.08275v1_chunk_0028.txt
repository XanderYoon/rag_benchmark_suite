pairwise comparison as well as Jaccard and rank similarity to compare retrieval behavior at top-𝑘 across five datasets. Comparing embeddings with CKA generally showed intra- and inter-family clusters across datasets. These clusters also appeared when evaluating top-𝑘 retrieval simi- larity with large 𝑘 values. However, scores for low 𝑘 values, which would commonly be chosen in RAG systems, show high variance and much lower similarity, especially on larger datasets. Although we were able to identify some model clusters, our results suggest that choosing the optimal model remains a non-trivial task that requires careful consideration. Still, we argue that a better understanding of how similarly dif- ferent embedding models behave is an important research topic that requires further attention. There are a plethora of real-world scenarios where RAG systems can potentially be deployed. One such scenario, for example, is to retrieve relevant web content in re- sponse to a query. As large corpora of such data are available in the form of Web ARChive (WARC) files, evaluating embedding model similarity on such large, uncleaned datasets would perhaps lead to a better estimation of model similarity for a realistic RAG use case.
