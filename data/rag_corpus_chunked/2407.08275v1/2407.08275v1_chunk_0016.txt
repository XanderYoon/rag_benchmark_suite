Figure 3 and thus we do not present them for sake of brevity. For rank similarity, scores peak for small 𝑘 and then quickly start to drop until they approach a low stable score for larger 𝑘 as shown in Figure 2 for gte-large. Once again, the bge/UAE/mxbai inter-family cluster shows the highest similarity. In contrast to Jaccard similarity, the clusters that could be observed for CKA do not always show for rank similarity. As can be seen in Figure 2, the model with the highest rank similarity to gte-large is mxbai, rather than another gte model. Even so, the previously observed clusters also tend to appear for rank similarity, though they vary more depending on the models and dataset. Generally, scores for nearly all models are rather small for larger 𝑘, indicating low rank similarity. For small 𝑘, results vary more and differences between individual models are more pronounced. As retrieval similarity at small 𝑘 is of most interest from a prac- tical perspective, we take a closer look at top-10 Jaccard similarity. The heatmaps in Figures 4-6 show the top-10 Jaccard similarity between models across datasets. A striking insight here is that even the most similar models only report a Jaccard similarity of higher than 0.6, with the majority less than 0.5. This is of great relevance to practitioners, as it would imply that even using embeddings from models that report high representational similarity scores may yield little overlap in retrieved text chunks. As earlier, the cluster of UAE/mxbai/bge-large is the most prominent one with the highest scores. Intra-family scores tend to be the highest for most models, i.e. t5 and OpenAI. Depending on the dataset, this also applies to gte and e5 models, although Jaccard similarity to models from other families is sometimes higher. We also note
