Scores are highest and vary most for small 𝑘, but then drop quickly before stabilizing for larger 𝑘. 5 RESULTS To evaluate how similar embeddings generated by different models are, we will first consider model families, checking if their pairwise and top-k similarity scores are highest within their family. Subse- quently, we will identify the open source models which are most similar to our chosen proprietary models. 5.1 Intra- and Inter-Family Clusters Comparing embeddings directly with CKA shows high similarity across most of the models, albeit with some variance. These scores allow us to identify certain clusters of models. Figure 1 shows the pair-wise CKA scores of all models averaged across the five datasets. As expected, scores for most models are highest within their own family. This holds true for the gtr-t5, sentence-t5 and text- embedding-3 (OpenAI) models. Although the sentence-t5 and gtr-t5 models are closely related, they do not exhibit significantly higher similarity with each other compared to the remaining models. From an inter-family perspective, we observe high similarity between the bge and gte models. For some models in these two fam- ilies, interestingly, the highest similarity scores rather correspond to inter-family counterparts with matching embedding dimensions than with models in the same family. Specifically, gte-small reports the highest similarity to bge-small and gte-base to bge-base. On the other hand, gte-large shows slightly higher similarity to bge-base than bge-large and thus to a model with a lower embedding dimen- sion. Another inter-family cluster is formed by the three models with the highest CKA scores overall,
