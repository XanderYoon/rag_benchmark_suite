on the data (see Figures 4 and 5). Similar observations can be made for rank similarity, although the appearance of family clusters is more dependent on the dataset. Larger datasets also lead to lower scores. These results illustrate that while family clusters can still be perceived at small 𝑘, they are not as prominent as they are for larger 𝑘. Furthermore, the top-10 retrieved results differ substantially for most models and datasets and their similarity might be dependent on the dataset itself. 5.2 Open Source Alternatives to Proprietary Models We explicitly included proprietary models in our analysis to check which open source models are the best - which in our case means the most similar - alternative. The CKA scores in Figure 1 indicate that embeddings generated by OpenAI’s models (text-embedding- 3-large/-small) are highly similar to those generated by Mistral, while the Cohere model (embed-english-v3.0) demonstrates high similarity to e5-large-v2. These observations do not entirely extend to retrieval similarity, especially for Cohere. While Mistral is still the most similar model to OpenAI’s for larger𝑘 across all datasets, there is no consistently most similar model for Cohere. Rather, the model varies depending on the dataset and measure - Jaccard and rank similarity - sometimes showing highest similarity to e5-large-v2, but sometimes also to other models like Mistral. Taking a closer look at top-10 similarity, Mistral still largely exhibits the highest similarity to the OpenAI models, especially to text-embedding-3-large. For text-embedding- 3-small, scores on all datasets are rather close to those of other models. In absolute terms, however, retrieval similarity between Mistral and OpenAI models is only low to moderate. On smaller datasets, the highest Jaccard similarity to text-embedding-3-large only reaches about 0.6 (see Figure 5), while on TREC-COVID, the largest dataset, Jaccard similarity goes down to merely 0.18 (see Figure 6).
