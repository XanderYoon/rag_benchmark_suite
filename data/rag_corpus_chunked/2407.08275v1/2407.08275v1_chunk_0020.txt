The clusters vary slightly depending on the measure, as do the scores. Models tend to be most similar to models from their own family. However, some inter-family clusters are visible as well. two larger datasets FiQA-2018 and TREC-COVID, the similarity scores are generally substantially lower, as can be seen in Figure 6. For the smaller datasets, Jaccard similarity is generally higher, though results differ depending on the data (see Figures 4 and 5). Similar observations can be made for rank similarity, although the appearance of family clusters is more dependent on the dataset. Larger datasets also lead to lower scores. These results illustrate that while family clusters can still be perceived at small 𝑘, they are not as prominent as they are for larger 𝑘.
