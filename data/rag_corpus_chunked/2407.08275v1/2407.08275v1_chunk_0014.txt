embedding dimensions than with models in the same family. Specifically, gte-small reports the highest similarity to bge-small and gte-base to bge-base. On the other hand, gte-large shows slightly higher similarity to bge-base than bge-large and thus to a model with a lower embedding dimen- sion. Another inter-family cluster is formed by the three models with the highest CKA scores overall, namely UAE, mxbai and bge- large, whose scores suggest almost perfect embedding similarity.

While bge-large shows high similarity to UAE-Large-v1 and mxbai-embed-large-v1, scores for gte-large are clustered much closer. Jaccard similarity seems to be most unstable for small values of 𝑘, which would commonly be chosen for retrieval tasks. fact, the similarity score of bge-large to these two models is much higher than to other bge models. Shifting our attention to top-𝑘 retrieval similarity, clusters vary depending on the𝑘 value. Figure 3 illustrates how Jaccard similarity evolves over 𝑘 on NFCorpus. The first plot displays Jaccard scores between bge-large and all other models, while the second plot illustrates the scores for gte-large. For extremely low 𝑘, we observe some peaks for nearly all models, followed
