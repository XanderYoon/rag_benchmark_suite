context. Our analysis demonstrates that although models tend to be most similar to models from their own family, inter-family clusters exist. The most prominent of these clusters is formed by the models bge- large-en-v1.5, UAE-Large-V1 and mxbai-embed-large-v1, which demonstrate high similarity even for retrieval at low 𝑘. Never- theless, the high variance of retrieval similarity of the remaining clusters for small 𝑘 means that while the identified clusters might provide some measure of orientation when choosing an embedding model, the choice still remains a non-trivial task. Identifying suit- able alternatives to proprietary models is likewise not as simple. While we were able to determine SFR-Embedding-Mistral as the model being most similar to OpenAI’s embedding models, Jaccard similarity at top-10 for larger datasets shows a low overlap in re- trieved text chunks. Furthermore, for Cohere’s embedding model, we were unable to find a single most similar model, as this model varied across datasets for small 𝑘 values. 7 CONCLUSION In this paper we evaluated the similarity of embedding models on different datasets. Given the large number of available models, iden- tifying clusters or families of models with similar embeddings can simplify the model selection process. While previous work on LLM similarity exists, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, it so far lacks a clear focus on embedding models specifically in the context of RAG. We therefore analyzed the similarity of embeddings gener- ated by 19 different models using CKA for pairwise comparison as well as Jaccard and rank similarity to compare retrieval behavior at top-𝑘 across five datasets. Comparing embeddings with CKA generally showed intra- and inter-family clusters across datasets. These clusters also appeared when evaluating top-𝑘 retrieval simi- larity with large 𝑘 values. However, scores for low 𝑘 values, which would commonly be chosen in RAG systems, show high
