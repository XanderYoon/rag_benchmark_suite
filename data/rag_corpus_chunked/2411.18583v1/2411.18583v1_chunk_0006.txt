The SciTLDR dataset from the Hugging Face is selected for this research work [13]. It contains the summarization of scientific documents. It is a dataset with 5,400 TLDRs derived from over 3,200 papers. It contains both author-written and expert -derived TLDRs of scientific documents. Curated research articles’ abstract, introduction, and conclusion (AIC) or full text of the paper are given as ”source” and the summaries of the corresponding articles are given as ”target”. Only these two attributes are utilized in all three proposed procedures. There is no training for the spaCy approach, but the dataset is utilized for testing purposes. The T5 model is trained using the SciTLDR dataset for the transformer -based approach and later evaluated on the test dataset. For the LLM - based approach, this dataset is u sed as the knowledge base for the model. B. The Procedure Utilizing the Frequency -Based Approach using spaCy The first procedure utilizes the frequency-based approach by using spaCy. The first task is to build the model pipeline. The model pipeline takes text as input and converts the text into NLP tokens using the spaCy library. Then preprocessing step is done by removing stop words and punctuation. Afterward, the word frequency is calculated for each word which later helps to calculate individual sentence weights. This sentence weight represents the importance of that sentence. Then the top 10 percent of sentences are selected as the final output. The model is later evaluated using ROUGE scores to get an overview of the performance. The overview of the spaCy Model is given in Figure 1. Figure 1: Building spaCy Model The next step is to implement a system pipeline by usin g the spaCy model to generate a literature review segment automatically. The system takes the DOI and PDF files of multiple papers
