tech - niques such as the Frequency -based approach, Transformer - based a pproach, and Large Language Model -based approach are implemented and compared to find the best procedure. The SciTLDR dataset [3] is selected for this research work. The first procedure uses the frequency-based approach. The library named spaCy [4] is utilized here. The second procedure uses the transformer-based model. The Simple T5 model is utilized here. The last procedure is based on using the Large Language Model. The GPT -3.5-TURBO-0125 model is utilized here. The evaluation and comparison are performed using ROUGE scores [5]. Then the best approach is identified and a Graphical User Interface-based tool is created. Automating aspects of the literature review process allows academicians to save time and concentrate on the most perti - nent articles for their research. It can also reduce the chance of errors or prejudice in the review process. The highlights of this article are: • All three considered NLP approaches such as spaCy, T5, and GPT-3.5-TURBO-0125 model can produce satisfac - tory results in automating the literature review generation. • The LLM -based model outperforms T5 and spaCy in generating literature reviews. II. LITERATURE REVIEW A framework was proposed by Silva et al. [6] for auto - matically producing systematic literature reviews. They have focused on four technical steps: Searching, Screening, Map - ping, a nd Synthesizing. In response to a specific inquiry, extensive searches are conducted to find as much relevant research as feasible, involving looking through reference lists, scouring internet databases, and reviewing published materials. Screening reduces the search scope by limiting the collection to only the papers pertinent to a particular review, aiming to highlight important findings and facts that could influence policy. Mapping is used to comprehend research activity in a particular area, involve stakeholders, and
