the acceptable mark. From the evaluation, it is seen that the GPT-3.5-turbo model produced results with higher ROUGE -1 and ROUGE-2 scores than the SpaCy and T5 . The overall ROUGE -1 score for the LLM is 0.364 while the score for T5 is 0.268 and spaCy is 0.257. It shows that the LLM-generated summaries have better unigram and bigram overlapping with human summaries. The transformer T5 is also an advanced model which comes in second place. The last position is occupied by the frequency - based spaCy model. From the scores, it is clear that the most advanced mod els are LLMs which outperformed all other NLP techniques. But other approaches such as transformer models and frequency - based approaches are also capable of producing satisfactory ROUGE scores and a coherent literature review segment. VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE SCOPES The research focused on implementing and comparing vari- ous NLP techniques for automated literature review. All three implemented systems are successful in generating the coherent Literature Review segment of a research paper. The results of various Natural Language Processing techniques such as the Frequency-based approach, Transformer model, and Large Language Model are also successfully obtained and compared. Based on the comparisons, the LLM-based approach is proven to be the best-performing one based on ROUGE-N scores. Thus, based on the LLM, a final system tool is also success- fully developed where the user can upload multiple PDF files to automatically generate a coherent literature review segment. Future work of this research work can be focused on enhancing the effectiveness and applicability of the developed system tool. More functionality can be added to the Graphical User Interface such as model options, output size, etc. More models such as Bert, Gemini, and LLaMA can be utilized to find better results.
