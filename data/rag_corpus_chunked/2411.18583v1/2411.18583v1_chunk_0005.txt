reviews (SLRs) and LLMs are discussed by Susnjak et. al. [12]. They also emphasized the need to address challenges in the synthesis phase of research and highlighted the potential of fine -tuning LLMs with datasets to enhance knowledge synthesis accuracy. The study aims to bridge this gap by proposing a Systematic Literature Review automation framework. Most of the related works that have been discussed are mainly focused on discussing the potential and challenges of using NLP techniques and LLMs to automate the literature review process. None of them proposes a complete system pipeline where users can directly generate the literature re- view only using the PDF and DOI. In contrast, this article proposes and implements three unique end -to-end pipelines and procedures for a literature review automation system. This research endeavor has also resulted in the implementation of a UI tool where users can directly upload PDFs and get a literature review segment generated automatically without any additional effort. Moreover, this paper also includes a comparative analysis of different approaches such as the frequency-based approach, transfor mer-based approach, and rag-based approach using ROUGE scores which contributes towards finding the effectiveness of these approaches for this task. III. SYSTEM DESIGN The research is carried out in four stages: 1. Defining research objectives. 2. Proposing mul tiple procedures for au - tomated literature review generation. 3. Evaluating multiple procedures to find the best approach. 4. The final system development. A. Dataset Selection The SciTLDR dataset from the Hugging Face is selected for this research work [13]. It contains the summarization of scientific documents. It is a dataset with 5,400 TLDRs derived from over 3,200 papers. It contains both author-written and expert -derived TLDRs of scientific documents. Curated research articles’ abstract, introduction, and conclusion (AIC) or full text of the paper are given
