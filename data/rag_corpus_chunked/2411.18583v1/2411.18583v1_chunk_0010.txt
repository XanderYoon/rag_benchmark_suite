response from the assistant is retrieved and the outputs of each paper are merged for the final literature review segment. The system pipeline overview of the LLM is given in Figure 6. E. The Final System Tool The final system is implemented using the Large Language Model: GPT -3.5-TURBO-0125 as the backend. An aesthetic and simple user interface is created where the user can easily upload multiple research articles or PDF files. The user has to press the ”Browse files” button and then select the files to upload. Then the system loads the research papers and within a few seconds, it produces the literature review segment automatically. It individually processes each paper and pro - duces output. The load ing screen and processing file numbers indicate the progress level and the number of processed papers. At the end of the literature review, the UI shows ”Done” text to indicate the completion of the task. The user interface of the system is given in Figure 7 Figure 7: The Preview of the System UI IV. SYSTEM EVALUATION The ROUGE scores are used for the evaluation in this research. The evaluation is done based on the test data of the selected dataset. ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a set of metrics used for evaluating the quality of machine -generated summaries by comparing them to reference summaries. The used ROUGE metrics are: • ROUGE-N (precision, recall, and F1 score for n -gram overlaps), • ROUGE-L (measuring longest common subsequence) • ROUGE-Lsum (ROUGE -Longest for summary level evaluation) A. Evaluation of Frequency-Based spaCy The spaCy -based model was evaluated on the test data utilizing the ROUGE scores. The results are stated in Table I. Table I: ROUGE Scores for spaCy ROUGE-1 0.257 ROUGE-2 0.055 ROUGE-L 0.144 ROUGE-L SUM 0.146 B. Evaluation of
