evaluated using ROUGE scores to get an overview of the performance. The overview of the spaCy Model is given in Figure 1. Figure 1: Building spaCy Model The next step is to implement a system pipeline by usin g the spaCy model to generate a literature review segment automatically. The system takes the DOI and PDF files of multiple papers as input. It uses the Requests library to collect the paper titles and first author names from the DOI. Then it uses PYPDF2 and Regular Expression (RE) libraries to collect only the conclusion of each PDF. Then it uses the previously implemented spaCy model to get a summary of each paper. Later it performs post -processing and merges all summaries to produce a coherent literature review segment. The system pipeline overview of the spaCy Model is given in Figure 2. Figure 2: Pipeline using spaCy C. The Procedure Utilizing the Transformer-Based T5 Model The second approach utilizes the transformer-based Simple T5 model. The first task is to train the model and prepare the model for the final pipeline. The SciTLDR dataset is collected to train the model. Then the dataset is prepared to use as the training data for the selected model. A task -specific prefix is added to summarize individual papers. Then the model is fine- tuned as per the requirements. Then the model is trained with the training data and the result is predicted. The result is the summarization of individual papers. Then the evaluation is performed using ROUGE scores and the model is saved for further utilization later in the system pipeline. The training overview of the Transformer Model is given in Figure 3.
