-gram overlaps), • ROUGE-L (measuring longest common subsequence) • ROUGE-Lsum (ROUGE -Longest for summary level evaluation) A. Evaluation of Frequency-Based spaCy The spaCy -based model was evaluated on the test data utilizing the ROUGE scores. The results are stated in Table I. Table I: ROUGE Scores for spaCy ROUGE-1 0.257 ROUGE-2 0.055 ROUGE-L 0.144 ROUGE-L SUM 0.146 B. Evaluation of Transformer T5 The transformer -based model was evaluated on the test data utilizing the ROUGE scores. The results are stated in Table II. Table II: ROUGE Scores for T5 ROUGE-1 0.268 ROUGE-2 0.115 ROUGE-L 0.204 ROUGE-L SUM 0.204 C. Evaluation of Large Language Model: GPT -3.5-TURBO- 0125 The LLM -based model was evaluated on the test data utilizing the ROUGE scores. The results are stated in Table III. Table III: ROUGE Scores for LLM ROUGE-1 0.364 ROUGE-2 0.123 ROUGE-L 0.181 ROUGE-L SUM 0.182 D. Comparison of Multiple Approaches The comparison between all three approaches is provided in Table IV. Table IV: Comparison of Rouge Scores T5 spaCy GPT-3.5-TURBO-0125 ROUGE-1 0.268 0.257 0.364 ROUGE-2 0.115 0.055 0.123 ROUGE-L 0.204 0.144 0.181 ROUGE-L SUM 0.204 0.146 0.182 From the ROUGE scores, it is clear that the LLM -based model outperformed both T5 and spaCy. The Transformer - based model is in the second spot based on the ROUGE-1 score. The evaluation proves that large language models are superior to older NLP approaches. E. User Evaluation on UI The user evaluation was performed on the LLM -based UI system. The user chose 4 research articles as input. These were: • AI-IoT based Healthcare Prognosis Interactive System • Applying Internet of Things and Machine-Learning for Personalized Healthcare: Issues and Challenges • Improving patients health-care using IoT • IoT Based AI and its Implementations in Industries The received output from the system: ”The paper by
