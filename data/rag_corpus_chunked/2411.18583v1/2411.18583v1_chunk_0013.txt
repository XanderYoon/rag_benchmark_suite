IoT sensors to enhance patient care in hospitals. The system utilizes Ultrasonic and IR Proximity Sensors connected to an Arduino Uno for automated IV fluid level monitoring and patient alarm system. The liter - ature review highlights the importance of automated Hospital Management Systems for efficient healthcare administration. The proposed system reduces manpower, costs, and human errors while improving patient care. Future research aims to enhance system scalability and functionality for widespread hospital use. Sheri f El-Gendy explores the integration of IoT and AI in industries in the paper ”IoT Based AI and its Implementations in Industries.” The paper delves into Industry 4.0, IIoT, IAIoT, and IoRT, showcasing the impact on au - tomation and robotics. It discusses IoT challenges, benefits of AI in data analysis, and presents case studies like oil field production optimization and smart robotics by companies like ABB and Boeing. The future of IoT/AI integration promises transformative advancements in various sectors.” V. RESULT AND DISCUSSION The study introduced three procedures for automated lit - erature review generation. The research work also illustrates the performance comparison between various NLP approaches such as the frequency -based method (spaCy), transformer model (Simple T5), and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with LLM (GPT -3.5-turbo). All three procedures are im - plemented and the ROUGE -1, ROUGE -2, ROUGE -L, and ROUGE-Lsum scores are calculated based on the Test dataset. For all three approaches, the ROUGE -1 and ROUGE-2 scores are found above the acceptable mark. From the evaluation, it is seen that the GPT-3.5-turbo model produced results with higher ROUGE -1 and ROUGE-2 scores than the SpaCy and T5 . The overall ROUGE -1 score for the LLM is 0.364 while the score for T5 is 0.268 and spaCy is 0.257. It shows that the LLM-generated summaries have better unigram and bigram
