a coherent literature review segment. Future work of this research work can be focused on enhancing the effectiveness and applicability of the developed system tool. More functionality can be added to the Graphical User Interface such as model options, output size, etc. More models such as Bert, Gemini, and LLaMA can be utilized to find better results.
