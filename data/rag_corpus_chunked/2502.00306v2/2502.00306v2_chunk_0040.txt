Above certain thresholds of which capture meaningful similarity, we observe a positive correlation between MIA score and similarity. Gemma2-2B is the RAG generator; Visualizations with LLaMA 3.1 as the generator can be found in Figure 25. 7.4 Potential Countermeasures Our attack relies on natural queries and the capability of RAG systems to answer user questions accurately based on private data- base knowledge. This makes devising countermeasures without negatively impacting performance challenging. Figure 8 provides valuable insights for considering defensive strategies against our attack. The core reason our attack is effective lies in the distinguish- able distributions of MIA scores for members and non-members. Any effective countermeasure must focus on making these two dis- tributions
