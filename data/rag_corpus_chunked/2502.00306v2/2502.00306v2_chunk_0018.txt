𝑑∗ as relevant context. We achieve this by designing a two-part query format consisting of a Retrieval Summary and a Probe Question, as described below. Retrieval Summary. We first craft a dedicated prompt, denoted Psum, to guide an LLM in producing a short, natural-sounding de- scription 𝑠∗. This summary, generated onlyonce per target document, includes key terms from𝑑∗ and mimics realistic user queries (e.g., “I have a question about . . . ”). Including these keywords increases the likelihood of retrieving 𝑑∗, assuming it resides in the RAG system’s knowledge base. The exact prompts used to generate𝑠∗ are detailed in the Appendix (Figure 16). 5 You are a helpful assistant, below is a query from a user and some relevant contexts… Contexts 𝐷𝑘: Query : ෝ𝑞𝑖 ෝ𝑞𝑖 gn g1 g2 rn 𝑟 r2 RAG System 𝒮 LLM (GPT-4o) Shadow LLM (GPT-4o mini) Target Document 𝒅∗ System Instruction Generator 𝒢 Private Database 𝒟 Retriever ℛ Ground-truth Answers 𝑮 RAG’s Responses 𝑹 1 𝑛 ෍ 𝕀 ri = gi − 𝜆𝕀[ri = UNK] MIA Score .… .… .… qn q1 q2 Generated Queries 𝑸 .… Query Rewriting Malicious Input Detection Figure 2: Overview of the problem setting and our Interrogation attack. Given black-box access to a RAG system S, the adversary wants to infer membership of a given target document in the RAG’s private database. Our method uses auxiliary LLMs to generate benign queries in the form of natural questions, and uses the correctness of the generated responses as a signal for membership inference test. Probe Question. Next, we generate a set of questions that are highly aligned with the content of 𝑑∗. Drawing inspiration from doc2query tasks in the IR literature, we adopt a few-shot prompting strategy [8] that instructs an LLM to create natural, information- seeking queries based on 𝑑∗.
