As a result of the presence of a sealed outer shell, its obstacle avoidance strategy has been simply “hit and run. ” While this is convenient due to the specific geometry of the spherical robots, it however could pose serious issues when the robots are small and light. For portable spherical robots with on-board cameras, a high-speed collision with a hard surface may damage the robot or the camera. This paper proposes a novel and compact proximity sensor that utilizes passive magnetic field to detect the ferromagnetic obstacles through perturbation of the magnetic field. Compared with the existing works that utilize the Earth’s weak magnetic field as a means of detection, the approach undertaken here seeks to harness the same principle but uses an intelligently designed magnetic assembly. It efficiently amplifies the perturbation and therefore improves the detection performance. The presented method is able to simultaneously determine both the distance and direction of the nearby ferromag- netic obstacles. Both simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the sensing principle and operational performance.
