We observe improvement in perfor- mance across all three datasets. 6.3.1 Number of Questions ( 𝑛). While we use 30 questions as the default for our attack, we vary this number (𝑛) to understand its impact on attack inference. Our evaluations show that the num- ber of questions significantly impacts the attack AUC, with more questions improving performance. As shown in Figure 5, increas- ing the number of questions consistently results in higher AUC values, across all three datasets. Notably, with just 5 questions, the AUC of our attack outperforms the baselines. However, we observe diminishing returns at higher question counts, with AUC improvement stabilizing at a saturation point. This suggests that while adding more questions generally enhances performance, the marginal benefit reduces as the number of questions increases. 6.3.2 Number of Retrieved Documents ( 𝑘). While our attack demon- strates robustness across different retrievers and generator models, certain other aspects of a RAG system, such as the number of docu- ments retrieved as context (𝑘), are not under the adversary’s control. This optimal value of 𝑘 can vary across different tasks and datasets. While we set this hyperparameter to 3 in our experiments, we conduct an ablation study to examine the effect of the number of retrieved documents (𝑘) on the attack AUCs.
