Lewis et al. [23] proposed Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) as a plausible remedy to ground model outputs. RAG involves retriev- ing relevant text from a knowledge base for a given query using a retrieval model. These retrieved documents are then incorporated into the model’s prompt as context, augmenting its knowledge. RAG offers a promising approach to grounding model outputs while en- abling flexible, domain-specific knowledge customization without
