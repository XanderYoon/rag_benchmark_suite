inhibitor of the transformation should therefore protect against the toxicity and ideally be part of the diet. We examined flavonoids ubiquitously expressed in plant foods as one of the best candidates, and found that the subclasses flavones and flavonols suppressed antagonistically the transformation of AhR induced by 1 nM of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, without exhibiting agonistic effects that transform AhR. The antagonistic IC(50) values ranged from 0.14 to 10 microM, close to the physiological levels in human. Generate 30 yes/no questions based on this text.

Topic-Focused Description Generation Task Description: You are tasked with generating a concise and accurate topic-focused description of a document based on its content and title (if provided). The description should: 1. Be a single, short sentence. 2. Focus only on the main topic or subject of the document, avoiding verbs and conclusions. 3. Include important keywords from the document. 4. Avoid referencing the document itself with phrases like "The document discusses, " "The report highlights, " or "This paper investigates. " 5. Output only a short, noun-phrase-like description or topic sentence. Examples: - Instead of: "The report from the Düsseldorf conference highlights advancements in green energy technologies. " - Generate: "Advancements in green energy technologies and discussions at the Düsseldorf conference. " - Instead of: "The document investigates the cyclooxygenase pathway in inflammatory responses. "
