Stealthy Membership Inference for Retrieval-Augmented Generation Ali Naseh∗† University of Massachusetts Amherst Yuefeng Peng∗ University of Massachusetts Amherst Anshuman Suri∗ Northeastern University Harsh Chaudhari Northeastern University Alina Oprea Northeastern University Amir Houmansadr University of Massachusetts Amherst Abstract Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate grounded responses by leveraging ex- ternal knowledge databases without altering model parameters. Although the absence of weight tuning prevents leakage via model parameters, it introduces the risk of inference adversaries exploit- ing retrieved documents in the model’s context. Existing methods for membership inference and data extraction often rely on jail- breaking or carefully crafted unnatural queries, which can be easily detected or thwarted with query rewriting techniques common in RAG systems. In this work, we present Interrogation Attack (IA), a membership inference technique targeting documents in the RAG datastore. By crafting natural-text queries that are answerable only with the target document’s presence, our approach demonstrates successful inference with just 30 queries while remaining stealthy; straightforward detectors identify adversarial prompts from exist- ing methods up to 76× more frequently than those generated by our attack. We observe a 2× improvement in TPR@1%FPR over prior inference attacks across diverse RAG configurations, all while costing less than $0.02 per document inference.
