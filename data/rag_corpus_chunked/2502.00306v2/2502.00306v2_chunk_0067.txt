out independently and in duplicate by two review authors. Consensus between the two opinions was achieved by discussion, or involvement of a third review author. MAIN RESULTS: Five studies met the criteria for inclusion in the review. Two of these were multi-intervention studies where the dietary intervention was one component of a wider programme of prevention, but where data on dietary behaviour change were reported. One of the single intervention studies was concerned with dental caries prevention. The other two concerned general health outcomes. There were no studies concerned with dietary change aimed at preventing tooth erosion. In four out of the five included studies a significant change in dietary behaviour was found for at least one of the primary outcome variables. AUTHORS’ CONCLUSIONS: There is some evidence that one-to-one dietary interventions in the dental setting can change behaviour, although the evidence is greater for interventions aiming to change fruit/vegetable and alcohol consumption than for those aiming to change dietary sugar consumption. There is a need for more studies, particularly in the dental practice setting, as well as greater methodological rigour in the design, statistical analysis and reporting of such studies. Original Question 1: "I am asking about One-to-one dietary interventions and their effectiveness in changing dietary behaviour in a dental setting. Is the effectiveness of dietary interventions on oral health assessed in the text? Please answer with ’Yes, ’ ’No, ’ or ’I don’t know’. " Paraphrased Question 1: "The text inquires whether personalized dietary interventions are effective at altering dietary behaviors within a dental environment. It specifically asks if the impact of these dietary interventions on oral health is evaluated. The appropriate response would be ’I don’t know. ’. " Original Question 2: "I am asking about One-to-one dietary interventions and their effectiveness in changing dietary behaviour in
