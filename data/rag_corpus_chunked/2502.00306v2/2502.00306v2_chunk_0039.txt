on our analysis, the input to GPT-4o for this task is 902 ± 108 tokens on average, and the output is 513 ± 64 tokens on average. Based on these numbers, the cost for this stage is $0.01 per document, taking an average of 6.86 s to run. Description Generation. Similarly, for generating the description of each document, we use GPT-4o. Based on our analysis, the average number of input tokens is 648 ± 108, and the average number of output tokens is 21 ± 5. The cost for generating ground-truth answers is $0.003 per document, taking an average of 0.51 s to run. Ground-Truth Answer Generation. To generate the ground-truth answers, we use GPT-4o-mini. The average number of input tokens for this task is 13, 244 ± 3, 317, and the average number of output tokens is 48 ± 5. The cost for generating ground-truth answers is $0.004 per document, taking an average of 0.48 s to run. Based on these estimates, the total cost for processing each document is $0.017, taking an average of 7.85 s to run. Of course, not all constraints are financial; some may be computational. In such cases, an adversary might opt for non-LLM approaches, such as rule-based question templates or human-in-the-loop systems for question and answer generation, trading flexibility and scale for lower resource demands. All costs are according to the pricing information on OpenAI’s website as of 01/2025. 12 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 MIA Score 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 40%Percentage of Documents NFCorpus Member Non-Member 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 MIA Score 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50%Percentage of Documents SCIDOCS 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 MIA Score 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35%Percentage of Documents TREC-COVID Figure 8:
