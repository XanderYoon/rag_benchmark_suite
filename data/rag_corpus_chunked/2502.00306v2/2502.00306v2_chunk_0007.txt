during training (members) and unseen data (non- members). For instance, many ML models assign higher confidence scores to member data points [46]. MIAs have shown varying degrees of success across different domains, including images and tabular data [4, 46, 47, 55]. However, these successes predominantly rely on parametric outputs (e.g., con- fidence scores, perplexity, or loss values). Such outputs are often inaccessible in RAG systems. Moreover, RAG responses are dynam- ically generated based on content retrieved from external corpora rather than solely from the model’s internal parameters. Thus, previous methods that depend on parametric signals are largely inapplicable. More importantly, the target of MIA in RAG systems specifically relates to whether external documents are retrieved dur- ing inference, rather than inferring knowledge from data seen during training or fine-tuning, rendering existing threat models unsuitable. In addition, earlier conclusions about MIAs may not extend to RAG systems. For example, critical analyses suggest that MIAs are typically ineffective for LLMs [13, 34], with effectiveness potentially increasing only when analyzing entire documents or datasets [32, 41]. However, even though RAG relies on an LLM for generating responses, these limitations do not extend to RAG systems, where exact documents are fetched and integrated into the context, making information extraction potentially more accessible. As a result, existing MI threat models, methodologies, and conclusions designed for parameter-only systems do not readily apply to RAG. 2.3 Privacy Attacks in RAGs Recent research has explored various inference attacks against RAG systems. Anderson et al. [2] developed techniques across different access levels, including a gray-box method using a meta-classifier on model logits and a black-box approach directly querying model membership. Li et al. [26] propose a similarly straightforward ap- proach, where the target document is broken into two parts, with the idea that presence of the target document in
