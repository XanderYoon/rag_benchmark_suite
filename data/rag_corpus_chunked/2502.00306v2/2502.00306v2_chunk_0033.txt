Each plot corresponds to one dataset. Performance drops with increasing 𝑘, but our attack consistently outperforms prior works.

Retrieval rates are high for IA, despite not including an exact copy (or some variant with minimal changes) of the target document in the query. increasing the number of retrieved documents generally decreases the attack’s performance. This drop may result from the RAG gen- erator’s difficulty in handling longer contexts, as more retrieved documents increase the input length for the generator. Despite this decline, our attack consistently outperforms the baselines across all values of 𝑘. It is worth noting that we excluded RAG-MIA from this study, as it does not produce AUC scores for direct comparison. 6.3.3 Distribution of Questions. Prior work shows that social and implicit biases can push LLMs toward generating affirmatively an- swered questions [25]. To measure this tendency, we analyze the distribution of generated questions, ground-truth answers, and the outputs of
