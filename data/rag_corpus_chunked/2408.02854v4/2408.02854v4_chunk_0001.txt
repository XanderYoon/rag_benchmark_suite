concepts and entities, and an inability to reference sources accurately (Barnett et al., 2024; Soudani et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2024). Several approaches have been devel- oped to mitigate the limitations of LLMs, while retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is as of now deemed as one of the most promising (Gao et al., 2024). RAG primarily enhances LLMs by incorpo- rating contextual information during the retrieval process, significantly improving the generated con- tent’s accuracy and consistency. Consequently, RAG improves LLM tasks and applications in var- ious ways, as evidenced by recent studies (Asai et al., 2024; Jiang et al., 2023; Martino et al., 2023). Given its potential, this paper aims to develop a conceptualization for RAG applications, illustrat- ing how RAG can be systematically implemented to improve LLM tasks and applications across var- ious domains. Recent studies, such as those by Asai et al. (2024); Jiang et al. (2023); Martino et al. (2023), have shown various ways in which RAG can enhance LLMs, underscoring its attributes as explainable, scalable, and adaptable in nature (Siri- wardhana et al., 2023). Given this value of RAG for real-world applica- tions, still there is a dearth of systematization of the field. This is particularly evident in surveys, which emphasize technological aspects over practical ap- plications (Zhao et al., 2024). Therefore, we aim to create a taxonomy that conceptualizes a compre- hensive overview of the constituting characteristics that define RAG applications, facilitating the adop- tion of this technology. Current research on RAG is distributed across various disciplines, and since the technology is evolving very quickly, its unit of analysis is mostly on technological innovations, rather than applications in business contexts. To the best of our knowledge, there have not been any holistic RAG application taxonomies. Thus, our research question is as follows: “How can RAG
