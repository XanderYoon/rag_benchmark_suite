examples for each class, therefore, we were able to primarily check the correctness of the identi- fied classes. Furthermore, during iterations, we expected to use a manual paper check to prove the ChatGPT clustering efficiency. 3.4 Iterations We performed four iterations to build our initial RAG application taxonomy. Overall, we analyzed 28 papers, including 4 surveys on RAG, that al- ready performed the extensive analysis and gener- alization of previous works (Li et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2023; Gao et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2024). Those papers already comprise over 2000 citations, resulting in more than twenty-eight papers involved in our study in total. Moreover, a major part of the dimensions was added during the first iteration, where two survey papers were analyzed. Therefore, we consider this number of iterations reasonable, which was also confirmed by meeting the follow- ing objective condition – no new dimensions or 3 characteristics were added, merged, or split in the iteration. Our iterative development process for the RAG application taxonomy, as illustrated by Figure 2 in Appendix A started with an initial set of eleven dimensions, mapped across five meta-dimensions. In this first iteration, the key dimensions of the RAG Phase, Application Domain, Application Task, RAG Process, Paradigm, Retrieval Type, Re- trieval Process, RAG Role, Modality, Evaluation Metrics, and Failures of RAG were established, each annotated with a specific number of charac- teristics indicated by the numbers in parentheses. In the second iteration, we enriched the taxonomy by analyzing seven additional papers, leading to the introduction of three new dimensions: LLM Status, Granularity, and Dataset. Concurrently, we refined several existing dimensions by either merg- ing or adding new characteristics, reflecting deeper insights and broader coverage. By the third iter- ation, only two new dimensions were necessary: Application Architecture and Future Directions, in-
