(2022) provide one of the first survey papers on the topic that covers early works on RAG with application to NLP tasks such as Dialogue Systems, Neural Machine Translation, Paraphrase Generation, Text Style Transfer, etc. In Zhao et al. (2024), the au- thors comprehensively review existing efforts that integrate RAG techniques into AI-generated con- tent scenarios, exhibiting how RAG contributes to current generative models. Gao et al. (2024) contextualize the broader scope of RAG research within the landscape of LLMs. The paper presents various RAG components, datasets, and evaluation setups being the perfect source for both understand- ing the RAG concept as well as delving into the topic. Zhao et al. (2023) specialize in multimodal research for images, videos, code, text, etc. The main idea is to structure our knowledge of RAG by creating a taxonomy for different characteristics of the RAG system in order to make their develop- ment easier for further RAG applications. Classification research and typologies are used for the scientific pursuit of differences to theo- rize about commonalities (Beaulieu et al., 2015). Classification schemes and theories of typologies originate in biology to study and classify species, but have since gained widespread adoption in application-oriented research domains like the in- formation systems community (Nickerson et al., 2013). While sometimes typologies are synony- mous with the term framework, in this paper we will use the term taxonomy to structure the novel technological artifact known as RAG. Thus, we describe our methodology to develop a RAG appli- cation taxonomy following a systematic approach based on Nickerson et al. (2013). 3 Taxonomy Development In this section, we describe the methodology used for developing the taxonomy of RAG. We describe the process of paper selection, as well as the it- erations of the methodology applied. Moreover, we describe the additional approach
