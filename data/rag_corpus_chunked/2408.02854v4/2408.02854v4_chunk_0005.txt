ness, robustness, conciseness, extensibility, and explainability. This is reflected in the adaptation of dimensions throughout the iterations as we joined, reorganized, and split categories. As we tackle a recent and ever-changing phenomenon, we con- clude that an expanded set of dimensions, namely 16, is still useful for research and practice in the current state. Regarding robustness, we checked for a strict separation between dimensions as well as characteristics. Comprehensibility is ensured by our extensive approach. Extensibility and ex- plainability were tackled by repeatedly applying examples to the taxonomy. To start the development process, we choose a twofold approach. First, we used aspects of conceptual-to-empirical to catalyze the initial it- eration (Nickerson et al., 2013). This was done by identifying relevant domains with the help of Chat- GPT. Second, we also incorporated an empirical-to- conceptual approach that specifically used surveys 2 of RAG, as those already provide some cumula- tive knowledge of the field. Still, most are rather new and have not gone through a proper double- blind review process. Thus, in combining both approaches, we propose a new angle to deal with emerging topics. Afterward, we strictly follow the empirical-to-conceptual regime. 3.2 Paper Selection As the object of interest is relatively novel, we employed a naïve approach for identifying and se- lecting papers. As a first step, we started with the search string “RAG & application” at Google Scholar. The results encompassed several articles from the Association of Computational Linguistics, which is a driver of the general development of LLMs, as well as RAG. Thus, we deemed the gen- eral search strategy as useful. Despite high-quality results, most papers are in pre-print status and have not been part of a thorough peer review. Still, we include those, after quality checks by the author team. If articles are perceived as questionable
