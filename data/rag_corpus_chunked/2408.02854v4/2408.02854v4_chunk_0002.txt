of this technology. Current research on RAG is distributed across various disciplines, and since the technology is evolving very quickly, its unit of analysis is mostly on technological innovations, rather than applications in business contexts. To the best of our knowledge, there have not been any holistic RAG application taxonomies. Thus, our research question is as follows: “How can RAG applications be conceptualized in a taxonomy?” Therefore, the main contributions of the paper are as follows: • We present a RAG taxonomy offering a com- prehensive framework to define and cate- gorize the core characteristics of Retrieval- Augmented Generation (RAG) applications, promoting their broader adoption and practi- cal use. • We contribute to taxonomy creation methods within the ACL community by adapting the approach of Nickerson et al. (2013) from the field of Information Systems. 1 arXiv:2408.02854v4 [cs.IR] 18 Feb 2025 • We validate the practical applicability of the created taxonomy by reviewing various papers on RAG applications and also by using the au- tomatic domain classification with ChatGPT. 2 Related Work In this section, we discuss the peculiarities of the current survey before the other survey papers (Zhao et al., 2024; Gao et al., 2024; Li et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2023) and discuss the origins of our taxon- omy creation approach. While there exist already various surveys on RAG, we would like to specify, how the current sur- vey paper is different from others. Li et al. (2022) provide one of the first survey papers on the topic that covers early works on RAG with application to NLP tasks such as Dialogue Systems, Neural Machine Translation, Paraphrase Generation, Text Style Transfer, etc. In Zhao et al. (2024), the au- thors comprehensively review existing efforts that integrate RAG techniques into AI-generated con- tent scenarios, exhibiting how RAG contributes
