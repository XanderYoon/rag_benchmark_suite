RAG systems by analyzing different RAG paradigms—such as naive, advanced, and modular RAG—which reflect varying levels of complex- ity and integration. Additionally, we consider the specific contexts or processes where the RAG re- trieval is realized. In total, the structure includes key characteristics that distinguish RAG systems. D4 Retrieval Process: The retrieval process rep- resents to what extent the RAG uses retrieval. Sin- gle retrieval, multiple retrieval, and adaptive re- trieval are the identified characteristics (Gao et al., 2024). Single retrieval thus solely relies on a single retrieval sequence in a RAG, while multiple re- trieval is an iterative or sequential approach. Adap- tive retrieval is the most contextual approach, as it integrates the results of prior retrieval to adapt the next iteration of retrieval. 4 Dimension Characteristics GeneralStructureDataEvaluationLimitations Phase Application Domain Application Task Retrieval Process Paradigm RAG role LLM status RAG Process Application Architecture Modalities Granularity Dataset Evaluation Metrics RAG Failure Points Future Directions health law biology general AI & NLP ecology educationresearch media sparse-vector retrieval task-specific retrievaldense-vector retrieval QA IE dialog reasoning slot filling MT summary generation other single retrieval adaptive retrievalmultiple retrieval naive RAG modular RAGadvanced RAG complete system subsystem not used used pre-training fine-tuninginference web app local server database testing configuration pre-retrieval retrieval post-retrieval generator post-generation natural language image code structured knowledge audio video pdf html text – fine to coarse (e.g. document, chunk, sentence, phrase, token, proposition) entity, triplet, sub-graph publicly available proprietary datasets retrieval evaluation generation evaluation internal limitations component interaction limitations more advanced research efficient deployment and processing incorporating long-tail and real- time knowledge combination with other techniques Retrieval Type Figure 1: RAG Taxonomy created from twenty-eight papers within four iterations.
