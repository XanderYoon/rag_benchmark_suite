place. It also relates to the evolving discourse – despite being a novel phenomenon. Re- search shows that there are three primary areas of application for RAG. The resulting characteristics are pre-training, inference, and fine-tuning (Gao et al., 2024). D2 Application Domain: In total, eight applica- tion domains are found in the discourse. The most frequent are health, law, biology, general AI and NLP, as well as ecology (Gao et al., 2024). Further application domains are education and research (Barnett et al., 2024) as well as media (Siriward- hana et al., 2023). D3 Application Task: RAG methods can be ap- plied to different applications or downstream tasks. In this dimension, the characteristics are the promi- nent tasks (Gao et al., 2024). We consider eight characteristics, i.e. Question-Answering (QA), In- formation Extraction (IE), Dialog, Reasoning, Slot Filling (Glass et al., 2021), Machine Translation (Li et al., 2022), Summarization (Zhao et al., 2024), others. QA has several different types, e.g. open domain QA, abstractive QA (Lewis et al., 2020), GraphQA (He et al., 2024), etc. Other contains some other tasks, for example, Fact Checking/Veri- fication, Question Generation (Lewis et al., 2020), Code search (Gao et al., 2024), and many more. 4.2 Structure This includes an examination of the underlying technologies that form the architecture of the RAG application, determining whether the RAG acts as the principal system or merely a component within a larger system. We further delineate the struc- ture of RAG systems by analyzing different RAG paradigms—such as naive, advanced, and modular RAG—which reflect varying levels of complex- ity and integration. Additionally, we consider the specific contexts or processes where the RAG re- trieval is realized. In total, the structure includes key characteristics that distinguish RAG systems. D4 Retrieval Process: The retrieval process rep- resents to what extent the RAG
