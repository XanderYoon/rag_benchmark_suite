D5 Paradigm: Gao et al. (2024) categorize the RAG research paradigm into three Naive RAG, Advanced RAG, and Modular RAG. In this dimen- sion, these three categories are the characteristics. In Naive RAG, there are three parts, i.e., indexing, retrieval, and generation. Advance RAG also in- cludes pre-retrieval and post-retrieval parts before and after retrieval. Modular RAG provides flexi- bility with different modules, e.g., search module, memory module, etc. D6 RAG Role: Within the application landscape, the role of RAG systems can vary significantly: they can operate as dedicated, monolithic systems or as modular components integrated within other application systems (Zhao et al., 2024). According to the authors, subsystems can be part of larger architectures that employ multiple frameworks, i.e. RetDream for 3D Generation (Seo et al., 2024), R- ConvED for video captioning (Chen et al., 2023), and kNN-TRANX (Zhang et al., 2023) for text- to-code tasks. In the above-mentioned systems, RAG is used as an additional step to the pipeline, enhancing generation with the retrieved data. 5 D7 LLM Status: This dimension is binary, it checks for the adaptability of the LLM in place. So it can either be not used, meaning no further ap- proach is taken to improve the LLM performance, or it can be used (Chen et al., 2024). Used thus leads to different forms. It can be trainable to be adjusted in each context or it can be looped as a specification of the paradigm modular RAG. D8 RAG Process: In this dimension, processes in RAG models are discussed mostly based on the information by Gao et
