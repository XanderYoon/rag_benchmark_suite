contains models based mostly on low-dimensional dense vectors, e.g., BERT-encoders, and relying often on vector databases. In task-specific retrieval, the re- trieval module is based on task (Li et al., 2022) and might comprise a database (Radeva et al., 2024). Some research works directly using the edit dis- tance between natural language texts (Hayati et al., 2018) or abstract syntax trees (AST) of code snip- pets (Poesia et al., 2022). D10 Application Architecture: When develop- ing a RAG system, in addition to the RAG struc- ture, we also need to consider the structure of the final application and the interaction of the com- ponents. (Radeva et al., 2024) present a web ap- plication RAG system that consists of the “local or server-based installation”, “web application”, “vector storage” (database), as well as the testing and configurations. Therefore, this dimension com- prises the web app, local server, database, testing, and configuration characteristics. 4.3 Data D11 Modalities: Although the concept of RAG was originally developed for text-based generation, its use has been adapted for a variety of other gen- eration modalities (Chen et al., 2024; Gao et al., 2024; Lewis et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2024). This includes programming code, audio, visual content, such as images and videos, 3D models, and other knowledge structures. The latter can include ta- ble structures, higher-level modeling languages, graphs, textual graphs (He et al., 2024), or knowl- edge graphs. The fundamental principles of RAG remain similar across these different modalities, even though slight modifications to the augmenta- tion methods are sometimes required. D12 Granularity: This dimension is for differ- ent granularities of retrieved data based on the in- formation by Gao et al. (2024). The modality can be natural language (or text), yet still, the retrieved granularity might vary from fine to coarse, e.g., document, chunk,
