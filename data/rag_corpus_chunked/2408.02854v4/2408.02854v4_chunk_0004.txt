describe our methodology to develop a RAG appli- cation taxonomy following a systematic approach based on Nickerson et al. (2013). 3 Taxonomy Development In this section, we describe the methodology used for developing the taxonomy of RAG. We describe the process of paper selection, as well as the it- erations of the methodology applied. Moreover, we describe the additional approach for identifying the domains where RAG was applied – an analysis of papers found with specific queries in Google Scholar and ACL Anthology using ChatGPT. 3.1 Methodology Following the approach of Nickerson et al. (2013), we defined our meta-characteristic as “structure and applications of retrieval augmented genera- tion”. In doing so, we included conceptual work and case studies that aimed at specific application domains or use cases. Due to the high dynamic in the research area, we also included pre-print arti- cles. To ensure minimal quality standards, we re- viewed each article by two independent researchers. To define a level of saturation, we used the objec- tive and subjective ending conditions as proposed by Nickerson et al. (2013). So, we examined a representative sample of the most recent literature, and those dimensions were stable for an iteration. Thus, no extensions, merges, or splits of charac- teristics were performed. We also ensured that dimensions have at least one characteristic, and those are directly derived from papers while being unique. Subjective ending conditions were consid- ered as proposed. We aimed for comprehensive- ness, robustness, conciseness, extensibility, and explainability. This is reflected in the adaptation of dimensions throughout the iterations as we joined, reorganized, and split categories. As we tackle a recent and ever-changing phenomenon, we con- clude that an expanded set of dimensions, namely 16, is still useful for research and practice in the current state. Regarding robustness, we checked for a
