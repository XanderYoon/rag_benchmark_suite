iteration, we enriched the taxonomy by analyzing seven additional papers, leading to the introduction of three new dimensions: LLM Status, Granularity, and Dataset. Concurrently, we refined several existing dimensions by either merg- ing or adding new characteristics, reflecting deeper insights and broader coverage. By the third iter- ation, only two new dimensions were necessary: Application Architecture and Future Directions, in- dicating a nearing saturation in the scope of the tax- onomy. Adjustments were made to five dimensions during this phase, demonstrating a trend toward the stabilization of the taxonomy’s structure. The fourth iteration confirmed the saturation, as no new changes were made to the taxonomy, suggesting that the existing structure sufficiently captured the relevant aspects of RAG applications as evidenced by the literature. Across all iterations, the taxon- omy has evolved to accommodate and anticipate the dynamic nature of RAG applications, ensuring its relevance and utility in future research. 4 Results In this section, we present the final RAG taxon- omy created from twenty-eight papers in four it- erations. Figure 1 illustrates the entire taxonomy divided into five main components. In the follow- ing subsections, we describe each component in more detail. 4.1 General The first group of dimensions is devoted to gen- eral aspects of RAG systems, regardless of specific structural aspects. Within this group, we identified three dimensions to represent the general aim and motivation of applied RAG. D1 Phase: The dimension subsumes the focus of RAG in place. It also relates to the evolving discourse – despite being a novel phenomenon. Re- search shows that there are three primary areas of application for RAG. The resulting characteristics are pre-training, inference, and fine-tuning (Gao et al., 2024). D2 Application Domain: In total, eight applica- tion domains are found in the discourse. The most frequent are health, law, biology,
