which is a driver of the general development of LLMs, as well as RAG. Thus, we deemed the gen- eral search strategy as useful. Despite high-quality results, most papers are in pre-print status and have not been part of a thorough peer review. Still, we include those, after quality checks by the author team. If articles are perceived as questionable by one of the researchers, we employed a cross-check by at least another researcher on the team. Also, we excluded published work with publishers that do not comply with the minimal standards of our research community. Due to the iterative approach taken, we reviewed twenty-eight papers in the taxonomy development process. While 20 papers have been reviewed and published in several venues, 8 papers are still in pre-print phase. However, we need to emphasize that all 8 papers were written in 2024 which means that they still can be accepted in the future. 3.3 ChatGPT Domain Identification To facilitate the time-consuming process of paper analysis, we decided to apply it for identifying the application domains and further compare the out- come to see, whether such an automated technique applies to the taxonomy construction. First, we created two queries for Google Scholar – a large search system for academic papers1. The first query “application of rag” for the papers dating from 2023 (anywhere in the article) returned ninety-three re- sults. The “rag application” query from 2023 (any- where in the article) returned seventy-four papers. Additionally, we searched these two queries in ACL Anthology2, and the first one returned two results, while five results are returned with the second one. 1All searches are done on a date, 11.09.2024 2https://aclanthology.org/ Then, inspired by Rafailov et al. (2023), we cre- ated a prompt to ChatGPT to cluster the extracted papers into domains. We formulated
