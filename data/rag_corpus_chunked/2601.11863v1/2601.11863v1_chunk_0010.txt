text. The fields are serialized into a fixed-order header for text-based vari- ants, and passed verbatim to the metadata encoder for dual-encoder variants. We evaluate retrieval quality using cosine similarity with top-Ksearch, vary- ingK∈ {1, . . . ,10}. Performance is measured against ground-truth supporting chunks using four metrics: – Context@K: whether at least one retrieved chunk within the topKsup- ports the ground-truth answer. – Title@K: whether at least one top-Kchunk comes from the correct docu- ment (company and year). – Average Matched Rank: the mean rank position of the highest-ranked supporting chunk (lower is better).

Fig.4: Comparative retrieval performance vs. plain baseline across query types using Metadata as Text (Prefix) – Retrieval Failure Rate: the proportion of queries for which no relevant chunk is retrieved (lower is better). 5 Findings Our experiments show that metadata-aware retrieval consistently improves over a plain content-only baseline. Among the strategies, two stand out: prefix-based metadata-as-text (MaT) and dual-encoder unified embeddings. Unified embeddings emerge as the most effective and practical approach. By fusing metadata and content vectors into a single index, they achieve accu- racy that matches or surpasses prefixing while offering clear advantages in index maintenance and serving. This makes unified embeddings a strong candidate for deployment in real-world RAG systems where metadata evolves over time. At the same time, metadata-as-text remains a simple and high-performing baseline. Direct concatenation reliably boosts retrieval accuracy and requires no architectural changes or additional infrastructure, making it appealing as a training-free baseline.
