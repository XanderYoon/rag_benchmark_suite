metadata, many chunks across dif- ferent companies, years, and sections contain nearly identical language, causing semantic-only retrievers to return plausible but incorrect context. Metadata such as company, fiscal year, and section title disambiguate the query intent, anchor- ing retrieval to the correct filing and section. SEC filings have therefore become a common testbed for financial QA with LLMs [19,20,7], alongside broader benchmarks in finance [31,10]. Together, thesestudieshighlightboththeopportunitiesandthelimitationsofRAGpipelines on repetitive, domain-specific corpora. Motivated by recent work in contextual fine-tuning and long-context prompting [1,5], we ask: Utilizing Metadata for Better Retrieval-Augmented Generation 3 (a) Plain text index (b) Metadata as part of text (c) Dual encoder (unified index) (d) Dual encoder (late fusion) Fig.2: Conceptual overview of document and metadata embedding strategies for retrieval. Dotted arrows indicate query propagation. Can metadata be utilized as a first-class input in RAG pipelines, not just as a filter, but as embedded content that improves retrieval quality and downstream answer correctness? We investigate whether metadata-aware retrieval benefits from more modular designs such as dual encoders that embed content and metadata separately, or query reformulation that explicitly surfaces metadata cues. As a simple baseline, we also evaluate adding metadata directly to the chunk as text. In particular, prefixing metadata before the chunk yields strong retrieval accuracy, though it is computationally expensive since any metadata update requires re-embedding the full index. To make maintenance lighter, we propose a dual-encoder framework in which metadata and content are embedded independently and then combined. Metadata embeddings only need to be computed once per field and can be fused with precomputed text embeddings, avoiding costly re-embedding of the full corpus. Among these variants, unified embeddings, where metadata and content vectors are summed into a single index, achieve accuracy comparable to, and sometimes surpassing, prefixing while simplifying serving. In contrast, late-fusion scoring is
