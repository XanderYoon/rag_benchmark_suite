metadata evolves over time. At the same time, metadata-as-text remains a simple and high-performing baseline. Direct concatenation reliably boosts retrieval accuracy and requires no architectural changes or additional infrastructure, making it appealing as a training-free baseline. Late-fusiondualencodersandmetadata-awarequeryreformulationtrailthese methods. Sweeping the fusion weightα∈ {0.0,0.1, . . . ,1.0}shows moderate val- ues (α≈0.3−0.6) work best, confirming that metadata should complement, not dominate, content signals. In practice, late fusion offers little advantage: uni- fied embeddings provide similar balance within a single index, avoiding extra 10 Yousuf et al.
