Metadata improves results when moderately weighted; full reliance on either content or metadata reduces performance. Across both embedding models, OpenAI’stext-embedding-3-small(1536- dim) and BAAI’sbge-m3(1024-dim), the metadata-enriched strategies consis- Utilizing Metadata for Better Retrieval-Augmented Generation 11 Fig.6: Embedding space analysis with unified embeddings (grouped intra-/inter- document similarities) tently outperform the plain baseline. The gains are most pronounced for complex queries that require company- or section-level disambiguation. Figures 1,3 and 4 visualize these comparative performance trends across query types. Table 2 reports representative metrics atk=5, providing a compact numerical view of the performance differences across methods. These headline results set the stage for deeper analyses of trade-offs and ablations in the following sections. 5.1 Analysis of Embedding Space We test Propositions 1–3 by computing pairwise cosine similarities under both metadata-as-text (MaT) and unified embeddings (Eq. 1). For each pair of chunks weformtwosimilarities,plaincos(e i,e j)andmetadata-enrichedcos( ˜eMaT i , ˜eMaT j ) orcos( ˜eUnif i , ˜eUnif j ). We stratify pairs into Same Company & Year (positive) and Different (negative), and quantify separation. Below we report results for the dual-encoder unified embeddings; the MaT variant shows similar trends. Metadata increases similarity across all strata but especially for positive pairs, widening the gap. For example, the mean margin between positives and negatives triples (0.054→0.152), Cohen’sdgrows from a small effect (0.45) to a very large one (2.25), and AUC rises from 0.63 to 0.94.
