heavy lexical repetition, and subtle document-level distinctions that fre- quently confound semantic-only retrieval. While absolute gains may vary across domains, these worst-case conditions allow us to isolate the effect of metadata integration, and we expect the relative benefits of treating metadata as a first- class retrieval signal, particularly via unified embeddings, to generalize to other structured corpora such as scientific articles, legal records, and technical manu- als. Ground-truth answers were generated in a semi-supervised manner, a limi- tation that nevertheless reflects the common practice of using LLMs as judges or oracles [34,13,23,16,18]. In addition, we evaluate frozen encoders without exploring fine-tuning or end-to-end training. Overall, our results suggest that effective metadata integration does not re- quirecomplexarchitectures:concatenationorunifiedfusionalreadyofferastrong balance of accuracy and practicality. Future directions include adaptive weight- ing, richer metadata modalities (tables, figures), and human evaluation of down- stream generation quality.
