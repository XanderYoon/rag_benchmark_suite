The advent of attention-based mod- els [30,12] and modern chat-based LLMs [29,4] has made retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) [22] a central paradigm. While standalone LLMs often halluci- nate, which is problematic in high-stakes domains such as medicine [33], law [28], intelligence analysis [32], and software engineering [21], RAG mitigates this by grounding generation in external knowledge. Approaches span both fine-tuned retrievers [25,5] and retraining-free pipelines that dominate current practice [15, 11]. Within retrieval itself, methods differ in how they represent knowledge: some embed raw document chunks [15], others use (question, answer) pairs [35], and some generate synthetic queries or summaries to improve matching [14,6,26]. These span dense embedding approaches and sparse, keyword-based retrieval. Recent work such as EnrichIndex [9] further explores offline LLM-based enrich- ment by generating summaries, purposes, and synthetic QA pairs to strengthen first-stage retrieval without online LLM costs. Most prior work leverages metadata only indirectly, either for filtering or throughlate-fusionsignals.FinancialQAbenchmarkssuchasFinanceBench[19], SEC-QA [20], and SecQue [7], along with broader datasets in finance [31,10], highlight the challenges of repetitive, domain-specific corpora but stop short of systematically evaluating metadata integration. While some recent approaches enrich documents with additional LLM-generated semantic context, they do not isolate the role of structured metadata as a retrieval signal. Our work differs by treating metadata as a first-class retrieval signal, comparing simple metadata- as-text strategies with modular dual-encoder designs. 3 Metadata as a First-Class Signal We begin with the simplest approach to metadata integration: concatenating structured metadata fields directly to the chunk text before embedding. This Utilizing Metadata for Better Retrieval-Augmented Generation 5 technique treats metadata as
