(a) General questions (b) In-depth questions Fig.1: Context@K and Title@K metric improvement in retrieval when using and not using metadata across query types (Dual Encoder Unified Embeddings) unstructured corpora [29,4]. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architec- tures extend these models by first retrieving relevant context and then con- ditioning generation on it [22]. This hybrid setup has become the dominant paradigm for open-domain question answering, long-document understanding, and domain-specific inference [15,11]. However, RAG pipelines are only as reliable as the context they retrieve. When document corpora are repetitive or semantically ambiguous, such as reg- ulatory filings, legal records, or scientific papers, retrievers often return super- ficially relevant but substantively unhelpful chunks [15,28]. In these settings, small differences in document structure or entity context (for example company name, fiscal year, or section title) become essential for retrieving the correct information. A particularly illustrative case is the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commis- sion (SEC) Form 10-K filings. These documents follow rigid templates, reuse language across companies and years, and contain subtle, structure-dependent variations. Such properties challenge traditional vector-based retrieval, which re- liesonchunk-levelsemanticembeddings[12,15]thatoftenlacksufficientdiscrim- inative power. Many of the disambiguating signals already exist in structured metadata such as filing year, form type, section heading, and industry classifi- cation, yet these fields are usually applied only for post-retrieval filtering [35]. For example, consider the query “What risks does the company identify re- lated to supply chain disruptions?” Without metadata, many chunks across dif- ferent companies, years, and sections contain nearly identical language, causing semantic-only retrievers to return plausible but incorrect context. Metadata such as company, fiscal year, and section title disambiguate the query intent, anchor- ing retrieval to the correct filing and section. SEC filings have therefore become a common testbed for financial QA with LLMs [19,20,7], alongside
