a chunk within its broader structure. To test their contributions, we compare four conditions: i) No Metadata (Baseline): plain chunk text without metadata; ii) Full Metadata: all fields, including section titles; iii) w/o section: Full metadata except section titles. iv) w/o company and year: Full metadata except company and year. All embeddings use OpenAI’stext-embedding-3-smallmodel with the MaT formulation, and retrieval is evaluated with the metrics from Section 4, focusing on Context@K and Title@K. Figures 7a and 7b report the results. Company and year provide the strongest disambiguating signal: removing them reduces both Title@K and Context@K. In contrast, removing section titles yields only a modest drop in Context@K with no effect on Title@K, suggesting that global identifiers drive document- level accuracy while section cues primarily aid chunk-level localization. 7 Conclusion, Limitations, and Future Work We revisited the role of metadata as a first-class retrieval signal in RAG, using SECfilingsasatestbed.Acrosstwoembeddingmodels,wefoundthatembedding metadata alongside content consistently improves retrieval. Simple prefixing of Utilizing Metadata for Better Retrieval-Augmented Generation 13 metadata is strong, but a dual-encoder with unified embeddings matches or exceeds its accuracy while being easier to maintain. Field-level ablations show that company and year act as strong disambiguators, while section titles are only modestly useful, and embedding-space analysis reveals that metadata improves geometry by tightening intra-document similarity and reducing cross-document confusion. We also acknowledge limitations. Our study focuses on SEC Form 10-K fil- ings, a deliberately challenging stress-test corpus characterized by rigid tem- plates, heavy lexical repetition, and subtle document-level distinctions that fre- quently confound semantic-only retrieval. While absolute gains may vary across domains, these worst-case conditions allow us to isolate the effect of metadata integration, and we expect the relative benefits of treating metadata as a first- class retrieval signal, particularly via unified embeddings, to generalize to other structured corpora such as scientific
