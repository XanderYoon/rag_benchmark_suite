Fig.7: Impact of metadata ablations on retrieval performance Table 3 shows, both metadata strategies yield large gains over plain embeddings, with unified embeddings outperforming prefixing on majority of all metrics while being easier to maintain. 6 Impact of Metadata Fields: Ablation Study Not all metadata fields contribute equally to retrieval performance. Here we focus on two types of signals: global identifiers such as company and year, and local context from section titles. Chunks extracted from long, repetitive documents like SEC filings often lose their contextual anchor. For example, the phrase “we believe our strategy is working” has very different implications in a “Risk Factors” section versus in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis.” We distinguish two types of context: i) global, provided by fields such as company and year that identify the document as a whole, and ii) local, provided by fields such as section titles that situate a chunk within its broader structure. To test their contributions, we compare four conditions: i) No Metadata (Baseline): plain chunk text without metadata; ii) Full Metadata: all fields, including section titles; iii) w/o section: Full metadata except section titles. iv) w/o company and year: Full metadata except company and year.
