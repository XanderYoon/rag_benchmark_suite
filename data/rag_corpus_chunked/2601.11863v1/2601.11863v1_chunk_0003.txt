and then combined. Metadata embeddings only need to be computed once per field and can be fused with precomputed text embeddings, avoiding costly re-embedding of the full corpus. Among these variants, unified embeddings, where metadata and content vectors are summed into a single index, achieve accuracy comparable to, and sometimes surpassing, prefixing while simplifying serving. In contrast, late-fusion scoring is less competitive. Beyond empirical comparisons, we also analyze why metadata integration improves retrieval. Through statistical analysis of embedding spaces, we show that metadata increases intra-document cohesion, decreases inter-document con- fusion, and expands the variance of similarity scores, creating a more discrimina- tive geometry for retrieval. This analysis confirms that metadata does not simply add tokens but reshapes the embedding landscape in a way that improves sepa- rability between relevant and irrelevant chunks. We summarize our contributions as follows: –To our knowledge, the first systematic study showing that metadata signals significantly improve retrieval on RAG systems. –A dual-encoder framework that embeds metadata and content separately, improving index maintenance while achieving accuracy on par with, and sometimes better than, prefixing. 4 Yousuf et al. –Astatisticalembedding-spaceanalysisthatexplainsthesegains,demonstrat- ing increased intra-document cohesion, reduced inter-document confusion, and clearer separation between relevant and irrelevant chunks. –Field-level ablations show that company and year fields provide strong dis- ambiguating signals, while section titles offer more modest gains. –ReleaseofRAGMATE-10K,ametadata-richbenchmarkwithchunkgrounded QA for reproducible evaluation. We review related work (§2), introduce metadata-as-text and dual-encoder de- signs (§3.2), describe theRAGMATE-10Kdataset and setup (§4), present re- sults (§5), analyze embedding geometry (§5.1), report ablations on section titles (§6), and conclude with limitations and future work. 2 Related Work Information access has long motivated technologies from search engines [27,8] to diverse downstream applications [17,24]. The advent of attention-based mod- els [30,12] and modern chat-based LLMs [29,4] has made retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) [22] a central paradigm.
