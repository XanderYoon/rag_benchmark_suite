[22, 57, 82] and access well-curated databases [66]. For example, [46, 59, 66] incorporate the symbolic knowledge in the form of structured triples from the knowledge graph to 1) enhance the faithfulness of LLMs’ answers, 2) enable the knowledge evolution via dynamic editing, and 3) provide in- terpretability for LLMs’ responses. Unfortunately, most of these KG-enhanced RAGs have been exclusively deployed for question- answering tasks [43, 59, 66], with a limited exploration in text gen- eration tasks. More importantly, while these methods incorporate neighborhood information from knowledge graphs, they neglect two fundamental knowledge encoded in the topological pattern, proximity-based knowledge [ 21, 54, 81] (e.g., nodes that can be mutually reached via only few-hops walks) and role-based knowl- edge [1, 51, 53] (i.e., nodes with similar local subgraph structures). For example, in Figure 1(a), when writing the abstract of a paper (node 1), having access to its cited papers in its related work section (nodes 2-4) could greatly enhance writing efficiency, because these referenced papers likely possess knowledge and narrative styles akin to the paper being authored. Likewise, in Figure 1(b), employ- ees holding comparable positions in a company, like managers 2 and 3, typically share similar job responsibilities and analogous communication styles in their emails. Understanding the email con- tent and job responsibilities of one manager can provide insights into the role and communication style of the other manager. Given the overlook of the above two fundamental topological relations in current RAGs, we bridge the connection between topo- logical and textual relations, and study their potential in enhancing RAGs for text generation. Our empirical analysis reveals the positive relation between the nodes’ textual relations and their topological relations, which inspires us to explore the idea of augmenting text generation by incorporating topological relations. To validate the feasibility of this
