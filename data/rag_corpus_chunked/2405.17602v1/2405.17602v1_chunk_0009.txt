= 𝜙Topo(𝑣𝑖, 𝑣 𝑗 ), then incorporating those topologically-similar sequences would benefit the generation of the current texts. Verifying the above hypothesis requires answering the following two questions: • 𝑸1: Would the text generation with a pre-trained large language model benefit from providing texts that have higher textual simi- larity to the current text to be generated? • 𝑸2: Is there any correlation between the textual similarity of two sequences and the topological similarity of their corresponding nodes? Next, we address 𝑸1 by empirically demonstrating the perfor- mance increase when providing additional texts with increasing textual similarity to the target text (Figure 3 in Section 3). We ad- dress 𝑸2 by formally introducing two types of topological similarity, proximity-based one and structure-based one, and analyzing their correlations to textual similarity (Figure 4/5 in Section 4). Success- fully answering these two questions would motivate the proposal of our framework Topology-aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation (TopoRAG). 3 WOULD TEXT GENERATION BENEFIT FROM PROVIDING ADDITIONAL TEXTS? To address the first research question 𝑸1, we compute the topologi- cal similarity between the target node designated for text generation and all other nodes using their proximity-based topological embed- ding according to Eq (3). Then, we rank all other nodes based on the topological similarity to the target node, iteratively select three consecutive nodes from the ranked list (ranging from positions 𝑘 to 𝑘 + 3), and incorporate their texts as supplementary context to enhance the text generation. Figure 3 shows the generation perfor- mance of paper abstracts on Cora as we sequentially increase the topological rank of the selected additional nodes. Firstly, compared with solely based on its partially observed starting words (horizontal line), the text generation performance is better when including nodes that are among the Top 6. This finding highlights the benefits of incorporating additional
