{𝑆𝑖 }𝑚 𝑖=1 consists of sequences with texts that are only par- tially observable. As the objective of many text-generation applica- tions is to generate complete texts based on the first few pre-existing words/sentences, the "partially observed texts" in this paper refer to the initial words provided in a sequence. Let the partially observed text be 𝑋𝑖 for 𝑖th sequence and its unobserved counterpart be 𝑌𝑖. We aim to leverage LLMs F to generate the sequence b𝑌𝑖 utilizing the information from input 𝑋𝑖, other fully observed texts in SFull 1Similar observation is also found when analyzing their sent emails in Figure 7 in Appendix A.1. and their topological relations in𝐺, with the expectation to recover the ground-truth sequence 𝑌𝑖: b𝑌𝑖 = F (Ω(𝑋𝑖, SFull, 𝐺)), ∀𝑖 ∈ { 1, 2, ..., 𝑚}. (1) Comparing with solely relying on the partially observed text 𝑋𝑖 for the generation, i.e., b𝑌𝑖 = F (𝑋𝑖 ), Eq. (1) leverages Ω to further retrieve the additional sequences from SFull based on the topolog- ical knowledge in the graph structure 𝐺. The general hypothesis here is that for each pair of two textual sequences 𝑆𝑖, 𝑆𝑗 and their corresponding nodes 𝑣𝑖, 𝑣 𝑗 in the graph, if 1) the text generation of LLMs can benefit from providing extra texts that are similar to the target text and 2) the textual similarity 𝜙Text 𝑖 𝑗 = 𝜙Text(𝑆𝑖, 𝑆𝑗 ) is correlated to their topological similarity𝜙Topo 𝑖 𝑗 = 𝜙Topo(𝑣𝑖, 𝑣 𝑗 ), then incorporating those topologically-similar sequences would benefit the generation of the current texts. Verifying the above hypothesis requires answering the following two questions: • 𝑸1: Would the text generation with a pre-trained large language model benefit from providing texts that have higher textual simi- larity to the current text to be generated? • 𝑸2: Is
