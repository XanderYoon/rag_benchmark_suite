setting used for Figure 2(c), we visualize the textual similarity of emails sent by any pair of employees and fur- ther group them based on their job titles. Similar to the observation in Figure 2(c), we can see that people sharing the same job titles have similar textual patterns in their sent emails. A.2 Additional Correlation Analysis Here we conduct additional correlation analysis to demonstrate the positive correlation between proximity-based topological similarity and textual similarity. We can see a consistent positive correlation Conference’17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Figure 8: Correlation analysis between the textual similarity and proximity-based topological similarity over six datasets. The correlation shown beside the name of the dataset is con- sistently positive across different datasets from different domains. across six datasets from citation and E-commerce domains. This further justifies why TopoRAG achieves almost consistently higher performance than other baselines on all these datasets.
