Figure 3 shows the generation perfor- mance of paper abstracts on Cora as we sequentially increase the topological rank of the selected additional nodes. Firstly, compared with solely based on its partially observed starting words (horizontal line), the text generation performance is better when including nodes that are among the Top 6. This finding highlights the benefits of incorporating additional texts in augmenting the current text generation. Secondly, by gradually increasing the rank of nodes we select, the performance gradually decreases according to BertScore-F1, demonstrating that the benefit of including additional texts is correlated to the similarity of those texts to the target one, answering 𝑸1. Conference’17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Figure 3: Comparing text generation between the scenario "Addition" where we include additional texts based on their proximity-based topological similarity to the target node and the scenario "None" where we include no additional texts but only based on its partially observed starting words. 4 IS TOPOLOGICAL SIMILARITY CORRELATED TO TEXTUAL SIMILARITY? Assuming the topological similarity𝜙Topo and the textual similarity 𝜙Text are two random variables where their specific realizations correspond to their values for a specific pair of nodes, then their Pearson correlation is computed as: 𝑟 = 𝑁 2 Í𝑁 ,𝑁 𝑖,𝑗 =1 𝜙Text 𝑖 𝑗 𝜙Topo 𝑖 𝑗 − Í𝑁 ,𝑁 𝑖,𝑗 =1 𝜙Text 𝑖 𝑗 Í𝑁 ,𝑁 𝑖,𝑗 =1 𝜙Topo 𝑖 𝑗√︄ [𝑁 2 Í𝑁 ,𝑁 𝑖,𝑗 =1 (𝜙Text 𝑖 𝑗 ) 2 − ( Í𝑁 ,𝑁 𝑖,𝑗 =1 𝜙Text 𝑖 𝑗 )2 ] [𝑁 2 Í𝑁 ,𝑁 𝑖,𝑗 =1 (𝜙Topo 𝑖 𝑗 ) 2 − ( Í𝑁 ,𝑁 𝑖,𝑗 =1 𝜙Topo 𝑖 𝑗 )2 ] , (2) where 𝜙Text 𝑖 𝑗 = 𝜙Text(𝑆𝑖, 𝑆𝑗 ) is defined as the semantic similarity and it is computed as the cosine similarity of textual embeddings from sentence-transformer. 𝜙Topo
