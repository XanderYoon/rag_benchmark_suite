refers to augmenting the performance of generative-based tasks via retrieving relevant in- formation from external knowledge bases [9, 12, 23, 28, 33, 37, 39]. Conventionally, RAG is widely used in enhancing the performance of question-answering tasks by retrieving supporting facts includ- ing the answer to the given question [ 31, 33, 42, 69]. With the advent of LLMs, RAG gained more proliferation due to its capa- bility to remedy the disadvantages of LLMs, such as mitigating the hallucination issue [2, 71, 77], enhancing interpretability [11], and enabling dynamic knowledge evolution of LLMs [40, 66]. Sig- nificant research efforts have recently been devoted to improving RAG through developing better retrieval methods [61, 64, 66, 75] or incorporating knowledge bases of various modalities [ 32, 36]. Following the former research trend, we enhance RAG retrieval methods by equipping it with topology awareness. Different from KG-based RAG where topology information is incorporated by re- trieving triples from subgraphs around entities mentioned in the question [66], we explicitly consider proximity and role-based topo- logical relations in guiding the retrieval, the related works of which are reviewed next. 7.2 Proximity/Role-based Topological Relations Real-world entities often exhibit interconnected relationships that can be classified into two primary categories: proximity-based and structural-based relationships [1, 10, 53, 54, 56]. Proximity-based relationships between two nodes focus on their topological proxim- ity, such as friends/relatives in social networks, co-cited academic papers in citation networks, and products co-purchased by the same customer [1, 14, 20, 81]. On the other hand, structural-based relations focus on the topological similarity between the local sub- structures of two nodes, e.g., two employees possessing the same title in a company share similar job responsibilities or airports acting as hubs following specific airline patterns [8, 51]. Previous works design various embedding-based methods capturing these two topological patterns. Methods
