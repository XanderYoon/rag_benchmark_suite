(a): in Cora, as the topologi- cal distance between two paper nodes decreases, their textual similarity increases. (b): the Pearson correlations across dif- ferent datasets are all positive and increase as the number of diffusion layer 𝑘 in Eq. (3) increases. other nodes in this graph. However, directly performing this diffu- sion requires O (𝐾 𝑁3) for time and O (𝑁 2) for space complexity. To make this computation scalable [5], we further project the unique node label matrix I via random gaussian projection by replacing I ∈ R𝑁 ×𝑁 with R ∈ R𝑁 ×𝑑 ∼ N ( 0𝑑, 𝚺𝑑 ) with 𝑑 << 𝑁 , which effectively reduces the time/space complexity to O (𝐾 𝑁2𝑑)/O (𝑁𝑑 ). Then the topological similarity between two nodes is computed as the cosine similarity between their corresponding propagated node embeddings, i.e., 𝜙Topo 𝑖,𝑗 = cos(P𝑖, P𝑗 ). To verify the correlation between the proximity-based topologi- cal similarity and textual similarity, we conduct correlation analysis on datasets in Figure 4. On Cora dataset, we run diffusion accord- ing to Eq. (3), obtain node embeddings P, calculate the pairwise topological similarity, and visualize it along with the pairwise tex- tual similarity in Figure 4(a) 2. We can see the pairwise textual similarity increases as the pairwise topological similarity increases. Moreover, we calculate the Pearson correlation across different datasets at different diffusion layers 𝑘 in Eq. (3) in Figure 4(b). In all six datasets, the correlation is positive and increases
