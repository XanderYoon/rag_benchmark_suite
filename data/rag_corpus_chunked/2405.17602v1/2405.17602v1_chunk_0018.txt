apply the GraphSAGE sampling with the number of neighbors [2, 2] across two layers. Since Arxiv provides the publication time of each paper [25], we use the same preprocessing as Cora/Pubmed but follow the chrono- logical order, imitating the real scenarios where users are writing papers with references to historical papers. • Book, Epinion, Music, Pantry [4, 6, 25, 45, 79]: In digital e- commerce networks, each node represents a review and two reviews have an edge if they are either written by the same cus- tomer or posted on the same product. Considering the vast scale of the Book dataset, which encompasses 27,161,262 reviews, we only take the latest 1% reviews to construct the graph. We exclude any review whose length falls below 100 characters. We adhere to the same data splitting ratio used in Cora/Pubmed/Arxiv fol- lowing the chronological order when the review was generated. • Products [25]: Amazon product co-purchasing network where nodes represent products sold in Amazon and edges between two products indicate the co-purchase behaviors. Following Arxiv, we randomly select 0.1% among all product nodes as seeds and apply a GraphSAGE-based neighborhood sampling, with the number of neighbors [2, 2] across two layers. Different from [25] using the sales ranking to split nodes, we randomly select 90%/10% nodes into fully-observed/partially-observed sets. • Eron-Email [8]: In email communication networks, each node represents an employee in the company with his/her textual information being the historical written/received emails. We pre- process the original emails and extract the sender/receiver/text information of each email following script here3. 6.1.2 Baselines. For baselines, as no previous works have consid- ered the proximity/role-based relations in RAG, we design baselines by equipping LLMs, GPT3 and GPT3.5 for text generation, with the following RAG strategies: • None: we do not retrieve any additional texts but
