based embeddings and encode their local structural information. We calculate pairwise L2 distance among employees and group them based on their job titles. Similarly, we observe a generally lower role-based topological distance for employees possessing the same roles, indicating their local subgraph structures are aligned with their job titles in reality. The above two observations motivate us to explore the potential of augmenting text generation by leveraging topology information. In the next, we introduce notations used throughout this paper and formulate the task of topology-aware text generation. 2.2 Notations Let S = {𝑆𝑖 }𝑚+𝑛 𝑖=1 be the set of 𝑚 + 𝑛 text sequences where 𝑆𝑖 repre- sents the 𝑖th sequence. Assume we also have access to an additional graph connecting these textual sequences 𝐺 = (V, E) where each node 𝑣𝑖 corresponds to a textual sequence 𝑆𝑖 and the edge 𝑒𝑖 𝑗 de- notes the connection between node 𝑣𝑖 and 𝑣 𝑗 . Furthermore, the adjacency matrix of this graph is notated as A ∈ R(𝑚+𝑛) × (𝑚+𝑛) where A𝑖 𝑗 = 1 if there is an edge 𝑒𝑖 𝑗 connecting 𝑣𝑖 and 𝑣 𝑗 , and A𝑖 𝑗 = 0 otherwise. Let N𝑖 be the neighbors of node 𝑣𝑖. We formu- late the topology-aware text generation in the following. 2.3 Task Formulation Given a set of textual sequences S = SFull ∪ SPartial where SFull = {𝑆𝑖 }𝑛 𝑖=1 comprises sequences with completely accessible texts, and SPartial = {𝑆𝑖 }𝑚 𝑖=1 consists of sequences with texts that are only par- tially observable. As the objective of many text-generation applica- tions is to generate complete texts based on the first few pre-existing words/sentences, the "partially observed texts" in this paper refer to the initial words provided in a sequence. Let the partially observed text be 𝑋𝑖 for 𝑖th sequence
