𝐾 𝜙Topo(𝑣𝑖, 𝑣 𝑗 ), (7) After that, we formulate the texts of nodes in T𝑖 along with the partially observed text 𝑋𝑖 of target node 𝑣𝑖 into the prompt trigger- ing LLM for text generation. Compared with conventional retrievals that only consider textual relations, the Topo-RAG framework con- siders topological relations. To implement this, it’s necessary to pre-calculate the topological relations between every pair of nodes, a process requiring O (|V |2) in both space and time complexity. To manage space constraints, we apply a top-k thresholding, reducing the space requirement significantly to O (|V |𝐾). These computa- tions are done in advance during an offline phase. Consequently, when a text generation request for a specific target node is made, we can retrieve the necessary information instantaneously from the pre-computed dictionary, maintaining a time complexity of O (1). Note that prompting LLMs with the retrieved nodes of very long texts could exceed the input limits. Since this is a common issue for any RAG framework, one can equip our Topo-RAG framework with the existing strategies [30, 63] that handle this long-context issue. Here, we exclude instances where the context limit is ex- ceeded. The length distribution analysis in Figure 7(b) reveals that the textual length of most nodes remains within acceptable limits, ensuring that our results and insights are still applicable to the original dataset even after the exclusion. 6 EXPERIMENTS Table 1: Statistics of Datasets.
