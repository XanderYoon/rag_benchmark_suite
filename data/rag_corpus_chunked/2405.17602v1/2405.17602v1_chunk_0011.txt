Following previous works [8, 51], we measure this topological similarity between two nodes by the similarity of their topological embeddings. In the next, we explore two types of node topological embeddings: proximity-based and role-based ones. 4.1 Proximity-based Topological Similarity Proximity-based topological similarity quantifies the similarity be- tween two nodes via their topological distance in the graph. The general intuition here is that two topologically close nodes usually have a higher textual similarity. Conventional ways of characterizing the topological distance between two nodes in a graph include the shortest path distance and the shallow embeddings (e.g., random walk, personalized page rank and diffusion [15, 17]). In this work, we choose the diffusion- based one due to its thorough consideration of all potential paths in contributing to the proximity between any two nodes. Given a degree-normalized adjacency matrix bA = D−1A and an identity matrix I ∈ { 0, 1}𝑁 ×𝑁 uniquely identifying each node, we perform diffusion to obtain the propagated node embeddings as: P = 𝐾∑︁ 𝑘=1 𝛼𝑘 bA𝑘I, (3) where P𝑖 𝑗 quantifies the influence of node𝑣 𝑗 on node 𝑣𝑖 considering paths of lengths varying from 1 to 𝐾 since two nodes that are topo- logically close to each other should receive similar influence from all Figure 4: Correlation between Proximity-based Topological Similarity and Textual Similarity.
