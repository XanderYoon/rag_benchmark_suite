classification and link prediction on the Cora and Pubmed datasets. This indicates that the texts generated by TopoRAG are more closely aligned with the main topics (node classification) and citations (link prediction) of their corresponding papers.

This is because GNN-based models inherently leverage neighborhood information to enhance context and hence compromise the augmenting effect caused by incorporating additional knowledge by Topo-RAG. De- spite this inherent benefit, equipping them with TopoRAG still boosts the performance as TopoRAG additionally considers the po- tential of incorporating texts of non-neighboring nodes while the message-passing of GCN/SAGE only considers neighboring texts. In addition, we can see the additional benefit of TopoRAG on Cora is more than the one on Pubmed. We hypothesize that this is due to the higher correlation between textual similarity and topological similarity of Cora (0.2099) than the one of
