is computed as the L2-distance between their corresponding structural embeddings, i.e., 𝜙Topo 𝑎,𝑏 = 1 | |P𝑎 −P𝑏 | |2 . To verify the correlation between the role-based topological sim- ilarity and textual similarity, we conduct correlation analysis on the Eron-Email dataset in Figure 5. Following the experimental setting for Figure 2(c)-(d), we group each pair of employees based on their L2 topological distance and compute average textual simi- larity using their sent/received emails in Figure 5(a)/(b). We can see the negative correlation (-0.1937/-0.3295) between the role-based topological distance between two employees and the similarity of their sent/received emails. To sum up, the positive responses to the preceding questions confirm two key insights. Firstly by the answer to 𝑸1, LLMs sig- nificantly benefit from incorporating additional texts during text generation. The closer the resemblance of these additional texts to the generated one, the greater the enhancement is in the output. Sec- ondly, by the answer to 𝑸2, there is a positive correlation between textual and topological similarity. Drawing from these findings, we propose a novel framework using topological similarity to guide the retrieval of additional texts, thereby augmenting the quality of the generated text, i.e., Topology-aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Topo-RAG), which is introduced next. 5 FRAMEWORK OF TOPO-RAG Following Eq. (1), the retriever works by retrieving top-K nodes according to their topological similarity to the target text as follows: T𝑖 = ΩRetriever(𝑋𝑖, SFull, 𝐺) = arg max 𝑣 𝑗 ∈ V 𝐾 𝜙Topo(𝑣𝑖, 𝑣 𝑗 ), (7) After that, we formulate the texts of nodes in T𝑖 along with the partially observed text 𝑋𝑖 of target node 𝑣𝑖 into the prompt trigger- ing LLM for text generation. Compared with conventional retrievals that only consider textual relations, the Topo-RAG framework con- siders topological relations. To implement this, it’s necessary to pre-calculate the
