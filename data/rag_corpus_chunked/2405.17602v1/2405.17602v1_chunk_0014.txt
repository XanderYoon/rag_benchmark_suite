employees obtained from GraphWave while textual similarity is calculated as the average cosine similarity of textual embeddings of either the sent (a) or received emails (b) between two employees. Following this intuition, we employ one of the most representa- tive embedding methods, GraphWave, that encodes the node local structure information in the next. Following GraphWave [8], the spectral graph wavelet Ψ𝑎 is cal- culated as: Ψ𝑎 = UDiag(𝑔𝑠 (𝜆1), . . . , 𝑔𝑠 (𝜆𝑁 ))U⊤1𝑎, (4) where L = D − A = UΛU⊤ and 𝜆1 ≤ 𝜆2 ≤ ... ≤ 𝜆𝑁 (Λ = Diag(𝜆1, 𝜆2, ..., 𝜆𝑁 )) is the eigenvalues of L) with 𝑔𝑠 (𝜆) = 𝑒 −𝜆𝑠 being the kernel filter. 1𝑎 is the one-hot vector for node 𝑣𝑎. Ψ𝑎 denotes the spectral graph wavelet for the heat kernel centered at node 𝑣𝑎 and more specifically, its𝑏th-entry Ψ𝑏𝑎 denotes the amount of energy that node 𝑣𝑎 has received from node 𝑣𝑏. Furthermore, GraphWave treats the spectral graph wavelet of node 𝑣𝑎, i.e., Ψ𝑎, as a probability distribution and characterizes it via the empirical characteristic function with 𝑖 being the imaginary number here: 𝜙Ψ𝑎 (𝑡) = E𝑣𝑏 ∼V (𝑒𝑖𝑡 Ψ𝑎𝑏 ), (5) Eventually, structural embedding P𝑎 of node 𝑣𝑎 is obtained by sampling the 2-dimensional characteristics function at d evenly spaced points 𝑡1, 𝑡2, ..., 𝑡𝑑 and concatenating them as: P𝑎 = || 𝑡1,𝑡2,...,𝑡𝑑 [Re(𝜙Ψ𝑎 (𝑡)), Im(𝜙Ψ𝑎 (𝑡))] . (6) Then the topological similarity between two nodes is computed as the L2-distance between their corresponding structural embeddings, i.e., 𝜙Topo 𝑎,𝑏 = 1 | |P𝑎 −P𝑏 | |2 . To verify the correlation between the role-based topological sim- ilarity and textual similarity, we conduct correlation analysis on the Eron-Email dataset in Figure 5. Following the experimental setting for Figure 2(c)-(d), we group each pair of employees based on
