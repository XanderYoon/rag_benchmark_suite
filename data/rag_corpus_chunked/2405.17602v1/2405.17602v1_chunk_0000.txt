To tackle these issues, Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) is employed as an effective strategy to enhance the available knowledge base and anchor the responses in reality by pulling additional texts from external databases. In real-world applications, texts are often linked through entities within a graph, such as citations in academic papers or comments in social net- works. This paper exploits these topological relationships to guide the retrieval process in RAG. Specifically, we explore two kinds of topological connections: proximity-based, focusing on closely connected nodes, and role-based, which looks at nodes sharing similar subgraph structures. Our empirical research confirms their relevance to text relationships, leading us to develop a Topology- aware Retrieval-augmented Generation framework. This frame- work includes a retrieval module that selects texts based on their topological relationships and an aggregation module that integrates these texts into prompts to stimulate LLMs for text generation. We have curated established text-attributed networks and conducted comprehensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of this framework, demonstrating its potential to enhance RAG with topo- logical awareness.
