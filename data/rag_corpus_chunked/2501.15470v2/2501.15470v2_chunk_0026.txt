selection in determining the overall performance. While larger MLLMs typi- cally demonstrate superior results, our Qwen2-7B-VL-Cog closely approximates the performance of Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct across most evaluation metrics. This finding serves to validate the efficacy of our fine-tuning strategy. Under the CogPlanner framework, our results demonstrate that it is indeed possible to deploy a resource- efficient planning expert, leading to enhanced performance of the MRAG system. Specifically, the Qwen2-7B-VL-Cog emerges as a compelling alternative. 6.3.2 Efficiency Evaluation.We compare the efficiency of CogPlan- ner with Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct and Qwen2-7B-VL-Cog as the planning expert. Specifically, we use total token generation and latency as the primary evaluation metrics, excluding the cost associ- ated with final answer generation to isolate planning efficiency. As shown in Table 4, our findings indicate that Qwen2-7B-VL-Cog con- stitutes a significantly more lightweight module for MRAG systems, incurring only a 10% increase in token consumption, but reducing latency to just 30% compared to the Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct model. It emerges as a practical compromise between performance and computational efficiency, particularly well-suited for deployment in real-world industrial settings. Furthermore, the parallel execu- tion model exhibits superior performance relative to the sequential modeling approach across both efficiency metrics, aligning with our design expectations.
