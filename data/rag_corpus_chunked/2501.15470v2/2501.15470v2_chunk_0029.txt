necessarily harm overall performance. (3) Notably, most tasks appear to be resolved around 2-hop retrieval steps, even for more complex queries requiring greater than 2 hops. Determining an optimal retrieval strategy that aligns with the model’s knowledge base and reasoning capabilities remains a challenging task for current MLLMs. 7 Conclusion This work introduces Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation Planning (MRAG Planning) to address the limitations of current MRAG frameworks. Our research underscores the importance of dynamically optimizing the information acquisition and query refor- mulation processes. The CogPlanner framework leverages decision- making to refine queries and select appropriate retrieval strategies, minimizing redundant retrieval and enhancing response quality. CogPlanner offers flexible modeling approaches and integrates seamlessly with existing MRAG systems. Additionally, we propose the CogBench benchmark to assess MRAG Planning’s decision- making capabilities, filling a gap in current evaluation methods. The experimental results validate the efficacy of MRAG Planning and CogPlanner, showcasing substantial improvements in perfor- mance with minimal additional computational costs. This work paves the way for more adaptive and effective MRAG frameworks. References [1] Gaurav Arora, Shreya Jain, and Srujana Merugu. 2024.
