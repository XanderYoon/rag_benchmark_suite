the order in which the decision-making occurs. Parallel ModelingIn the parallel modeling paradigm, the plan- ning expert concurrently adjusts the query and determines the appropriate retrieval action. Specifically, it takes the current query alongside the information retrieved in the preceding iteration as inputs. The implementation employs two parallel threads of MLLM inference: one is responsible for query reformulation, while the other determines the next retrieval action. The primary advan- tage of this paradigm lies in efficiency. By enabling simultaneous decision-making, we achieve a streamlined decision chain and faster processing. This is particularly beneficial in real-world applications where response latency is a critical consideration. The parallel process can be formally expressed as: Q𝑡 =F𝑄𝑅 (Q𝑡−1 ,D 𝑡 ), A𝑡 =F𝐼𝐴 (Q𝑡−1 ,D 𝑡 ).

The first step involves query reformulation, wherein multimodal inputs, along with previ- ously retrieved information, are leveraged to refine and decompose the query. These restructured queries then serve as the inputs for the subsequent stage, which entails an evaluation of the necessity of further retrieval actions. This paradigm facilitates a more nu- anced understanding of information retrieval requirements, as the planning expert is presented with both the original query and its reformulated meta-queries. It mimics a reflective cognitive process where the planning expert jointly assesses whether the queries align with the system’s knowledge bounds. Such an assessment enables the expert to more accurately determine whether additional retrieval actions are needed. This capability is especially beneficial for complex queries that demand deeper reasoning regarding infor- mation sufficiency. The sequential modeling process is formalized as follows: Q𝑡 =F𝑄𝑅 (Q𝑡−1 ,D 𝑡 ), A𝑡 =F𝐼𝐴 (Q𝑡 ,D
