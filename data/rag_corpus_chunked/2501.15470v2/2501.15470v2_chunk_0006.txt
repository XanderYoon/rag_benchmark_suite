Early IR systems rely on complex, multi-stage query processing pipelines, which incorporate a range of techniques, including query rewriting [20], intention detection [1], sentiment analysis [34], and query expansion [27], among others. These pipelines often utilize human-defined heuristics to refine the query, enabling more precise document retrieval [14, 16]. However, the advent of large language models (LLMs) has significantly transformed this approach. The exceptional expressive power and reasoning capabilities of LLMs allow them to effectively perform several traditional query pro- cessing tasks within a single, well-crafted prompt. This shift has been particularly notable in the context of RAG systems, where the primary challenge now lies in determining the most effective strategy for processing user queries. 2.2 Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation RAG frameworks have demonstrated considerable success in var- ious real-world applications [16]. However, their reliance on tex- tual information presents a significant limitation, as it precludes the incorporation of crucial knowledge embedded within other modalities, such as images and videos. Multimodal Retrieval Aug- mented Generation (MRAG) seeks to address this limitation by equipping MLLMs with access to a broader spectrum of knowl- edge, encompassing up-to-date and domain-specific information [36]. Empirical studies consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of MRAG systems [35] across various visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks [30]. Recent advancements in MRAG have demon- strated notable progress. For instance, MuRAG [5] highlights how CogPlanner: Unveiling the Potential of Agentic Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation with Planning SIGIR-AP 2025, December 7-10, 2025, Xi’an, China incorporating visual information retrieved from external sources significantly improves the system performance.
