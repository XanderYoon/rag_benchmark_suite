answer. Finally, the CogBench dataset is divided into training and test sets, comprising 5307 and 401 samples, respectively. 5.3 CogBench Analysis As shown in Table 1 and Figure 3, CogBench contains 5718 user queries spanning 9 distinct cognitive domains. We identify several fundamental characteristics that distinguish CogBench from exist- ing benchmarks. (1) Unlike previous benchmarks, which focus pri- marily on query-response pairs, CogBench offers a comprehensive record of the entire planning procedure involved in MRAG tasks, thereby facilitating the training of MLLMs. (2) A critical limitation of current MRAG benchmarks lies in their reliance on artificial query construction, primarily through simple entity substitution techniques [8, 19]. Such methodologies typically yield responses confined to single entities or numerical values, severely understat- ing the complexity inherent in real-world multimodal interaction scenarios. In contrast, CogBench introduces 24.19% open-ended queries that demand sophisticated, multi-faceted responses encom- passing multiple interconnected claims with much longer answer length - 40.13 tokens on average. (3) CogBench incorporates diverse planning procedures that necessitate distinct search strategies at different stages, resulting in varied decision chains across different MLLMs. To quantify this complexity, we also ask the annotators to assess the number of reasoning steps required for resolution (e.g. a single round of question answering is considered a 1-hop query). Our findings reveal that 79.55% of cases explicitly require MRAG Planning, highlighting the sophisticated nature of the reasoning tasks presented in our benchmark. 5.4 Lightweight Integration of CogPlanner To improve the efficiency and reduce the resource requirements of the CogPlanner framework, we aim to achieve a more light- weight integration within MRAG systems. Building upon the Cog- Bench, we introduce a specialized fine-tuning strategy tailored for smaller, resource-efficient MLLMs to broaden the applicability of the CogPlanner framework and mitigate resource constraints.
