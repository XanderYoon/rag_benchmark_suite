frame- work, we present CogBench, a comprehensive dataset tailored to the MRAG Planning task. CogBench consists of over 5,000 data samples, with a high-quality test set of 401 samples. In addition to its essential role in evaluation, the development of CogBench facilitates the design of specialized fine-tuning strategies aimed at bolstering the decision-making capabilities of smaller, resource- efficient MLLMs. By utilizing the CogBench training set, we achieve 1We name our framework as CogPlanner because of the inherent cognitive process of humans. lightweight integration of the Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct [28] model as the planning expert in CogPlanner. This integration, referred to as Qwen2-7B-VL-Cog, maintains its resource-efficient characteristics while enabling effective performance within the MRAG Planning context. In summary, the contributions of this work are as follows: • We thoroughly examine the limitations of current MRAG frame- works, specifically addressing the challenges of information ac- quisition and query reformulation. Building upon this, we for- mally define the task of Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Gen- eration Planning (MRAG Planning), laying the groundwork for further research. • We introduce CogPlanner, a flexible, plug-and-play framework that incorporates two distinct modeling approaches, parallel mod- eling and sequential modeling. • We develop the CogBench benchmark, tailored to the MRAG Planning task. It supports performance evaluation and facilitates fine-tuning strategies to enable the lightweight integration of resource-efficient MLLMs with CogPlanner. Experimental results demonstrate that CogPlanner achieves more than 15% improve- ments over various MRAG approaches while incurring less than 10% additional costs with Qwen2-VL-7B. 2 Related Work 2.1 Query Processing in IR Query processing is a critical aspect of Information Retrieval (IR) systems, directly influencing the efficiency and effectiveness with which relevant information is retrieved in response to user queries. Early IR systems rely on complex, multi-stage query processing pipelines, which incorporate a range of techniques, including query rewriting [20], intention
