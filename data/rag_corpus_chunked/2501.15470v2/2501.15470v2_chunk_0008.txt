of MRAG Planning is to systematically determine the most effective query processing strategy tailored to each multimodal query and the underlying MLLMs. 3 Task Formulation Consider a multimodal query Q0 =(𝑞, 𝑣) where 𝑞 represents the textual component and 𝑣 represents the visual component (e.g., an image). The objective of MRAG is to retrieve pertinent informa- tion from a document collection D={D 1, . . . ,D 𝑛 }, and gener- ate cogent responses. Drawing parallels with human information processing, we introduce the task of MRAG Planning that inter- faces intimately with the retrieval tools and downstream MLLMs in the MRAG systems, restructuring their information gathering mechanism. We formalize the MRAG system environment as a tuple (G,I) . Here, G refers to the goal conditions of assembling sufficient information to generate comprehensive and accurate responses. S represents the state, capturing the current set of infor- mation available, which may encompass queries and any retrieved documents. The initial state corresponds to the input multimodal query, I=S 0 =Q 0. The MRAG Planning task can thus be framed as a state transition function F that progresses from I toward the goal state through a chain of decisions. Formally, this transition process is defined as follows: F:S × P → S,(1) wherePrepresents the available decision space. 3.1 Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation Planning In line with the human cognitive architecture’s capacity for knowl- edge integration, we conceptualize the MRAG Planning task as a dual optimization problem comprising two sub-tasks: information acquisition and query reformulation. 3.1.1 Planning Procedure.The decision space can thus be decom- posed as P=(A,Q) , where A represents the information acqui- sition strategy and Q denotes the query reformulation result. To accommodate multi-hop reasoning queries, the planning process unfolds iteratively across 𝑇 rounds under the assumption of Mar- kovian state transitions. Specifically,
