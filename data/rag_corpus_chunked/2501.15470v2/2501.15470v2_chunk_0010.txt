For complex queries necessitating multi-hop reasoning, we employ a decomposition strategy that preserves semantic relationships while breaking down the query into manageable sub-queries. This process can be expressed as: Q𝑡 =F 𝑄𝑅 (Q𝑡−1 ,S 𝑡 )={Q 𝑡,1, . . . ,Q 𝑡,𝑁 𝑡 },(5) where 𝑁𝑡 represents the cardinality of the decomposed and refined query set at iteration𝑡. 3.1.4 Generation.Once the final state S𝑇 is deemed sufficiently informed, the planning process culminates in response generation. The response is synthesized by incorporating the initial query, the final refined query, and the relevant document elements: Response=F 𝐺𝑒𝑛 (Q 0,Q 𝑇 ,D 𝑇 ),(6) whereF 𝐺𝑒𝑛 represents the MLLM generator. 4 Methodology 4.1 Baselines Existing MRAG methodologies predominantly rely on a fixed in- formation acquisition pipeline, characterized by a single-modality retrieval action performed in a single turn. These methods can be broadly classified into two distinct categories: • Fixed textual retrieval, which closely resembles traditional RAG frameworks. They employ textual queries to retrieve relevant documents to generate the final answer. SIGIR-AP 2025, December 7-10, 2025, Xi’an, China Trovato et al.
