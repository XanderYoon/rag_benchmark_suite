optimization problem comprising two sub-tasks: information acquisition and query reformulation. 3.1.1 Planning Procedure.The decision space can thus be decom- posed as P=(A,Q) , where A represents the information acqui- sition strategy and Q denotes the query reformulation result. To accommodate multi-hop reasoning queries, the planning process unfolds iteratively across 𝑇 rounds under the assumption of Mar- kovian state transitions. Specifically, at each iteration𝑡, the decision is determined by the current available information state: S𝑡 → (A 𝑡 ,Q 𝑡 ).(2) The subsequent state is updated naturally as follows: {S𝑡 ,(A 𝑡,Q 𝑡 )} → S 𝑡+1,(3) where S𝑡 may encompass the historical queries or the retrieved document elements, denoted asD 𝑡 . 3.1.2 Information Aquisition.Recognizing the inherent limitations of MLLMs in terms of specific knowledge gaps, an information acquisition mechanism is imperative to supplement the MLLM’s knowledge base. We defineA as comprising three distinct retrieval operations: text search, image search, and non-search. The optimal retrieval action is determined based on the quality of the available multimodal information and the estimated utility of additional context from external knowledge sources: A𝑡 =arg max 𝑎∈ A F𝐼𝐴 (𝑎|S𝑡 ).(4) Post action selection, we proceed with in-document retrieval, which identifies and extracts pertinent elements under the selected re- trieval strategy, yielding retrieved document elementsD 𝑡 . 3.1.3 Query Reformalization.To address the ambiguity and poten- tial incompleteness in queries, we refine the queries by leverag- ing both textual and visual cues within the multimodal query. For complex queries necessitating multi-hop reasoning, we employ a decomposition strategy that preserves semantic relationships while breaking down the query into manageable sub-queries. This process can be expressed as: Q𝑡 =F 𝑄𝑅 (Q𝑡−1 ,S 𝑡 )={Q 𝑡,1, . . . ,Q 𝑡,𝑁 𝑡 },(5) where 𝑁𝑡 represents the cardinality of the decomposed and refined query set at iteration𝑡. 3.1.4 Generation.Once
