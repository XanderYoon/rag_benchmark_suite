of IKS for a batch size of 1 is 35.2𝑊 . With larger batch sizes, data reuse ensures that the power required for LPDDR access remains constant, but the power consumption of the processing engines increases linearly as more engines are activated to handle the additional workload. For instance, at full utilization with a batch size of 64, the total power consumption increases to 65𝑊 . 7.4 Cost and Power Comparison with GPU IKS utilizes LPDDR5X memory to store embedding vectors. While figures for the cost of LPDDR5X are not yet available, we assume that HBM is more than3× more expensive than LPDDR [54]. Since a single IKS unit includes6.4× as much onboard memory as a single NVIDIA H100 GPU, the memory cost of IKS is expected to be approximately2.5× greater than that of a GPU. For the comparison of compute unit cost, the GPU has a die area of 826𝑚𝑚2, while the IKS NMAs total a die area of 220 𝑚𝑚2. Because the production cost of a chip increases superlin- early with die area [55], an IKS unit (with5× larger memory capacity) is expected to cost a fraction of a GPU. 8 Discussion IKS provides a cost-effective solution for accelerating ENNS, where the quality of the search is not dataset-dependent. How- ever, if the dataset is amenable to clustering, then the accuracy gap between ENNS and ANNS would reduce, making ANNS more attractive for retrieval. Moreover, IKS is best-suited to RAG applications requiring very high recall, and for datasets difficult to search with existing ANNS schemes with relatively large batch sizes. For example, modern ANNS schemes cannot eliminate more than 99% of the search space for the GloVe dataset [94], so at least 64% of the corpus must be read by an ANNS that does not offer data re-use
