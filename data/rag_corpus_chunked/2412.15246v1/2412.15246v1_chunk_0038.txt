The end-to-end inference time speedup provided by IKS ranges between 5.6 and 25.6× for FiDT5, between 5.0 and 24.6× for Llama-8B, and between 1.7 and 16.8× for Llama-70B for various batch sizes, corpus sizes, and document counts. To gain a comprehensive understanding of how the perfor- mance and accuracy of RAG applications with IKS accelera- tion compare across various configurations, Figure 11 depicts the queries per second and accuracy ofFiDT5, Llama-8B, and Llama-70B implemented using four different configurations: RAG with ENNS running on CPU, RAG with ANNS (two Corpus Size 50 GB 512 GB Batch Size 1 64 1 64 Write Query Vector 0.3 us 1 us 0.3 us 1 us Dot-Product 45.96 ms 45.96 ms 470.6ms 470.6 ms Partial Top-32 Read 0.7 us 22.4 us 0.7 us 22.4 us Top-K Aggregation 19 us 540 us 23 us 390 us Total 46.0 ms 46.5 ms 470.6 ms 471.0 ms Table 3.

The generative model runs on the GPU in all these configurations. As illustrated in Figure 11, although ANNS-2 configurations exhibit higher throughput compared to ENNS (running on the CPU), their accuracy is lower. For RAG applications that use IKS, retrieval is not a bottleneck, and throughput is significantly improved, even compared to ANNS, as the same generation accuracy can be achieved with smaller values of K (i.e., smaller but more accurate context sent to the generative model). 7.3 Power and
