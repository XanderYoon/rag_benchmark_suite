have not been fine-tuned for this task. Several prior works [6;110] demonstrate that hyper-parameter tuning can enhance the retrieval accuracy of ANNS, poten- tially matching that of ENNS across various workloads. While we optimized our HNSW indexes for accuracy and through- put, these indexes could not match ENNS in end-to-end gen- eration accuracy while achieving significantly (more than 2×) faster search. By using a smallefSearch value, retrieval speed improves significantly, allowing for the use of a larger value of K to compensate for the reduced retrieval quality. However, trading retrieval quality for retrieval speed in this way resulted in lower generation accuracy and end-to-end throughput compared to a larger efSearch, where a higher- quality, slower search scheme permits greater accuracy at lower K values (thus reducing generation times). For example, ANNS-2 with 16 documents have 3% higher accuracy and 128% higher throughput compared to ANNS-1 with 128 documents for FiDT5. Further improving retrieval quality via exact search gives ENNS-based RAG Pareto-superiority above sufficiently high accuracy thresholds (∼ 43%, ∼ 27%, and ∼ 14% for FiDT5, Llama-8B, and Llama-70B, respectively) as demonstrated in Figure 2. In general, our findings highlight the potential for reducing generation time by leveraging high-quality retrieval methods when high accuracy is required. Scaling of ANNS and ENNS: Previous works [6; 52] iden- tified the trade-off between retrieval quality and runtime, and challenges with high-quality ANNS have motivated ac- celerators such as ANNA [ 40] and NDSearch [ 95]. While lower-quality ANNS algorithms could possibly provide or- ders of magnitude faster nearest neighbor search compared with ENNS, high-quality ANNS algorithms are shown to pro- vide only a modest speedup [45; 94]. For example, ANNS-2, which is the best performing ANNS configuration in Figure 2, offers only a 2.5× speedup compared with ENNS. In fact, all the Pareto frontier
