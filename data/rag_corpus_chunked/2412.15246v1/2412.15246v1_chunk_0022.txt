ranges are labeled as Context Buffers (CB). (b) IKS is a compute-enabled CXL memory expander that includes eight LPDDR5X packages with one near-memory accelerator (NMA) chip near each package. (c) Each NMA includes 64 processing engines. (d) Dot-product units reuse the query vector (QV) dimension across 68 MAC units. memory channels, we need a chip with an approximate perime- ter of 160𝑚𝑚. This is because each LPDDR5X channel PHY approximately occupies a shoreline of 2.5𝑚𝑚, based on the die shots of Apple M2 [59] in 5nm technology. A square-shaped chip with a 160𝑚𝑚 perimeter has an area of 1600𝑚𝑚2, which is larger than the state-of-the-art lithography reticle limit [98]. Although we can technically manufacture such a large accel- erator using chiplets, the area of this huge multi-chip module would be wasted, as it is much larger than what is needed to im- plement the NMA logic, memory controllers, and PCIe/CXL controllers. For context, the area of an H100 GPU is 814𝑚𝑚2. Splitting the NMAs into smaller chips increases the aggre- gate chip shoreline and improves yield. Using one NMA per LPDDR5X package requires only eight LPDDR5X memory channels per NMA, necessitating a minimum chip perimeter of 20 𝑚𝑚. IKS implements ×2 PCIe 5.0 to provide a 8 GBps uplink connecting each NMA to the CXL controller. With this design, the uplinks to the CXL controller are oversubscribed. Nevertheless, this oversubscription is neither a bottleneck for IKS operating in acceleration mode nor for IKS operating in memory expander mode. In acceleration mode, the bandwidth of local LPDDR5X channels is utilized for dot product calcula- tions, and in memory expander mode, the data is interleaved over multiple LPDDR5X packages and read in parallel over the multiple ×2 PCIe uplinks. IKS is a type 2 CXL device.IKS’s internal memory is exposed as host-managed
