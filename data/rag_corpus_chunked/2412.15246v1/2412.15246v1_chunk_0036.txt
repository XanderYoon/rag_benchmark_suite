many streaming multipro- cessors and tensor cores to issue memory accesses to DRAM in parallel. To demonstrate the scalability of IKS, we include the re- trieval time of multi-GPU and multi-IKS setups. Because each H100 GPU can fit 80 GB of embedding vectors, 8 GPUs can ac- commodate maximum corpus size of 640 GB. However, with only four IKS devices, we can fit up to a 2 TB corpus size. As shown in Figure 9, with additional GPUs and IKS units, the retrieval time for the same corpus size decreases, demonstrat- ing the high data-level parallelism of ENNS and the strong scaling of both GPU and IKS. For example, GPU retrieval time for a 50 GB corpus size reduces by 1.9×, 3.6×, and 6.9× with 2, 4, and 8 GPU devices, respectively, and IKS retrieval time for a 50 GB corpus size reduces by 1× and 3.9× with 1 and 4 IKS units, respectively. Due to the low-overhead IKS-CPU inter- face, the dominance of similarity search latency in end-to-end ENNS retrieval, and the highly parallelizable nature of ENNS, IKS also provides near-perfect weak scaling. For instance, the retrieval time for a 2 TB corpus on 4 IKS units is only 100𝜇s longer than for a 512 GB corpus on 1 IKS unit. However, we do not evaluate configurations with more than four IKS units, and the overhead of host-side final top-K aggregation scales as additional units are added. Additionally, we do not evaluate deployments of IKS spanning multiple nodes. Table 3 reports the absolute time breakdown of ENNS re- trieval on IKS. We break down the retrieval time of IKS into four components: transfer time of query vectors over the CXL interconnect to the NMAs, time for performing dot-products (both computation and DRAM accesses), updating the top-k score lists in
