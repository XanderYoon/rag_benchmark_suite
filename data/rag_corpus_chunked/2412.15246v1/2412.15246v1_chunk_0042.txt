that each NMA chip requires eight LPDDR5X memory channels, which demand 20 mm of chip shoreline. Therefore, the minimum NMA chip area is 25 mm2 (§5.1). Thus, the area on NMA is effectively free up to a cap of 25 mm2. We chose to utilize this “free” area to over- provision compute so that IKS remains memory-bandwidth Accelerating Retrieval-Augmented Generation bound for all batch sizes below 64. There are opportunities for circuit-level techniques, such as clock and power gating, to power off extra processing engines when the batch size is below 64. Moreover, dynamic voltage and frequency scaling can be used to reduce the frequency and voltage of the NMA chip for batch sizes less than 64, allowing multiple processing engines to perform similarity searches for each query vector. 9 Related Work Sim et al. [84] implement a computational CXL memory so- lution for near-memory processing and showcased ENNS acceleration inside the CXL memory. However, this work implements CXL memory using DDR DRAM, which does not meet the power and bandwidth requirements for ENNS on large corpus sizes used in RAG. Additionally, our work implements a novel interface between host and near-memory accelerators through CXL.cache. Lee et al. [40]and Wang et al. [95] present near-data accelerators for PQ- and Graph-based ANNS, respectively. However, we accelerate ENNS because different corpora are amenable to different ANNS algorithms, and the complex algorithms and memory access patterns of such ANNS schemes also make ANNS accelerators highly task-specific. Ke et al. [33] propose near-memory accelera- tion of DLRM on Samsung AxDIMM. AxDIMM is based on a DIMM form factor that limits per-rank memory capacity and compromises the memory capacity of the host CPU when used as an accelerator (§4). In contrast, IKS does not strand the internal DRAM space and does not have capacity or
