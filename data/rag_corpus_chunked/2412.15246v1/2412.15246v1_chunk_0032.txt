timing [43; 81], along with calculations of real software stack overhead (top-K aggregation and umwait() overhead). It emulates an IKS as a CXL device running on a remote CPU socket. We imple- mented the end-to-end RAG application described in Section 3 (i.e., FiDT5, Llama-8B, and Llama-70B), including the APIs for distributing queries to the NMA query scratchpad and reducing partial top-32 lists on the CPU. We ran the experi- ments on two servers equipped with Intel Xeon 4𝑡ℎ generation CPUs and one NVIDIA H100 GPU NVIDIA GPUs. The system configuration is shown in Table 2. We implemented the RTL design of the Near-Memory Ac- celerator (NMA) used in IKS and synthesized it using Syn- opsys Design Compiler targeting TSMC’s 16nm technology node. This process involved collecting key metrics such as area, power, and timing to ensure the design meets the opti- mal criteria for operation at 1 GHz. For other components, we estimated the area of the memory controllers and PHYs based on die shots from the Apple M2 chip, which utilizes LPDDR5 in a 5nm process [50]. Since the area scaling of mixed-signal components is negligible [23; 88], we assumed the same area for the LPDDR5X PHYs and memory controllers when scaling to 16nm technology. We developed a power model by evaluating the energy consumption of processing operations at the RTL level and in- corporating the energy required for data access to scratchpads and LPDDR memory. For example, accessing data in SRAM consumes 39 fJ per bit, while LPDDR memory access requires 4 pJ per bit [13]. Since these energy values depend on the underlying technology node, we scaled them to correspond to a 16nm technology node for consistency [79]. 6.2 Software configuration Google’s Natural Questions (NQ) dataset [38; 39] is used for the evaluation of models.
