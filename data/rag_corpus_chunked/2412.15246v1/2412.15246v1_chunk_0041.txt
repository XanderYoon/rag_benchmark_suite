to RAG applications requiring very high recall, and for datasets difficult to search with existing ANNS schemes with relatively large batch sizes. For example, modern ANNS schemes cannot eliminate more than 99% of the search space for the GloVe dataset [94], so at least 64% of the corpus must be read by an ANNS that does not offer data re-use across queries; in which case the overheads of common ANNS schemes reduces perfor- mance to below that of ENNS. However, for datasets that are easier to filter, there is an opportunity for improvement by in- corporating approximation techniques into IKS; however, this introduces significant challenges as IKS owes much of its per- formance to the sequential memory access pattern of ENNS. One key inefficiency of IKS is that it performs an exhaus- tive search over the entire corpus, which consumes energy and saturates memory bandwidth. The high internal memory bandwidth utilization of ENNS can cause slowdowns for ex- ternal accesses by other applications that use IKS as a memory expander, rather than a vector database accelerator. Exploring early termination of similarity search [9; 42] could be a nat- ural solution for reducing the memory bandwidth utilization of ENNS without compromising search accuracy. Another inefficiency in the current version of IKS is the low NMA chip utilization for batch sizes less than 64. The rationale for overprovisioning NMA compute is that we effectively have free area on the NMA chip. Note that each NMA chip requires eight LPDDR5X memory channels, which demand 20 mm of chip shoreline. Therefore, the minimum NMA chip area is 25 mm2 (§5.1). Thus, the area on NMA is effectively free up to a cap of 25 mm2. We chose to utilize this “free” area to over- provision compute so that IKS remains memory-bandwidth Accelerating Retrieval-Augmented Generation
