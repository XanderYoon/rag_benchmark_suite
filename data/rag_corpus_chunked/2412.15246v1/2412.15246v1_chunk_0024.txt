of system-on-chip de- signs, resulting in shorter interconnections, faster clocking, and less power wastage during data transmission. The most recent release of LPDDR, LPDDR5X, offers a bandwidth of 8533 Mbps per pin, exceeding that of DDR5, which provides a bandwidth of 7200 MTps. However, one challenge with using LPDDR in a datacenter setting is reliability, as LPDDR was originally designed for mobile systems. Although we could Derrick Quinn et al. provision an in-line ECC processing block for error detec- tion and correction, ENNS similarity search is resilient to bit flips, and rare bit flips in ENNS have negligible impact on the end-to-end RAG accuracy. 5.2 Offload Model The IKS address space is shared with the host CPU. The host CPU stores embedding vectors with a specific data layout (that we discuss in Section 5.5) in contiguous physical addresses in IKS, while the actual documents are stored in the host mem- ory (either in DDR memory or CXL memory). The CPU runs the vector database application, which offloads the similarity calculations (i.e., dot-products between the query vectors and embedding vectors) using iks_search(query), a blocking API that does not require a system call or context switch. After each update operation, the vector database application will flush CPU caches to ensure that wheniks_search(query) is called, IKS does not contain any stale values. iks_search(query) hides the complexity of interacting with IKS hardware from the programmer by writing anoffload context to IKS and initiates an offload by writing into a doorbell register. The offload context and doorbells are communicated through memory-mapped regions calledcontext buffersto the IKS as shown in Figure 5a. Anoffload context includes query vectors, vector dimensions, and the base address of the first embedding vector stored in each LPDDR5X package. The host process then uses umwait() to block on the doorbell regis- ter
