accuracy while maintaining a reasonable graph, yielding an index withM of 32 andefCon- struction of 128. From this, we evaluate two configurations, ANNS-1 and ANNS-2, which use different efSearch param- eters: 2048 and 10000. In the context of an end-to-end RAG system, the trade-off of generation accuracy and runtime was evaluated for this index for various choices of efSearch. A lower efSearch provides higher search throughput, but lower generation accuracy, and a higher efSearch provides lower search throughput, but higher generation accuracy. Other HNSW and IVFPQ indexes were tested but provided lower generation accuracy, or similar runtime to ENNS (or even worse, in some cases), negating the benefits of approximation. Generation Accuracy with ANNS vs. ENNS: Figure 2 compares the generation accuracy and throughput of ANNS- and ENNS-based RAG applications forFiDT5, Llama-8B, and Llama-70B. The figure illustrates that retrieval quality strongly influences the end-to-end generation accuracy. As shown in Figure 2, with document count of one, compared to ENNS, the generation accuracy of ANNS-1 and ANNS-2 drops by 22.6 and 34.0% for FiDT5, 52.8 and 53.4% forLlama-8B, and 51.0 and 51.5% forLlama-70B, respectively. With a document count of 16, a similar trend in generation accuracy is observed, with ANNS-1 and ANNS-2 leading to an accuracy reduction of 13.6 and 22% forFiDT5, 38.4 and 42.2% forLlama-8B, and 38.4 and 45.2% forLlama-70B, respectively. Interestingly, the impact of retrieval quality on generation accuracy appears to be even larger when using large models that have not been fine-tuned for this task. Several prior works [6;110] demonstrate that hyper-parameter tuning can enhance the retrieval accuracy of ANNS, poten- tially matching that of ENNS across various workloads. While we optimized our HNSW indexes for accuracy and through- put, these indexes could not match ENNS in end-to-end gen- eration accuracy while achieving significantly (more than 2×) faster
