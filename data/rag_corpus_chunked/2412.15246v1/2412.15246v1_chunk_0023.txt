nor for IKS operating in memory expander mode. In acceleration mode, the bandwidth of local LPDDR5X channels is utilized for dot product calcula- tions, and in memory expander mode, the data is interleaved over multiple LPDDR5X packages and read in parallel over the multiple ×2 PCIe uplinks. IKS is a type 2 CXL device.IKS’s internal memory is exposed as host-managed device memory where both the CPU and IKS can cache addresses within this unified address space (Fig- ure 5a). IKS leverages the low-latency accesses of CXL.mem and CXL.cache protocols to implement a novel interface be- tween the near-memory accelerators and the CPU that: (1) eliminates the need for DMA setup and buffer management, and (2) eliminates the overhead of interrupt and polling for im- plementing notifications between the CPU and near-memory accelerators (§5.3). IKS supports spatial and coarse-grain temporal multi- tenancy. In spatial multi-tenancy, the IKS driver partitions embedding vectors that belong to different vector databases across different packages, allowing each NMA to execute ENNS independently per vector database. For temporal multi- tenancy, the IKS driver time-multiplexes similarity search in NMAs among different vector databases that store their embedding vectors in the same LPDDRX5 package. Time mul- tiplexing takes place at the boundary of a complete similarity search. Why LPDDR? For IKS, a customized type-2 CXL device that should support cost-effective high capacity, neither HBM (ex- pensive) nor DDR (general-purpose) are good options. LPDDR DRAM packages are integrated as part of system-on-chip de- signs, resulting in shorter interconnections, faster clocking, and less power wastage during data transmission. The most recent release of LPDDR, LPDDR5X, offers a bandwidth of 8533 Mbps per pin, exceeding that of DDR5, which provides a bandwidth of 7200 MTps. However, one challenge with using LPDDR in a datacenter setting is reliability, as LPDDR was originally designed
