higher throughput compared to ENNS (running on the CPU), their accuracy is lower. For RAG applications that use IKS, retrieval is not a bottleneck, and throughput is significantly improved, even compared to ANNS, as the same generation accuracy can be achieved with smaller values of K (i.e., smaller but more accurate context sent to the generative model). 7.3 Power and Area Analysis The area of each NMA, which contains 64 processing en- gines, each comprising a dot-product unit, a 2 KB SRAM query scratchpad, a top-K unit, and an output scratchpad, is approximately 3.4 mm2 in the 16nm TSMC technology node. Additionally, 14 mm2 is required for the PHYs and memory controllers. However, the area of the NMA chip is determined by the shoreline because the 21 mm of shoreline required per NMA (20 mm for the LPDDR5X PHYs and 1 mm for PCIe PHYs §5.1) necessitates that the NMA occupy at least 27.56 mm2 in the 16nm technology node. The NMA can be manufactured using older technology nodes to reduce costs and prevent area wastage, as the PHY area (which is mixed-signal) does not scale at the same rate as SRAM and logic [23; 88]. For a batch size of 1 and vector dimensions of 1024, the pro- cessing engines, along with the corresponding query scratch- pad accesses, consume approximately 59𝑚𝑊 , while accessing embedding vectors from LPDDR memory requires 4.35𝑊 . As a result, the total power consumption of IKS for a batch size of 1 is 35.2𝑊 . With larger batch sizes, data reuse ensures that the power required for LPDDR access remains constant, but the power consumption of the processing engines increases linearly as more engines are activated to handle the additional workload. For instance, at full utilization with a batch size of 64, the total
