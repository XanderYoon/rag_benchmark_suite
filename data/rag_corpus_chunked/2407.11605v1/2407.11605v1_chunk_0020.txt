filtering information, recommendation, conversation follow-up, contributing to multi-party conversations, or requesting feedback. Developing an Initiator Model. The subsequent step involves selecting a proactive instance from the instance collection using an initiator component. The primary challenge in this component stems from our limited understanding of the optimal moment to initiate a conversation. Consequently, future research should emphasize conducting user studies to explore the ideal timing for con- versation initiation. Weak signals gleaned from user interactions with existing conversational systems, even those lacking proactive capabilities, could provide valuable insights. For instance, instances, where users initiate trivial conversa- tions (e.g., out of boredom), could serve as noisy but potentially useful signals for predicting optimal conversation initiation moments. Machine learning mod- els trained on situational context and user profiles could leverage such signals. Furthermore, interactive systems that log user interactions offer the opportunity to iteratively refine prediction accuracy based on user feedback. Generating System-Initiative Utterances. The final step entails gener- ating a (natural language) interaction based on a proactive instance and present- ing it to the user. Techniques from dialogue systems and text generation research can be leveraged for this purpose. Since users typically do not anticipate proac- tive utterances, a notable technical challenge lies in providing context within the generated utterance to ensure user comprehension. This context could reference previous interactions with the system, user experiences, or explanations regard- ing the rationale behind initiating the conversation. Given that each instance is a structured data object, neural models designed for unstructured text generation from structured data, such as tables, could be potentially useful. 6.4 Evaluation of Proactive Systems Assessing proactive generative IR systems poses significant challenges. While IR research has traditionally focused on creating collections for specific information- seeking tasks, these collections are typically based on predefined needs (e.g., TREC5 tracks) or observations (e.g.,
