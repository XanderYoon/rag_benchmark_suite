mere recommendations. For example, Avula and Arguello [9] devised a system for conducting wizard- of-oz experiments, investigating proactive interactions during conversational col- laborative search. This system could seamlessly integrate into collaborative plat- forms like Slack, 4 where during a collaborative search task, an external u ser (acting as a wizard) provides information. Though advancements in this area are nascent, there exists considerable potential for systems to initiate context- based conversations, engaging users and eliciting feedback. Consider a scenario where a user employs a mapping application to navigate to a restaurant. Leveraging contextual cues, a proactive generative retrieval sys- tem could subsequently initiate a conversation upon the user’s return journey, inquiring about their dining experience. Such interactions not only enhance user engagement but also facilitate feedback collection, aiding in profile refinement. Similarly, in situations where a user encounters difficulty in task completion, a conversational system could autonomously engage in conversation, offering as- sistance [85]. 6.2 User Responses to Proactive Interactions While in generative retrieval systems, users have the freedom to provide a natural language response in any form, they can be categorized as follows [74]: – Null action: Users provide no response to the initiated conversation. It is important to note that null action should not necessarily be construed as negative feedback, as users may find the initiation useful but may not desire further engagement. – Interruption or negation: Users respond in a manner consistent with ter- minating any further engagement by the generative retrieval system. It is perhaps safe to interpret such responses as negative feedback. – Relevant response: Users provide a pertinent response to the initiated inter- action, typically occurring when the interaction involves a question or solicits feedback. – Postpone: Users respond to the initiated conversation and request the system to remind them at a later time. –
