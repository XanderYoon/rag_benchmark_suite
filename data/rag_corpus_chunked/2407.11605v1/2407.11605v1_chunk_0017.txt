a conversation), (2) initiation purpose (why to initiate a conversation), and (3) initiation means (how to initiative a conversation). They identified five purposes for initiating interactions: (1) filtering streaming infor- mation, (2) context-aware recommendation, (3) following up a past user-system conversation, (4) contributing to a multi-party human conversation, and (5) re- questing feedback from users. A generic pipeline for these systems is depicted in Figure 2. In this pipeline, several algorithms constantly monitor the user’s context and information streams to produce conversation initiation instances, which are stored in a database. A conversation initiator component then selects an appropriate instance based on the situation, initiating a fluent and accurate utterance. Figure 2 is sufficiently generic for illustrating proactive interactions in generative retrieval models and we use it to describe research and open questions in proactive retrieval in more detail. Initiating a conversation through recommendation stands as one of the most common scenarios for proactive interaction. For instance, a conversational in- formation access system might suggest an item based on the user’s situational context, such as their location, time, and preferences. It is worth noting the distinction from traditional conversational recommendation setups, where users typically initiate the conversation by requesting specific items [66, 92]. Recent efforts in joint modeling of search and recommendation and developing unified information access systems [80, 81, 87] represent a step towards developing proac- tive, and thus mixed-initiative, systems in search and recommendation. However, proactive conversations extend beyond mere recommendations. For example, Avula and Arguello [9] devised a system for conducting wizard- of-oz experiments, investigating proactive interactions during conversational col- laborative search. This system could seamlessly integrate into collaborative plat- forms like Slack, 4 where during a collaborative search task, an external u ser (acting as a wizard) provides information. Though advancements in this area are nascent, there
