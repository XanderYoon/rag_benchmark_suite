needs and system’s capabilities. We describe such approaches in more detail in Proactive Feedback (Section 3). Overall, the key advantages of LLMs in assisting users at all four levels of information need are: – Natural Language Processing : LLMs can understand and respond to queries expressed in natural language, making them accessible even at the visceral and conscious need levels. – Contextual Understanding : Advanced LLMs can maintain context over multiple interactions, allowing for a more nuanced exploration of information needs. – Broad Knowledge Base : LLMs draw upon a vast range of information, potentially addressing needs across various domains and levels of specificity. – Adaptive Responses : LLMs can tailor their responses based on the per- ceived level of the user’s information need, understanding and responding to both simple and complex questions and providing more or less detail as appropriate. – Iterative Refinement : The conversational nature of LLMs interactions allows users to refine their queries progressively, moving from visceral to formalized needs through dialogue – Enhanced Expressiveness : Prompt-based interactions allow users to ex- press their needs in more nuanced and detailed ways. Users can specify the format, tone, and depth of the information they seek, which can lead to more tailored and useful outputs. For instance, users can request summaries, de- tailed explanations, comparisons, or creative content, depending on their needs. However, it’s important to note that while LLMs offer powerful capabilities in addressing information needs across Taylor’s levels, they also have limitations. They may sometimes provide plausible-sounding but incorrect information, lack true understanding of context beyond the immediate conversation, and cannot replace the critical thinking and expertise of human information professionals in complex scenarios. While LLMs can offer enhanced capabilities for expressing information needs, they also introduce new challenges. Such as Capability Gap: users may struggle
