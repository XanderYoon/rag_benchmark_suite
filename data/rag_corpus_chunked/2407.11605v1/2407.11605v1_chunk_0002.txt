using information, and how to support these activities. This fresh perspective has the potential to significantly transform user experience by enhancing how users ex- press their information needs and achieve their goals. We will frame our considerations using the information need model proposed by Robert Taylor in the 1960s [69, 70]. Taylor identified four levels of infor- mation need, each helping us to understand how users formulate questions in their minds, how they articulate them, and how they interact with informa- tion systems. The four levels of information need are: (1) Visceral Need: An inexpressible, unformulated need, felt as a vague sense of dissatisfaction, (2) Conscious Need : The user is aware of the need but cannot fully articulate it, (3) Formalized Need: The need can be clearly expressed and defined, (4) Compromised Need : The articulated need, as presented to an information system, often simplified or altered to fit the system’s capabilities. Traditional search systems typically support levels 3 and 4, but not 1 and 2. We believe that LLMs-based information access systems have the potential to support all four levels. Therefore, we use these four levels to structure our spec- ulative list of ways users could be assisted in their interactions with generative AI. We will draw, in part, on well-known information seeking models [45, 40]. Support for Visceral Need: (1) exploratory interactions: provide users with broad, exploratory dialogue that might help users clarify their thoughts; suggest related topics to help users better understand and articulate their needs. This is an example of Clarification which we describe in Section 5. (2) prompt sug- gestions: offer prompt suggestions or follow-up questions to guide users towards more specific questions. This is an example of Proactive Interactions which we describe in Section 6. Support for Conscious Need: (1) partial expression of
