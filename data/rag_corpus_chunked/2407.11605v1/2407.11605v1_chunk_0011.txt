best next action. For example, in conversa- tions where most humans would ask for refinement, LLMs fail to take the same action. Interactive challenges. As mentioned above, there has been research on various modes of refinement, i.e., search verticals, item attributes, faceted search, and example critique. While each of these modes has been utilized for a specific interaction medium (e.g., web search vs. conversational search), generative sys- tems could potentially mix them. For example, prompting the user about their preferred search result modality, rather than making an assumption. Moreover, Chen et al. [14] review the interactive challenges of LLMs in the light of per- sonalization, highlighting the importance of user–system interactions in result presentation, specifically refinement. Among other challenges, they refer to labo- rious data collection for training LLMs to be effective interactive systems, which can hinder the learning process. (a) (b) Fig. 1. Examples of search result refinement from Amazon.com. The refinement panes on the left help users browse through the search results. 5 Clarification In a generative retrieval setting where the system aims to provide a comprehen- sive response to the user, whether in a conversational or web search setting, it is of utmost importance to ensure that the user’s intent is predicted with high confidence. This is particularly critical, as in traditional web search scenarios, the system would diversify the list of results to ensure that various facets or interpretations of the query are covered in the top results [57]. However, in a generative scenario, usually, a single answer is provided to the user, limiting the information that can be exchanged between the user and the system. 5.1 An Overview of Search Clarification Clarifying questions have been studied extensively [34] in the context of conver- sational question-answering [52], information-seeking conversations [5], and web search [82].
