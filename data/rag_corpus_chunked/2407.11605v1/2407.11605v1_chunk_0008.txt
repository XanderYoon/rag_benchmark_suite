systems. Research in understanding and modeling implicit (negative) feedback is rel- atively sparse and future technologies can greatly benefit from further research in this space. 4 Result Refinement 4.1 An Overview of Result Refinement Result refinement is relatively understudied, compared to other modes of inter- action in generative IR. Search result refinement has a long history of research in IR, especially in areas such as information filtering (e.g., recommender systems) where users access semi-structured information [16]. Figure 1 shows an example search result page from Amazon.com, where users are able to select certain at- tributes of the items (e.g., size) in the catalog to narrow down the results being presented to them. Search result refinement for semi-structured data is a rela- tively trivial task, as the refinement pane usually concerns the most important attributes of the items, given the query and the top item list. In the preference- based search literature, example-critiquing approaches have been explored [73], where the model suggests examples to the user, and with the user’s feedback, it then models the user’s preference. In conversational recommender systems, a similar approach is taken as part of the preference elicitation process [37]. In this process, the conversational system starts the conversation by asking the user’s opinion about movies, aiming to optimize the decision space. A similar approach is taken in conversational product recommendation [97, 96]. In these works, the high-level idea is to extract important attributes from user reviews of products and model a probabilistic decision space. Then the conversational system takes a greedy approach in which, at every step, it aims to ask about an item attribute that minimizes the uncertainty of the decision space. Search result refinement is more challenging in web search, where the system deals with unstructured data. One of the earliest, simplest, and yet
