based on a single attribute of the item is less trivial. To address this challenge, several works study controllable recommendation via disentanglement [17], where the goal is to represent items as separated attribute vectors instead of a single latent vector. Some of these at- tributes would be mapped to actual attributes in the catalog (e.g., color, style), or some latent attributes. LLMs have shown to be capable of extracting query facets, relying solely on their intrinsic knowledge [41]. However, as shown in the literature, LLMs are not yet capable of effectively grounding [63], which leads to suboptimal planning of LLMs utilizing their intrinsic knowledge to take the best next action. For example, for cases where humans would As the items or docu- ments are being represented using model parameters, refining the results based on a single attribute of the item is less trivial.

For example, in conversa- tions where most humans would ask for refinement, LLMs fail to take the same action. Interactive challenges. As mentioned above, there has been research on various modes of refinement, i.e., search verticals, item attributes, faceted search, and example critique. While each of these modes has been utilized for a specific interaction medium (e.g.,
