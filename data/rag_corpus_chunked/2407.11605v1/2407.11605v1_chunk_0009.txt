of products and model a probabilistic decision space. Then the conversational system takes a greedy approach in which, at every step, it aims to ask about an item attribute that minimizes the uncertainty of the decision space. Search result refinement is more challenging in web search, where the system deals with unstructured data. One of the earliest, simplest, and yet most effective ways is using vertical in the search result page [8]. Search result verticals divide the search results based on very high-level categories, such as images, videos, and news. Even though, very high level, it still can be considered as a na¨ ıve approach to refinement, as it approaches the user information from the result type. In most cases, the same user query can be satisfied with different modalities, which turns out to be one of the most important aspects of search, hence major commercial search engines still employ this approach. Finally, some early approaches tried to diversify, but also refine search results based on automatically extracted infor- mation facets. Faceted search [72] provides a means of navigation through topic facets for the users, enabling them to narrow down their information needs, as well as the search space. These early systems mainly relied on automatic facet extractors [36]. 4.2 Technical Challenges In the generative era, result refinement faces both algorithmic and interactive challenges. Algorithmic challenges. As the items or documents are being represented using model parameters, refining the results based on a single attribute of the item is less trivial. To address this challenge, several works study controllable recommendation via disentanglement [17], where the goal is to represent items as separated attribute vectors instead of a single latent vector. Some of these at- tributes would be mapped to actual attributes in the catalog (e.g., color, style), or some latent
