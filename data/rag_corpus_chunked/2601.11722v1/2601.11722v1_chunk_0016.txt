fromp uncond. Table 4 shows an example from ClariQ, where noise increases withα. Irrelevant spans (highlighted in red ) illustrate how higherαdegrades faithfulness. For prefer- ence learning, selecting intermediateαvalues yields negative examples that are challenging yet informative, avoiding both trivial and overly noisy supervision. Generated Clarifying questions.We compare clarifications fromRAC SF T andRAC DP O on ClariQ validation data (Table 5). Faithful content is high- lighted in yellow , hallucinations inred .RAC SF T exhibits occasional ground- ing failures, such as introducing unsupported entities (e.g., hallucinating “season 17”) or omitting relevant evidence (e.g., overlooking “season 16”). In contrast, RACDP O produces questions more tightly grounded in passages.
