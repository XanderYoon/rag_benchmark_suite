5.1 Main Results The main evaluation results are reported in Table 1. We find thatRACsig- nificantly outperforms the baselines across all metrics and datasets, confirming that passage conditioning substantially improves clarifying question generation, answeringRQ2. Moreover, results show that reference-based measures fail to capture the gains from preference tuning, consistent with prior findings [4,6,23]. In contrast, reference-free evaluation –reported only for models conditionned with passages– reveals thatRAC DPO achieves better performance overRACSFT. This demon- strates that preference-based optmization enhances corpus faithfulness beyond sepervised fine-tuning, directly adressingRQ3. The fact that QP-Zero performs significantly worse than Q-cond highlights the importance of learning the form of a clarification question, independently of its content.
