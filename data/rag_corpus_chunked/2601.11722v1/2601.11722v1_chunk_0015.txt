Retrieval-Augmented Clarification for Faithful CS 11 Table 3: ClariQ validation results using different negative generation methods.

This contrast makes them harder negatives and better training signals for preference optimization. By comparison, samples frompLM often fail to resemble clarifications at all, limiting their usefulness. These results highlight the importance of tailoring noise generation to the clarification format rather than reusing generic base-model outputs. 5.5 Qualitative Analysis Noisy clarifying questions.We qualitatively assess the effect of mixture be- tween the conditionned & unconditionned modelspθ0 andp uncond, controlled by α(Eq.3). Atα= 0, outputs come solely frompθ0; atα= 1, fromp uncond. Table 4 shows an example from ClariQ, where noise increases withα. Irrelevant spans (highlighted in red ) illustrate how higherαdegrades faithfulness. For prefer- ence learning, selecting intermediateαvalues yields negative examples that are challenging yet informative, avoiding both trivial and overly noisy supervision.
