validate our approach on conversational search and open-domain Question Answering datasets through automatic metrics and LLM-as-Judge evaluations. Results show that RAC consistently enhances both the quality and faithfulness of clarifying questions, outperforming existing baselines. 2 Related Work Query Clarification in Conversational Search.Askingclarifyingquestions enables users to actively participate in query disambiguation, with the goal of better capturing their information intent [1,2,7,11]. Prior work in this area has primarily focused on two tasks: predicting the need for clarification and gener- ating clarifying questions. In this paper, we focus on the latter. Recent studies have increasingly explored large language model based approaches. For instance, Sekulić et al. [27] conditioned an LLM on specific facets; however, such facets are not always readily available and often require external extraction tools. Siro et al. [28] leveraged temperature control and facet information to generate diverse clarifications, while Wang et al. [30] introduced a zero-shot clarifying-question generator using fixed templates and query facets. More recently, Tang et al. [29] proposed a prompting strategy grounded in an ambiguity taxonomy to improve handling of ambiguous queries. Although these methods produce plausible and diverse clarifications, they remain prone to hallucination, frequently generating questions about aspects unsupported by the underlying corpus. Additionally, the reliance on explicit facets limits applicability when facets are difficult to extract or unavailable. Retrieval Augmented Generation.Since the original article [12], several variants have been proposed, first for question answering [9] and later for clar- ification. Early studies primarily examined the role of the retriever in selecting corpus-grounded clarifications among candidate suggestions [18], whereas more recent work has shifted the focus toward generation [10], with particular atten- tion to maximizing faithfulness during inference. In addition, [26] demonstrates that the RAG paradigm can be combined with knowledge bases to enhance dis- ambiguation in domain-specific applications. However, these approaches rely on
