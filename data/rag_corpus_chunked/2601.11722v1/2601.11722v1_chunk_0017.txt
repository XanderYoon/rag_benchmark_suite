This formulation ensures that clarifications are grounded in information the system can realistically access. Our RAC framework combines retrieval context with preference tuning to improve both the relevance and corpus-faithfulness of generated questions. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that both RACSFT and RACDPO significantly outperform existing baselines, Q-Cond and QP-Zeroshot, across all reference-based metrics (ROUGE- L, BLEU, METEOR, and BERTScore). We further employ
