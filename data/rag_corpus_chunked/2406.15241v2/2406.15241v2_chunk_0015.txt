Word Embeddings: The key diﬀerence between the baseline static word embedding approach in Section 3.6 and this baseline approach is the absence of weights in the input to be classi/f_ied. This means we compared each class label to the average vector represen- tation of words in the original input text. We accessed the text-embedding-3 small and large models through the OpenAI API7 in March 2024. while the All-mpnet-base-v2 model was accessed via hugging face 8. We use All-mpnet to denote the All-mpnet base-v2 model, while TE-3-small and TE-3-large are used to denote text-embedding-3 small and large models, respectively, throughout the manuscript. Unlike the All-mpnet base-v2 model, with a 512-token limit, OpenAI models can handle longer inputs. To ensure consistency and address the 512-token limit across all models, we employed the GPT-2 tokenizer 9 when reformulating queries. 4.3 Retrieval Models To retrieve supporting categories, we explored two methods: a dense and a sparse retriever. The sparse retriever utilized the BM25 [26] algorithm implemented in Pyterrier [19] with default settings. For the dense retriever, we employed the Contriever [11] model, trained speci/f_ically on Wikipedia passages. The BEIR [30] frame- work enabled indexing and retrieval for the Contriever model. 5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 5.1 Eﬀect of Retrieval Augmentation on Zero-shot Performance Table 4 showcases the bene/f_its of the retrieval augmentation pipeline (QZero), demonstrating performance improvements across all model sizes, especially in News topic classi/f_ication datasets.
