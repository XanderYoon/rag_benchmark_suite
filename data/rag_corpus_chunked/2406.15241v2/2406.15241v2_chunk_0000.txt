A simple approach often relies on comparing embeddings of query (text) to those of potential classes. However, the embeddings of a simple query sometimes lack rich contextual information, which hinders the classi/f_ication performance. Traditionally, this has been addressed by improving the embedding model with expensive train- ing. We introduce QZero, a novel training-free knowledge augmen- tation approach that reformulates queries by retrieving supporting categories from Wikipedia to improve zero-shot text classi/f_ication performance. Our experiments across six diverse datasets demon- strate that QZero enhances performance for state-of-the-art static and contextual embedding models without the need for retrain- ing. Notably, in News and medical topic classi/f_ication tasks, QZero improves the performance of even the largest OpenAI embedding model by at least 5% and 3%, respectively. Acting as a knowledge ampli/f_ier, QZero enables small word embedding models to achieve performance levels comparable to those of larger contextual models, oﬀering the potential for signi/f_icant computational savings. Addi- tionally, QZero oﬀers meaningful insights that illuminate query context and verify topic relevance, aiding in understanding model predictions. Overall, QZero improves embedding-based zero-shot classi/f_iers while maintaining their simplicity. This makes it particu- larly valuable for resource-constrained environments and domains with constantly evolving information. 1 CCS CONCEPTS • Information systems → Clustering and classi/f_ication.
