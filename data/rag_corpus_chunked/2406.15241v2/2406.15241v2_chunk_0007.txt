Figure 1: Overview of the Retrieval Augmented Zero-Shot Classi/f_ication Pipeline. Before classi/f_ication, given a raw input query, QZero generates a new re/f_ined query by retrieving categories of Wikipedia articles that best match the original input query. The parts of the input query highlighted in purple and red represent entities that may require context information. The re/f_ined query provides the context information that may be useful for the classi/f_ication process. to the query itself, serving as a form of query expansion. This ap- proach improves the performance of generative language models on various tasks without further training the entire model. In addi- tion, retrieval systems excel at handling new information eﬃciently, allowing for quick updates when new information arrives. Inspired by these studies, we investigate whether a similar retrieval strat- egy can improve the performance of text embedding models for zero-shot text classi/f_ication tasks. Notably, while retrieval has been explored for text embeddings before (e.g., ERATE [24]), our objectives diﬀer. ERATE tackles the computational burden of creating rich document embeddings from a complex model by utilizing retrieval to /f_ind similar pre-computed high-quality embeddings based on document representations from a lightweight model. In contrast, QZero aims to enhance the zero-shot classi/f_ication quality of embedding models by retrieving relevant categories from external sources to enrich the context of queries before classi/f_ication. In other words, QZero improves embeddings by reformulating the original query, while ERATE improves em- beddings by approximating the embeddings of a large, complex model. 2.4 Query Enrichment and Expansion Query enrichment, the process of reformulating or augmenting a query with supplementary information, has been widely explored in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks as a means to enhance semantic understanding and overall performance. While earlier research predominantly concentrated on its utility in information retrieval tasks [37, 6, 32, 14, 4], recent investigations
