Furthermore, QZero enhances the performance of smaller models to match their larger counterparts. Beyond improving classi/f_ication accuracy, QZero incorporates relevant information from Wikipedia articles, providing valuable insights into the context of queries and validating their pertinence to speci/f_ic topics. This dual functionality strengthens the rationale behind model predictions, leading to more reliable and trustworthy classi/f_ication outcomes. In summary, QZero improves the perfor- mance of embedding-based zero-shot classi/f_iers while maintaining their simplicity, paving a promising path for more eﬃcient and interpretable zero-shot classi/f_ication techniques. While QZero shows promise, there are limitations that require future exploration. First, the current query reformulation process for contextual embedding models could bene/f_it from further re/f_ine- ment. Secondly, there might be cases where the model’s knowledge is simply insuﬃcient, and query reformulation alone would not be enough to improve performance. Lastly, our experiments focused on embedding models. Investigating whether query reformulation or other forms of retrieval augmented learning can bene/f_it other models, such as those for natural language inference or generation, would be an interesting avenue to explore.
