for zero-shot classi/f_ication tasks. However, their immense size and computational demands limit their accessibility and eﬃciency for resource-constrained environments. In addition, these models tend to make predictions outside the scope of user- de/f_ined classes, hindering the model’s applicability in scenarios where class-based predictions are required. 2.2 Zero-shot Text Classi/f_ication via Semantic Comparison Beyond large generative models, an alternative approach leverages embedding techniques to compare semantic similarity between the text and potential classes during classi/f_ication. This approach involves encoding textual information, like words or sentences, into vector spaces using innovative methods like [21, 2, 29, 25]. Pi- oneering work by [5] and [8] laid the groundwork for this strategy. However, early embedding techniques had limitations in accuracy because of their reliance on simple modeling approaches, hindering their ability to eﬀectively capture the nuanced relationships and semantic context within textual data. Recent research by [7] and [15] addressed this by /f_ine-tuning pre-trained models with exter- nal knowledge sources like Wikipedia to improve the embedding quality for zero-shot classi/f_ication. Although cheaper, these meth- ods don’t entirely eliminate the need for retraining, which can be challenging for rapidly evolving domains. 2.3 Retrieval Augmented Learning To alleviate the need for retraining, recent studies like [28, 31] have explored retrieval-augmented approaches. These methods leverage external information by retrieving documents relevant to the query at inference time. These retrieved documents are then prepended Retrieval Augmented Zero-Shot Text Classification ICTIR ’24, July 13, 2024, Washington DC, DC, USA Figure 1: Overview of the Retrieval Augmented Zero-Shot Classi/f_ication Pipeline. Before classi/f_ication, given a raw input query, QZero generates a new re/f_ined query by retrieving categories of Wikipedia articles that best match the original input query. The parts of the input query highlighted in purple and red represent entities that may require context information. The re/f_ined query provides the context
