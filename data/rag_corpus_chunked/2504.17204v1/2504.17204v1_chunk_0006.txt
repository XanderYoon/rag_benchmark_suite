and questions the purpose of the medication. Emma confidently states that it is used to lower blood pressure. At this point, Factually vibrates, alerting the users to a potential error. The device provides a tactile cue, prompting the wearer to check the accompanying feedback: Neurontin is a medication used to help manage epileptic seizures. With this information, Grace points out the error, avoiding a potential health risk. This scenario demonstrates Factually’s ability to extend perceptual capabilities by identifying incorrect statements and providing accurate information in real time. By doing so, it enhances user awareness and helps prevent potentially harmful misunderstandings. 3.3.2 Scenario 2: Social Conversations. In this scenario, we assess the role of factually in a casual social setting. Two friends are having lunch and discussing Taylor Swift. One claims that Taylor Swift can speak Chinese, while the other disagrees, leading to a playful bet: the loser will pay for lunch. The first individual finds a YouTube video appearing to show Taylor Swift speaking Mandarin. However,Factually vibrates subtly, allowing the user to access the feedback: while Taylor Swift does not speak Mandarin, there is a highly realistic deepfake depicting her doing so. Armed with this information, the user refutes the claim, shifting the outcome of the bet. This scenario illustrates how Factually’s wearable and tactile design supports its seamless integration into social interactions. By aligning with familiar gestures, such as glancing at a wrist or adjusting a wearable device, Factually remains inconspicuous while providing timely and actionable information. 2Concept Video Link Factually: Exploring Wearable Fact-Checking for Augmented Truth Discernment 5 Fig. 3.
