remains inconspicuous while providing timely and actionable information. 2Concept Video Link Factually: Exploring Wearable Fact-Checking for Augmented Truth Discernment 5 Fig. 3. Use-Case Scenarios of Factually. (A) Scenario 1: health-related misinformation detection during a conversation between two grand daughters. (B) Scenario 2: misinformation detection during a casual lunch conversation. (C) Scenario 3: misinformation detection during learning. 3.3.3 Scenario 3: Everyday Learning. In this scenario, we evaluate the role of Factually in learning. A parent is helping their child with homework. The child asks if dinosaurs lived alongside humans. The parent confidently responds affirmatively. Factually vibrates, prompting the parent to consult the device’s feedback: dinosaurs went extinct 65 million years before humans appeared. Armed with this new information, the parent corrects their statement, encouraging a more accurate understanding of history. This scenario highlights how Factually encourages users to question the validity of their claims and practice mindfulness in speech. By promoting introspection and self-correction, Factually fosters a truth-centered identity and critical thinking. 3.4 Initial User Reactions We presented Factually to 10 potential users to get their initial qualitative feedback. Overall, participants foundFactually intuitive and useful, particularly appreciating its non-intrusive nature. They expressed interest in using such a system in their daily lives, citing its potential to enhance critical thinking and mindfulness. However, they also suggested improvements in the vibrotactile feedback’s specificity and the ability to customize the system’s sensitivity to different topics. 4 LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK The current prototype ofFactually employs general-purpose large language models and web-based resources, which may not always produce domain-specific or highly accurate results. Future implementations would incorporate specialized fact-checking models trained on misinformation datasets to enhance reliability. Factually relies on cloud-based fact-checking using large language models and web resources, but network latency can delay real-time feedback. Future versions could address this by incorporating edge computing
