While Factiverse targets media platforms, Factually focuses on augmenting individual users’ cognitive abilities in real-world, conversational scenarios. 3 FACTUALLY 3.1 Design considerations in the Assistive Augmentation space The design of the Factually is inspoired by the principles of assistive augmentation, as outlined by Tan et al. [12]. They introduce assistive augmentation as a paradigm that enhances human capabilities along two primary dimensions: ability (expanding cognitive and sensory capacities) and integration (seamlessly embedding augmentation into everyday life). We design Factually so that it embodies these dimensions in the context of misinformation detection and truth discernment, in the following way: Ability Dimension: Factually augments human cognitive capabilities by providing real-time feedback about potentially false information. It empowers users to discern truth more effectively during conversations, addressing the cognitive overload often associated with manual fact-checking. The system’s vibrational feedback mechanism enables users to extend their perceptual limits, allowing for quick and intuitive recognition of misinformation. This aligns with the ability dimension of assistive augmentation, where tools amplify human cognition without replacing human judgment. Integration Dimension: The integration dimension emphasizes the importance of embedding augmentation seamlessly into users’ daily lives.Factually achieves this through its wearable design, which uses discreet tactile feedback instead of disruptive auditory or visual cues. Whether integrated into a smartwatch or a smart ring, Factually ensures that users remain engaged in social interactions without drawing attention to the system’s operation. Its subtle design makes it particularly suitable for naturalistic settings, such as casual conversations or collaborative environments, where overt fact-checking would be impractical or socially awkward. 4Chitralekha Gupta, Hanjun Wu, Praveen Sasikumar, Shreyas Sridhar, Priambudi Bagaskara, and Suranga Nanayakkara 3.2 System Design Our proof-of-concept system consists of the following components, as shown in Figure 2: • Wearable Interface: Factually integrated into common wearable device (e.g. smartwatch).
