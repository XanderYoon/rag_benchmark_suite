how individuals engage with information. Through initial qualitative demonstrations, we highlight Factually’s promise as an effective tool for fostering truth-centered behaviors and enhancing human cognition in socially integrated ways. 2 RELATED WORK Factually builds upon a growing body of research in misinformation detection, assistive augmentation [12], and wearable technologies, extending these fields by addressing the challenges of real-time fact-checking in social contexts. Several key studies have advanced our understanding of misinformation, particularly the cognitive and social processes that underpin its spread and persistence. Lewandowsky et al. have made significant contributions to this field, exploring why individuals believe misinformation and the challenges of correcting it. For instance, [5] demonstrated that while explicit warnings can reduce the impact of misinformation, they often fail to eliminate its lasting effects. Similarly, Blank’s work on "double misinformation" [1] shows how misinformation can confuse people and distort their understanding of events. Blank’s earlier work [2] on the social construction of memory further explains how misinformation impacts the formation of false memories. These impactful contributions, alongside studies like [ 6] work on the "continued influence effect" and [4] analysis of misinformation dynamics online, emphasize the complex interaction of psychological and social factors in the spread of misinformation and provide valuable insights into strategies for mitigation. 2.1 Misinformation Detection and Cognitive Augmentation Kozyreva et al. [7, 8] discuss interventions aimed at combating misinformation and emphasize the importance of timely cognitive support. Pennycook et al. [9] examine the role of cognitive reflection in discerning truth and demonstrate that nudges to encourage reflective thinking can mitigate the spread of misinformation. Through factually, we align with these principles by providing real-time fact-checking assistance, and employ subtle, tactile cues that prompt introspection and self-correction without disrupting conversations. 2.2 Wearables for Misinformation Detection Wearable technologies have increasingly been employed as tools for augmenting
