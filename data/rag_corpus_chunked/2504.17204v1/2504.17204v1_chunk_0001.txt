unavoidable challenge in the digital age, with bite-sized falsehoods spreading rapidly across social media platforms and casual conversations. Fact-checking in real-time is inherently inconvenient, often socially awkward, and prone to being forgotten. Despite the rise of automated fact-checking systems, existing solutions typically require active engagement, such as searching for questionable claims, which disrupts natural conversations. This paper was presented at the 2025 ACM Workshop on Human-AI Interaction for Augmented Reasoning (AIREASONING-2025-01).

Factually integrates with everyday wearable devices such as smartwatches or rings to provide real-time, discreet feedback through vibrations when potentially false information is detected. The aim of Factually aligns with the goals of assistive augmentation [12] where it enhances cognitive capabilities in naturalistic settings, blending immediacy and social integration into an intuitive system. Our work builds on the broader vision of using wearable technologies to amplify human abilities, with a specific focus on tackling misinformation. In this paper, we describe the design of Factually, its implementation using existing fact-checking mechanisms, and its potential to transform how individuals engage with information. Through initial qualitative demonstrations, we highlight Factually’s promise as an effective tool for fostering truth-centered behaviors and enhancing human cognition in socially integrated ways. 2 RELATED WORK Factually builds upon a growing body of research in misinformation detection, assistive augmentation [12], and wearable technologies, extending these fields by addressing the challenges of real-time fact-checking in
