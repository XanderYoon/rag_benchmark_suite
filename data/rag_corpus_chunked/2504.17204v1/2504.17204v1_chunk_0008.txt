employs general-purpose large language models and web-based resources, which may not always produce domain-specific or highly accurate results. Future implementations would incorporate specialized fact-checking models trained on misinformation datasets to enhance reliability. Factually relies on cloud-based fact-checking using large language models and web resources, but network latency can delay real-time feedback. Future versions could address this by incorporating edge computing or on-device inference for faster response times. While Factually ’s discreet vibrotactile feedback minimizes social disruptions, broader and long-term usability studies are needed to assess its practicality in diverse social contexts to guage its social acceptibility as well as its impact on 6Chitralekha Gupta, Hanjun Wu, Praveen Sasikumar, Shreyas Sridhar, Priambudi Bagaskara, and Suranga Nanayakkara user’s cognitive load. Investigating the ethical implications of real-time fact-checking systems, such as privacy concerns and the potential for misuse, will be vital to ensure responsible deployment.
