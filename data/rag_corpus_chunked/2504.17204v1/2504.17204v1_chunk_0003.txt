of cognitive reflection in discerning truth and demonstrate that nudges to encourage reflective thinking can mitigate the spread of misinformation. Through factually, we align with these principles by providing real-time fact-checking assistance, and employ subtle, tactile cues that prompt introspection and self-correction without disrupting conversations. 2.2 Wearables for Misinformation Detection Wearable technologies have increasingly been employed as tools for augmenting human cognitive and sensory abilities. The Wearable Reasoner explored the use of explainable AI to enhance rational decision-making by providing verbal feedback through a wearable device [3]. While effective in delivering justifications for decisions, its focus on audio-based interactions raises practical challenges in socially sensitive scenarios. Factually addresses these limitations by relying on non-verbal tactile feedback, ensuring seamless integration into conversations. Factually builds on the foundation of assistive augmentation [12], which envisions wearable technologies as transformative tools for expanding human capabilities. Factually: Exploring Wearable Fact-Checking for Augmented Truth Discernment 3 Fig. 2. Overview of the Technical Implementation. 2.3 Real-time Fact Checking Fact-checking systems have traditionally focused on web-based or multimedia platforms, with limited attention to conversational contexts. For example, Rashkin et al. [10] propose a language model-based system to detect false claims in online text. While effective in structured environments, such solutions are less applicable to dynamic, interpersonal interactions. Factually bridges this gap by operating as a wearable assistant capable of on-the-fly fact verification during conversations. Similarly, Setty et al. [11] introduce Factiverse, a live fact-checking tool for online applications. While Factiverse targets media platforms, Factually focuses on augmenting individual users’ cognitive abilities in real-world, conversational scenarios. 3 FACTUALLY 3.1 Design considerations in the Assistive Augmentation space The design of the Factually is inspoired by the principles of assistive augmentation, as outlined by Tan et al. [12]. They introduce assistive augmentation as a paradigm that enhances human capabilities along two
