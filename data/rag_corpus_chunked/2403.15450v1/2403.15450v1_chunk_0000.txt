Loops On Retrieval Augmented Generation (LoRAG) 1st Ayush Thakur Amity Institute of Information Technology Amity University Noida, India ayush.th2002@gmail.com 2nd Rashmi Vashisth Amity Institute of Information Technology Amity University Noida, India rvashisth@amity.edu Abstract—This paper presents Loops On Retrieval Augmented Generation (LoRAG), a new framework designed to enhance the quality of retrieval-augmented text generation through the incorporation of an iterative loop mechanism. The architecture integrates a generative model, a retrieval mechanism, and a dynamic loop module, allowing for iterative refinement of the generated text through interactions with relevant information retrieved from the input context. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that LoRAG surpasses existing state-of-the-art models in terms of BLEU score, ROUGE score, and perplexity, showcasing its effectiveness in achieving both coherence and relevance in generated text. The qualitative assessment further illustrates LoRAG’s capability to produce contextually rich and coherent outputs. This research contributes valuable insights into the potential of iterative loops in mitigating challenges in text generation, positioning LoRAG as a promising advancement in the field.

I NTRODUCTION In recent years, there has been notable progress in natural language processing (NLP), particularly in the field of text generation. An area of particular interest is the combination of retrieval methods with generative models to improve the quality and relevance of generated content [4]. Retrieval- augmented generation seeks to capitalize on the strengths of both generative and retrieval-based approaches, striving to achieve a balance between creativity and coherence [5]. In this vein, we introduce a new framework called Loops On Retrieval augmented generation (LoRAG). The LoRAG framework aims to tackle the challenges encountered by conventional generative models, such as maintaining coher- ence, relevance, and informativeness in the generated text. By integrating loops into the retrieval process, LoRAG endeavors to
