and retrieved data, enabling the model to refine its output in a contextually sensitive manner. The iterative loops are governed by the following equation: P (yt|x, y<t) = LoRAG(y<t, Retrieve(x)) In this equation, P (yt|x, y<t) denotes the probability dis- tribution of the next token yt given the context x and the previously generated sequence y<t. The function Retrieve (x) retrieves pertinent information from the input context, which is then incorporated into the generation process by the function LoRAG. Furthermore, the loop mechanism is enhanced through the utilization of a reinforcement learning objective: J(θ) = TX t=1 E(x,y) [r(yt, y<t, x) · ∇θ log P (yt|x, y<t; θ)] Here, J(θ) represents the reinforcement learning objective, r(yt, y<t, x) is the reward function, and θ denotes the model parameters. This fusion of retrieval, loops, and reinforcement learning sets LoRAG apart as an innovative approach in the realm of text generation models. III. L ORAG F RAMEWORK The LoRAG framework is crafted to elevate retrieval- augmented text generation by integrating iterative loops. In this segment, we elucidate the architecture, constituents, and operational flow of the LoRAG model. A. Architecture The LoRAG architecture comprises three primary compo- nents: the generative model, the retrieval mechanism, and the iterative loop module. Figure 1 depicts the overall architecture of LoRAG. The generative model processes the input context x and produces the initial output y. Concurrently, the retrieval mech- anism retrieves pertinent information from the input context, supplying additional context C to the iterative loop module. Subsequently, the iterative loop module enhances the gener- ated output through multiple interactions with the retrieved information. Fig. 1: LoRAG Architecture B. Iterative Loop Mechanism The core component of LoRAG is its iterative loop mech- anism, which facilitates the progressive enhancement of gen- erated text. The mechanism entails the following steps:
