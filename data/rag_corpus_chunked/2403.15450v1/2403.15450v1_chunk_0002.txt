strides have been taken to enhance the relevance, coherence, and informativeness of generated text. A. Retrieval-augmented Generation Models Early efforts to integrate retrieval mechanisms with gener- ative models include techniques like the Dual Encoder archi- tecture [7], [13], which employs distinct encoders for context and response. The context encoder handles input information, while the response encoder generates the output. Despite their effectiveness, these models frequently encounter difficulties in managing long-context dependencies and preserving coherent conversations. B. Transformer-based Approaches Recent progress in transformer-based architectures has fa- cilitated the emergence of models such as DialoGPT [8], [14], which utilizes a large-scale pretrained language model for dialogue generation. Transformer-based models [3] have demonstrated encouraging outcomes in capturing contextual cues and enhancing the coherence of generated text. Neverthe- less, they may encounter challenges with relevance and factual precision, particularly in dynamic conversational contexts. arXiv:2403.15450v1 [cs.CL] 18 Mar 2024 C. Loop Mechanisms in Text Generation The concept of iterative loops in text generation has been investigated across different contexts. Loop models, such as those implemented in reinforcement learning frameworks [9], utilize iterative mechanisms to enhance the quality of generated outputs. These methodologies have exhibited effec- tiveness in improving both fluency and coherence. However, their integration within the framework of retrieval-augmented generation represents an area ripe for exploration. D. LoRAG Framework The LoRAG framework introduces a pioneering methodol- ogy by integrating iterative loops into the retrieval-augmented generation procedure. This involves numerous interactions between the generative model and retrieved data, enabling the model to refine its output in a contextually sensitive manner. The iterative loops are governed by the following equation: P (yt|x, y<t) = LoRAG(y<t, Retrieve(x)) In this equation, P (yt|x, y<t) denotes the probability dis- tribution of the next token yt given the context x and the previously generated sequence y<t. The function Retrieve (x)
