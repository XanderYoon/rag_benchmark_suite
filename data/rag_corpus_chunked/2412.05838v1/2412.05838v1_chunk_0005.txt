industries like healthcare and finance, where data privacy and regulatory compliance are critical. Local deployment ensures that no sensitive data leaves the premises, mitigating risks associated with data breaches. However, these models require substantial computational resources, including high-performance GPUs, for efficient operation, which can increase the cost and complexity of deployment.[5, 2]. API-based LLMs, such as OpenAI’s GPT models and Google’s Gemini family, are hosted on cloud platforms and eliminate the need for maintaining extensive infrastructure. They are easy to integrate, benefit from continuous updates, and provide high scalability, making them ideal for applications requiring dynamic workloads. Despite these advantages, API-based models introduce concerns regarding data privacy, as sensitive information must be transmitted to external servers for processing. Additionally, their token-based pricing models can lead to unpredictable costs for applications with heavy usage. [6, 7] Token constraints further influence the choice of LLMs in RAG systems. Both local and API-based models impose limits on the amount of data that can be processed in a single query, necessitating the use of efficient data chunking and retrieval techniques. Table 1 summarizes the key characteristics of various local and API-based LLMs, focusing on their context lengths and providers.

Local models are better suited for scenarios where data privacy and control are paramount, while API-based models excel in environments that demand scalability and ease of integration.
