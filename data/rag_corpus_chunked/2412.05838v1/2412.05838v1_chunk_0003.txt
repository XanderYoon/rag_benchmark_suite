if the user asks, “What is the role of AI and ML in the XYZ development team?” the system needs to retrieve private context, such as “The XYZ team uses AI for predictive analytics and natural language processing,” to provide a tailored and meaningful response. The integration of retrieved context with generative capabilities ensures that the outputs are both accurate and relevant. Traditional RAG Systems, which rely on single-agent architectures, face challenges in managing multiple data sources. These systems are prone to inefficiencies, including token overload and inaccurate query generation, especially when handling diverse data storage types. The need for a more scalable and efficient approach has led to the development of the Multi-Agent RAG system. 2.2 Agents and Multi-Agent RAG Systems In a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [3] system, a single agent [21] is capable of handling query generation and data retrieval for multiple types of databases, including relational, document-based, and graph data sources [19]. However, this approach demands that the agent be equipped with a comprehensive schema, detailed examples, and extensive knowledge of diverse database structures. This complexity can lead to inefficiencies such as slower query generation, token overhead, and a higher likelihood of errors in query formation. Additionally, relying on a single agent to process heterogeneous data increases the risk of misinterpretation, resulting in incorrect or suboptimal queries. These limitations often hinder the scalability and performance of systems operating in diverse data environments. The Multi-Agent [22, 23] RAG system resolves these challenges by delegating tasks to specialized agents, each tailored to handle a specific type of database. For example, a MySQL agent is responsible for generating optimized SQL queries for relational databases [10], while a MongoDB agent specializes in document-based data retrieval. By focusing solely 2 on one database type, each agent can generate precise and efficient queries,
