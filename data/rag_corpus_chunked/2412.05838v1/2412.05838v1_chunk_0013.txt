to the generative model, we improve the quality of outputs while reducing unnecessary or irrelevant information. 3.4.5 Synthesizing Data for Rich Responses Once data is retrieved, a generative component creates detailed and meaningful responses by merging information from multiple sources. This step ensures that user queries are addressed comprehensively, resulting in responses that are both logical and contextually rich. 3.4.6 Error Handling for Robust Performance Our system includes mechanisms to detect and address errors during query execution. When an issue arises, it automatically switches to fallback methods to ensure that users receive reliable results, even in challenging scenarios. 3.4.7 Reducing Token Overhead By distributing tasks among specialized agents, we limit the token consumption for individual queries. This modular approach allows the system to handle more complex tasks within predefined token constraints, improving its scalability. 3.4.8 Adaptable Across Industries The system can adapt to different database types and environments without requiring major changes. Its flexibility makes it suitable for applications in fields like healthcare, finance, and logistics, where seamless integration with diverse data sources is essential. 3.4.9 Efficient Use of Resources By distributing workloads among agents and using a single generative model for synthesis, we significantly reduce computational requirements. This efficiency is particularly beneficial in real-time applications or environments with limited processing power. 3.4.10 Improving Query Accuracy Each agent’s expertise ensures that database queries are tailored and handled with high precision. By collaborating, the agents reduce context loss, resulting in more accurate and meaningful responses. 8 3.4.11 Enabling Future Research in Multi-Agent Systems This work highlights the potential of multi-agent collaboration for enhancing retrieval-augmented generation. By exploring agent specialization and synthesis, we provide a stepping stone for further advancements in this area. Through these contributions, we address the limitations of existing approaches and demonstrate how intelligent, specialized systems can enable more
