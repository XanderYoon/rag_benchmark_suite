query, Quser, and the retrieved data, Rquery, to produce the final output, Aresponse. The response could take many forms, depending on the user’s request, such as structured text, tables, or graphs. The equation describing the relationship between the user query, the retrieved data, and the final response is: Aresponse = hgen(Quser, Rquery) This ensures that the response is not only accurate but also contextually relevant, addressing the user’s needs based on the data retrieved from various sources. 5.1.4 Agent Specialization Agent specialization is a core feature of the proposed system, as each agent is specifically designed to handle a certain type of data or database. This specialization allows the system to efficiently process queries with a high degree of accuracy and performance. For instance, the MySQL agent is specialized for relational data, making it well-suited for 10 handling queries involving structured databases with complex relationships. The Neo4j agent excels at handling graph data, efficiently managing relationships between entities in graph-based databases. Similarly, the MongoDB agent is optimized for document-oriented data, making it ideal for working with flexible, hierarchical data structures common in NoSQL systems. The system’s modular architecture ensures that agents can be added or updated without disrupting the overall function- ality. As new data types or sources emerge, new agents can be integrated to support these technologies. This flexibility is key to ensuring the system’s long-term scalability and adaptability. The functionfspecialization captures the relationship between the type of data, Ddata type, and the agent type, Aagent type, as follows: Sagent = fspecialization(Ddata type, Aagent type) This approach ensures that each agent is tailored for the specific requirements of the data it handles, allowing the system to deliver precise and optimized query results across a variety of data environments. 5.2 Architecture Diagram The architecture diagram illustrates the interconnected components of
