lead to better query generation and response synthesis. By leveraging advanced methods for prompt design, the system could minimize token overhead, reduce latency, and ensure responses are both precise and coherent.[17, 18] 9 Conclusion The proposed Multi-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system represents a significant advancement in leveraging generative AI for diverse and complex data environments. By introducing specialized agents tailored for different database types, a centralized query execution environment, and a generative agent for synthesizing responses, this framework addresses critical limitations of traditional single-agent RAG systems. It enhances query precision, optimizes token usage, and ensures scalability across heterogeneous data sources. The system’s modular architecture demonstrates adaptability across various industries, from healthcare to logistics, where seamless integration with relational, document-based, and graph databases is vital. Furthermore, the focus on error handling, efficient resource utilization, and reducing computational overhead establishes the proposed solution as robust and reliable for real-world applications. Looking ahead, this research lays the foundation for future advancements in multi-agent systems, including improved inter-agent collaboration, adaptive learning capabilities, and refined prompt engineering strategies. These innovations have the potential to further enhance the system’s efficiency and versatility, making it an indispensable tool for solving increasingly complex and data-intensive problems. This work not only bridges existing gaps in RAG methodologies but also opens new avenues for the thoughtful integration of AI into dynamic and diverse data ecosystems.
