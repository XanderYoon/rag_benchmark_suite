2: Literature Gap Analysis 3.4 Contribution Our work introduces a novel way to improve the accuracy, scalability, and efficiency of database interactions using a multi-agent system for retrieval-augmented generation. By addressing common challenges like token limitations, 7 diverse database types, and inefficient query handling, we aim to rethink how generative AI interacts with databases. Below are the key contributions of our approach: 3.4.1 Specialized Agents for Diverse Databases We designed specialized agents, such as the MySQL Agent, Neo4j Agent, and MongoDB Agent, tailored for specific database types. Each agent is optimized to interact seamlessly with its corresponding database, ensuring accurate queries and efficient data retrieval for relational, graph, and document-oriented systems. 3.4.2 Centralized Query Execution Our system simplifies query execution by combining outputs from different agents in a unified environment. This avoids redundant transformations and streamlines data retrieval across multiple database formats, ensuring that responses are both efficient and context-aware. 3.4.3 Collaborative Agent Workflows Each agent is tasked with specific roles, such as query generation, retrieval, or validation, depending on the database type. By allowing agents to focus on their strengths, we ensure that the generated results are precise and relevant. These outputs are then combined into a cohesive response, enhancing both retrieval quality and generative outputs. 3.4.4 Integrating Generative AI Thoughtfully The data retrieved by agents is synthesized into a coherent response using a central language model. By ensuring that only the most relevant and concise inputs are sent to the generative model, we improve the quality of outputs while reducing unnecessary or irrelevant information. 3.4.5 Synthesizing Data for Rich Responses Once data is retrieved, a generative component creates detailed and meaningful responses by merging information from multiple sources. This step ensures that user queries are addressed comprehensively, resulting in responses that are both logical and contextually rich. 3.4.6
