tables. For NoSQL databases such as MongoDB, there are MongoDB-specific drivers that handle document-based data, which can be more flexible and hierarchical. Similarly, graph databases like Neo4j require Neo4j drivers, which are specifically designed to query relationships between nodes in a graph structure. Depending on the type of database being queried, the correct driver is chosen to ensure smooth communication and efficient data retrieval. The query execution environment is responsible for managing the database connections, executing the queries generated by the agents, and retrieving the results. The execution function, gdb, handles the query Qgenerated and interacts with the target database Dconnection to return the results Rquery, which are then passed back to the system for further processing. This relationship is captured in the equation: Rquery = gdb(Qgenerated, Dconnection) By managing query execution in this way, the environment ensures that the system can efficiently retrieve data from various database types while maintaining consistency and accuracy across different data sources.[20] 5.1.3 Generative Agent The Generative Agent is responsible for synthesizing the final response to the user’s query based on the retrieved data. Once the query has been executed and the relevant data has been retrieved, the generative agent processes this information to create a coherent and contextually relevant response. This component serves as the "creative engine" of the system, transforming raw data into a format that is both understandable and useful for the user. The generative agent uses both the original user query, Quser, and the retrieved data, Rquery, to produce the final output, Aresponse. The response could take many forms, depending on the user’s request, such as structured text, tables, or graphs. The equation describing the relationship between the user query, the retrieved data, and the final response is: Aresponse = hgen(Quser, Rquery) This ensures that the response is not only
