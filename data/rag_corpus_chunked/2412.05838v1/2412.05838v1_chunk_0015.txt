to the generative agent, which synthesizes it into a coherent and contextually relevant response. The system’s modular approach enhances the overall query efficiency, reduces token overhead, and improves the accuracy of the final output, making it suitable for real-world applications that involve complex, multi-source data environments. Figure 1: Proposed Multi-Agent RAG System 5 Architecture Overview The proposed system introduces a modular and efficient architecture that leverages specialized agents to handle data retrieval and response generation. This architecture ensures seamless integration and processing across various data types and sources while maintaining scalability and adaptability. The key components of the architecture include query generation agents, the query execution environment, the generative agent, and agent specialization. These components work in harmony to achieve efficient query generation, execution, and synthesis of accurate responses. 5.1 Components of the Architecture 5.1.1 Query Generation Agents Query generation agents are essential to the proposed system, as they are responsible for generating executable queries that are tailored to the specific data sources. These agents operate independently, with each one specializing in handling a particular type of database. For example, the MySQL agent generates SQL queries optimized for relational databases, ensuring that the structure and relationships between tables are correctly represented. The MongoDB agent, on the other 9 hand, formulates queries suited for document-based NoSQL databases, focusing on handling nested and hierarchical data. Similarly, the Neo4j agent is specialized in generating Cypher queries, which are used for graph-based databases, enabling efficient querying of relationships between entities. Each agent utilizes the user’s query and the database schema to create the most effective query for that specific data source. This process is guided by a set of few-shot prompts [17] that provide the agent with relevant examples, ensuring that the query is syntactically correct and semantically meaningful.
