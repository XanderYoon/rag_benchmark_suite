retrieval. Algorithm 1 Query Generation Phase 1: Input: User query Q, Database schema S 2: DataSourceType ← identify_data_source(Q) 3: Assign Agent ← appropriate_query_generation_agent(DataSourceType) 4: if Agent is available then 5: GeneratedQuery ← Agent.generate_query(Q, S) 6: else 7: return No suitable agent found for query generation. 8: end if 9: Output: GeneratedQuery 7.2 Query Execution Once the query is generated, it is passed to the query execution environment. This environment interacts with the appro- priate database drivers to execute the query and retrieve the required data. By supporting polyglot environments[20], the query execution phase ensures compatibility with diverse database systems, ranging from relational databases to document stores and graph-based systems. Algorithm 2 Query Execution Phase 1: Input: GeneratedQuery, DataSourceType 2: DatabaseConnection ← connect_to_database(DataSourceType) 3: QueryResult ← DatabaseConnection.execute(GeneratedQuery) 4: Output: QueryResult 7.3 Response Generation The final phase combines the original user query and the retrieved data to generate a user-centric response. The generative agent synthesizes the retrieved context into a structured and meaningful output that aligns with the user’s requirements. The response can take various formats, such as plain text, tables, or visualizations like graphs, depending on the nature of the query. Algorithm 3 Response Generation Phase 1: Input: User query Q, QueryResult 2: Response ← GenerativeAgent.generate_answer(Q, QueryResult) 3: Output: Response 7.4 Integrated Methodology The overall methodology integrates the three phases into a cohesive process that transforms user queries into contextually accurate responses. The flow of the methodology ensures specialization, scalability, and efficiency, as shown in the pseudo code below. 13 Algorithm 4 Multi-Agent RAG System 1: Input: User query Q 2: DataSourceType ← identify_data_source(Q) 3: Agent ← appropriate_query_generation_agent(DataSourceType) 4: if Agent is available then 5: GeneratedQuery ← Agent.generate_query(Q, schema) 6: QueryResult ← execute_query(DataSourceType, GeneratedQuery) 7: Response ← GenerativeAgent.generate_answer(Q, QueryResult) 8: else 9: return No suitable agent found for query generation. 10:
