user’s query with relevant database schema details and a few-shot example set. These few-shot examples demonstrate the expected query formats and outputs, helping the system better interpret and process the user query in the context of the target database. The formation of this prompt ensures that the query is accurately tailored to the database’s structure and requirements. Once the prompt is prepared, the system identifies the most appropriate query generation agent based on the type of data source the user intends to query. These agents are specialized for specific database types, such as relational, document-based, or graph databases. The selected agent generates an optimized query that adheres to the database’s schema and fulfills the user’s requirements. This step ensures that the generated query is both syntactically correct and semantically aligned with the data source. The generated query is then executed within the query execution environment. This component of the system interacts with the appropriate database, ensuring seamless compatibility with diverse database systems. It retrieves the relevant data in response to the query, ensuring that the returned results are accurate and contextually appropriate. After retrieving the data, the system combines it with the original query context to prepare it for further processing. This integration step is critical as it provides the generative agent with the necessary information to produce an accurate and coherent response. The retrieved data and the original query context together serve as inputs for the generative phase. Finally, the generative agent synthesizes the final response. Leveraging the retrieved data and the user query, the agent produces a structured and contextually enriched output. The response is formatted according to the user’s requirements, which may include text summaries, graphs, tables, or detailed reports. This output is then presented to the user in an easily interpretable format, completing the workflow. Generativ
