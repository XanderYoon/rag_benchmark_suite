Ddata type, and the agent type, Aagent type, as follows: Sagent = fspecialization(Ddata type, Aagent type) This approach ensures that each agent is tailored for the specific requirements of the data it handles, allowing the system to deliver precise and optimized query results across a variety of data environments. 5.2 Architecture Diagram The architecture diagram illustrates the interconnected components of the system, showcasing how query generation agents, the query execution environment, and the generative agent work together to deliver accurate and contextually relevant responses. It highlights the modular nature of the system, emphasizing the role of each specialized agent in handling specific data types and the seamless integration of these components to achieve efficient query generation, execution, and response synthesis. Figure 2: Multi-Agent RAG System Architecture This architecture ensures that the proposed system remains efficient and scalable while adapting to diverse and complex data environments. Its modular design and specialized components offer a robust solution for addressing the challenges associated with managing heterogeneous data sources in a retrieval-augmented generation context. 11 6 System Workflow The system workflow begins with the submission of a natural language query by the user. This query acts as the input for the system and forms the basis for subsequent operations. The query, often posed in plain language, encapsulates the user’s request and is the starting point for the retrieval and response generation process. Following the query submission, the system generates a prompt by combining the user’s query with relevant database schema details and a few-shot example set. These few-shot examples demonstrate the expected query formats and outputs, helping the system better interpret and process the user query in the context of the target database. The formation of this prompt ensures that the query is accurately tailored to the database’s structure and requirements. Once the prompt
