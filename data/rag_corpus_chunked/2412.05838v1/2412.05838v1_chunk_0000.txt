While LLMs are highly capable, they often rely on static, pre-trained datasets, limiting their ability to integrate dynamic or private data. Traditional RAG systems typically use a single-agent architecture to handle query generation, data retrieval, and response synthesis. However, this approach becomes inefficient when dealing with diverse data sources, such as relational databases, document stores, and graph databases, often leading to performance bottlenecks and reduced accuracy. This paper proposes a Multi-Agent RAG system to address these limitations. Specialized agents, each optimized for a specific data source, handle query generation for relational, NoSQL, and document- based systems. These agents collaborate within a modular framework, with query execution delegated to an environment designed for compatibility across various database types. This distributed approach enhances query efficiency, reduces token overhead, and improves response accuracy by ensuring that each agent focuses on its specialized task. The proposed system is scalable and adaptable, making it ideal for generative AI workflows that require integration with diverse, dynamic, or private data sources. By leveraging specialized agents and a modular execution environment, the system provides an efficient and robust solution for handling complex, heterogeneous data environments in generative AI applications.
