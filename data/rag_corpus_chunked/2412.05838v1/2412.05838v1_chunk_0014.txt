By exploring agent specialization and synthesis, we provide a stepping stone for further advancements in this area. Through these contributions, we address the limitations of existing approaches and demonstrate how intelligent, specialized systems can enable more efficient and accurate interactions between generative AI and complex data environments. 4 Proposed System Overview The proposed Multi-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system utilizes a modular and scalable architecture to integrate multiple data sources with generative AI capabilities. Traditional single-agent RAG systems, while effective in simpler use cases, struggle with complex queries across various data environments. These systems typically rely on one entity that handles query generation, data retrieval, and response synthesis. This approach often results in inefficiencies when dealing with heterogeneous data sources such as relational, document-based, and graph-based data, leading to performance bottlenecks and inaccuracies in query processing. To address these challenges, the proposed system decentralizes task management by introducing specialized agents, each optimized for handling different types of data. For instance, the relational agent processes queries for relational data sources, while the graph agent manages graph data, the document agent works with document-based storage, and the text agent handles text-based data sources. These specialized agents collaborate within a centralized query execution environment, ensuring seamless compatibility across diverse data types. Once the relevant data is retrieved, it is passed to the generative agent, which synthesizes it into a coherent and contextually relevant response. The system’s modular approach enhances the overall query efficiency, reduces token overhead, and improves the accuracy of the final output, making it suitable for real-world applications that involve complex, multi-source data environments.
