(LLMs) to enhance 6G communication systems while addressing limitations in logic, data protection, and refinement. Three elements of a proposed multi-agent system improve LLMs: multi-agent evaluation and reflection (MER) to evaluate and improve results; multi-agent data retrieval 6 (MDR) to increase knowledge; and multi-agent collaborative planning (MCP) to provide solutions. This method demonstrates how multi-agent collaborations can enhance LLM performance for 6G tasks, validated through a case study on semantic communication [12]. Furthermore, the Extended Coevolutionary (EC) Theory combines coevolutionary dynamics, adaptive learning, and LLM-based strategy suggestions to overcome the shortcomings of conventional game theory in modeling dynamic Multi-Agent Systems (MASs). Unlike static models, this paradigm accounts for diverse interactions, including social relationships, financial transfers, and information exchange. Simulations validate the EC framework’s capacity to promote social welfare, strengthen resilience against shocks, and encourage cooperation in MASs. This method addresses existing issues in MASs and opens the door for further research in adaptive learning and strategic decision- making [13]. The potential of MASs to optimize complex tasks through cooperation is also discussed, emphasizing privacy protection and cooperative optimization, including distributed and federated approaches. The survey covers cooperative and non-cooperative games, analyzing individual cost reduction in non-cooperative settings and global cost minimization in cooperative ones. Future research prospects in cooperative optimization and game theory applications are highlighted [14]. 3.3 Literature Gap Discussion RAG systems have advanced significantly, but there are still issues with single-agent and multi-agent techniques requiring further research. Table 2 outlines key gaps in the current literature. Aspect Single-Agent RAG Multi-Agent RAG Token Efficiency Improved by frameworks like Speculative RAG but limited by response generation length and context capacity. Decentralization helps reduce token usage, but coordination across agents can increase token overhead. Contextual Handling Strong in evidence-based reasoning but struggles with dynamic context changes and context maintenance. Benefits from
