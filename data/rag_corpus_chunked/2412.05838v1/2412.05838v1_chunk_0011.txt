2 outlines key gaps in the current literature. Aspect Single-Agent RAG Multi-Agent RAG Token Efficiency Improved by frameworks like Speculative RAG but limited by response generation length and context capacity. Decentralization helps reduce token usage, but coordination across agents can increase token overhead. Contextual Handling Strong in evidence-based reasoning but struggles with dynamic context changes and context maintenance. Benefits from specialized agents managing different database types, but integration of diverse agents and data sources remains complex. Scalability Effective for focused, smaller tasks but not well-suited for large-scale database integra- tion. Enhanced by distributing tasks, but manag- ing complex interactions and synchroniza- tion between agents is challenging. Knowledge Access Leverages pre-trained and non-parametric memory for improved accuracy but has lim- itations in real-time knowledge updating. Multi-agent collaboration helps with knowl- edge expansion and validation, yet adapting agents to new or changing data types is an open issue. Diversity in Data Sources Primarily uses indexed data like Wikipedia and suffers when addressing varied, hetero- geneous databases. Can include different database types but maintaining coherence and uniformity across data sources is difficult. Coordination and Communication Typically involves a single-agent model, limiting interaction complexity. Multi-agent approaches offer improved han- dling but require intricate communication strategies, leading to potential inefficien- cies. Application Versatility Effective for specific, narrow tasks but less versatile for complex or varied applications. Versatile across different database environ- ments, but adapting multi-agent interactions for consistent performance across domains needs more research. Table 2: Literature Gap Analysis 3.4 Contribution Our work introduces a novel way to improve the accuracy, scalability, and efficiency of database interactions using a multi-agent system for retrieval-augmented generation. By addressing common challenges like token limitations, 7 diverse database types, and inefficient query handling, we aim to rethink how generative AI interacts with databases.
