Local models are better suited for scenarios where data privacy and control are paramount, while API-based models excel in environments that demand scalability and ease of integration. Hybrid approaches that combine local processing for sensitive data with cloud-based solutions for less critical tasks represent a promising direction for future advancements. Such system could offer the best of both worlds, enabling organizations to achieve a balance between privacy, performance, and cost-effectiveness in RAG systems. 2.4 Prompt Engineering for Multi-Agent RAG Systems Prompt engineering is a crucial aspect of the Multi-Agent RAG System, as it directly influences the quality and accuracy of the generated queries [16, 17, 18]. Few-shot prompting is particularly effective in this context, as it provides the agent with examples of how to interact with a specific database schema. A well-designed prompt includes the user’s query, the database schema, and a few-shot example illustrating how similar queries have been constructed.[17] 3 Few-shot prompts are carefully crafted to minimize errors and optimize token usage. For example, a MongoDB agent tasked with retrieving research papers might be given a schema detailing the structure of the database and examples of how to construct queries for different use cases. This targeted approach ensures that agents generate accurate and efficient queries tailored to their specific data domains. ElasticSearch Agent Few-Shot Prompt: Schema Overview: { "index": "SupportTickets", "fields": { "ticket_id": "string", "description": "string", "raised_by": "string", "status": "string" } } Example 1: Question: Find support tickets related to MySQL issues raised by Sayali Shivpuje. Expected Query: { "query": { "bool": { "must": [ { "match": { "description": "MySQL" }}, { "match": { "raised_by": "Sayali Shivpuje" }} ] }
