Confidence is calculated by the average value over the lowest logit of each generation. domain augmentation frequency, we conclude that RAGate-MHA can outperform RAGate-MHA and effectively capture the trend of augmentation needs. 5.3 RAGate for Response Generation To evaluate the effect of adaptive RAG for a conver- sational system, we use RAGate-PEFT (contx-(syn- resp)-ner) with the highest precision and RAGate- MHA (MHA(contx)) with the best overall perfor- mance in the above analysis, to support the adaptive retrieval augmented conversational response gen- eration. Table 3 presents the results of applying RAGAte to the KETOD model for adaptive knowl- edge augmentation when evaluated on the KETOD dataset. We include four types of adaptive augmen- tation, namely the use of RAGate and comparison to the random selection with equal numbers of se- lections, human choice, and the commonly used "all"
