to im- prove the performance of Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) systems by using a dual-feedback mecha- nism. The retriever identifies relevant knowledge from a database, while the generator uses this in- formation to create appropriate system responses. The feedback from the generator is further used as pseudo-labels to train the retriever to select perti- nent information. Shen et al. (2023) introduced a training method based on maximal marginal like- lihood. This method jointly optimise a perceptive retriever and the response generation in a feed- back loop.

Kang et al. (2023) further advance the retriever by proposing SUbgraph Retrieval-augmented GEn- eration (SURGE), which employed a graph neural network (GNN)-based context-relevant subgraph retriever. SURGE incorporates contrastive learn- ing to optimise the latent representation space, en- suring that generated texts closely resemble the retrieved subgraphs. Despite the richness of existing retrieval- augmented generation techniques for conversa- tional systems, they commonly hypothesise that every conversation turn needs external knowledge. However, the necessity of augmenting every turn of the conversation with external knowledge re- mains questionable. A relevant thread of work that aims to answer this question is the introduction of the knowledge-seeking turn detection task using the DSTC-9 dataset (Kim et al., 2020), and the follow-up studies, such as (Hong et al., 2023; Jin et al., 2021). However, this task is to identify the turns in
