of the conversation with external knowledge re- mains questionable. A relevant thread of work that aims to answer this question is the introduction of the knowledge-seeking turn detection task using the DSTC-9 dataset (Kim et al., 2020), and the follow-up studies, such as (Hong et al., 2023; Jin et al., 2021). However, this task is to identify the turns in conversations injected by human workers about knowledge enquiry instead of identifying the system responses that require knowledge augmen- tation for improvements. This research gap high- lights the value and novelty of this study, which investigates the adaptive use of retrieval-augmented generation for advanced conversational systems. 3 Methodology 3.1 Problem Formulation This study addresses the challenge of effectively identifying conversation turns that require augmen- tation of external knowledge. In particular, we aim to develop a gate mechanism that dynamically de- termines when to search for external knowledge to ensure natural, relevant and contextually appro- priate responses. First, we define the task of user- system conversation. Let D = {d1, d2, ..., d|D|} be a set of user-system dialogues, and each dialogue d comprises a sequence of interactions between users and systems (i.e., d = {u0, s0, u1, s1, ..., uT , sT }) with varying lengths. Here, ut and st denote the user utterance and system response at the t-th turn, respectively. The conversational context up to turn t can be formulated by aggregating the previous user-system interactions, i.e., ct = u0, s0, .., ut. With this context information ct, the conversation system can augment it with a list of retrieved exter- nal knowledge, et,k, where k represents the rank- ing cutoff for the retrieved knowledge. Hence, the binary gate mechanism proposed in this study, de- ciding the knowledge augmentation, can be formu- lated as f(ct) = {0, 1} or f(ct,
