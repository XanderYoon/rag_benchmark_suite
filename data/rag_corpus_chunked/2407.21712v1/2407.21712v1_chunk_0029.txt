### Example 1: USER: I’m planning a trip, can you help me look for a flight? SYSTEM: Which day are you planning to return and from which city? USER: I want to go from NYC the day after tomorrow and return on the 13th of this month. SYSTEM: Where would you like to go? USER: I want to go to Vancouver, BC. Can you look for a Premium Economy class ticket. SYSTEM: I found 1 flight for you. It is a Delta Airlines flight that takes off at 6 am and returns at 2:50 am. The price is $505. USER: What is the departure airport, and how many stops does the flight have? ### Response: True ### Example 2: USER: Get me bus tickets to a Cher event on March 6th. SYSTEM: How many to buy? USER: only one, please. ### Response: False ### Input: [Converstion Context Input] ### Response: B Impact of Retrieval Quality on Adaptive RAG To have a successful conversation model with a retrieval-augmented system, two main criteria must be met. One is identifying insufficient context, and the other is the quality of retrieved information (Salemi and Zamani, 2024; Yu et al., 2024). A conversational model performs better when both criteria are satisfied. In our proposed approach, as shown in Table 2, we have already assessed whether our adaptive retrieval method can detect insufficient context. We further explored to deter- mine whether our model can inherently estimate the quality of the retrieved snippets to address such insufficiency and, based on that, decide on the re- trieval. Although we do not explicitly provide re- trieved snippets to our model, retrieval comes with a corpus that includes potentially relevant knowl- edge snippets. Consequently, given a query and a retrieval collection, it can be estimated whether useful information for the
