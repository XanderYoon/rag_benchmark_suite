the input. A leader agent coordinates their outputs and synthesizes the final answer. Building on the idea of agent specialization, Zhu et al. [28] proposed ATM, a dual-agent adversarial RAG framework consisting of a generator and an attacker. The attacker injects chal- lenging distractor documents, forcing the generator to distinguish relevant information even in misleading contexts through adver- sarial training. Expanding the agent interaction paradigm, Yang et al. [25] introduced IM-RAG, which models an “inner monologue” among a reasoner, retriever, and refiner. These agents engage in iterative communication to refine both the queries and the retrieved content before generating a final answer. Further emphasizing task specialization, Jang and Li [11] developed AU-RAG, where distinct agents are dedicated to sub-tasks such as query understanding, document retrieval, and answer generation. Similarly, AgentFusion by Saeid and Kopinski [20] assigns specific roles such as planning, verification, and refinement to multiple agents within the genera- tion pipeline, thereby enabling a more modular and robust genera- tion process. Chang et al. [2] proposed MAIN-RAG, a training-free, multi-agent architecture that focuses explicitly on document fil- tering and evidence scoring. This approach significantly improves answer accuracy while mitigating the impact of noisy retrievals. Our proposed framework, RAGentA, builds directly on the insights from MAIN-RAG, aiming to further enhance retrieval robustness and by providing attribution to sources used for text generation. Attributed Text Generation. Also known as citation genera- tion, this task aims to produce text with explicit citations to source documents, thereby enhancing trustworthiness. As described by Huang and Chang [9], LLM attribution is broadly categorized into parametric and non-parametric approaches. Parametric approaches, such as Galactica [22], generate citations only using the model’s in- ternal knowledge. In contrast, non-parametric methods leverage ex- ternal knowledge sources during generation to provide attribution. Non-parametric approaches can be divided into post-generation and
