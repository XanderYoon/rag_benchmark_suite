Never- theless, LLMs often generate hallucinations, meaning factually in- correct or misleading outputs [10]. Because users currently have limited means to verify LLM-generated answers, hallucinated in- formation becomes especially problematic. This lack of verifiability poses a significant challenge for deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains such as science, healthcare, and law, where factuality and trust are essential. RAG addresses this issue by combining traditional information retrieval with LLMs [12]. Relevant documents are retrieved from external sources and used to guide the model’s generation. This approach reduces the likelihood of unsupported claims by ground- ing answers in curated, up-to-date information. Building on this foundation, Gao et al. [7] show that RAG can also enable attribution, for example via in-line citations. This allows users to verify the sources of generated content and increases trustworthiness. As part of our participation in the SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG Challenge, we propose a multi-agent RAG framework for attributed QA that emphasizes both answer correctness and faithfulness. We extend the MAIN-RAG framework [ 2], which employs three agents to score the relevance of retrieved documents for improved answer correctness. We enhance this architecture by introducing a novel agent that improves the faithfulness of the output through fine- grained attribution and
