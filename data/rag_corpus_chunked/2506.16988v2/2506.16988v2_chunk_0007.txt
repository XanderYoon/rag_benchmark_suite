Architecture of the RAGentA framework: (1) A hybrid retriever selects top-20 documents. (2) Agent-1 generates an initial answer. (3) Agent-2 filters Query-Document-Answer triplets. (4) Agent-3 produces a final answer with in-line citations. (5) Agent-4 checks completeness, optionally reformulates the query, and merges both answers. 4.2 Multi-Agent Architecture Our multi-agent architecture builds up on the MAIN-RAG frame- work [2], which employs a multi-agent system for document fil- tering and answer generation. In RAGentA, we preserve the core architecture of MAIN-RAG while introducing two key advance- ments: a substantial modification to Agent 3 and the addition of a novel Agent 4 dedicated to answer verification. Specifically, Agent 3 has been fundamentally redesigned to generate fine-grained in-line citations, thereby attributing each statement in the answer to its supporting evidence. In the following, we describe the roles and interactions of the four agents within the RAGentA framework. 4.2.1 Agent-1: Predictor. Following document retrieval, Agent-1 generates query-specific answers for each retrieved document, forming Query-Document-Answer triplets. This agent employs an LLM to analyze each document in the context of the given query and generates an answer based on its content. 4.2.2 Agent-2: Judge. This agent evaluates each document’s rele- vance by determining its utility in addressing the query. For each triplet, Agent-2 addresses the question: “Is this document relevant and supportive for answering the question?” generating a binary “Yes” or “No” assessment. We implement adaptive document filter- ing by calculating a relevance score derived from the difference be- tween logarithmic probabilities: score = log 𝑝 (“Yes”) − log 𝑝 (“No”). After scoring all documents, the system computes the mean score (𝜏𝑞) and standard deviation (𝜎), establishing a dynamic threshold as adjusted_𝜏𝑞 = 𝜏𝑞 − 𝑛 ·𝜎, where 𝑛 is a hyperparameter control- ling filtering stringency. According to empirical analyses from the MAIN-RAG study, optimal performance is
