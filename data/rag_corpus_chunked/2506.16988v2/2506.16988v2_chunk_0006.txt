based on BM25, is a widely adopted model that relies on exact term match- ing [18, 19]. Our semantic retrieval is powered by dense embeddings using the intfloat/e5-base-v2 model (E5) with Pinecone as the vector store to capture nuanced semantic relationships [23]. These two systems are fused using a tunable interpolation pa- rameter 𝛼 ∈ [ 0, 1], producing a final document score as: 𝑆hybrid (𝑑) = 𝛼 ·𝑆sparse (𝑑) + ( 1 − 𝛼) · 𝑆dense (𝑑) (1) We set 𝛼 = 0.35 to give slightly higher weight to dense retrieval while maintaining meaningful contribution from sparse retrieval. This choice is motivated by the prior findings of Mosquera et al . [13], where a hybrid retrieval with 𝛼 = 0.35 yielded the best perfor- mance. Their experiments on regulatory texts demonstrated that this balance improves overall retrieval performance.

Query-Document- Answer Triplet Q1-D3-A3 Completeness Check Figure 1: Architecture of the RAGentA framework: (1) A hybrid retriever selects top-20 documents. (2) Agent-1 generates an initial answer. (3) Agent-2 filters Query-Document-Answer triplets. (4) Agent-3 produces a final answer with in-line citations. (5) Agent-4 checks completeness, optionally reformulates the query, and merges both answers. 4.2 Multi-Agent Architecture Our multi-agent architecture builds up on the MAIN-RAG frame- work [2], which employs
