of the meaning of user queries, ii) by exploiting the semantic meaning of document words while being less sensitive to noisy words in the document transcripts and iii) by creating opportunities for the system to understand the learner interactions more meaningfully. RQ1 Do Wikipedia concepts carry a signal that indicates relevance of documents to queries? RQ2 Can Wikipedia annotations improve noisy information retrieval? Through this work, we conduct a few preliminary experiments to validate these research questions. We choose the segment retrieval task from the Podcast Track at TREC 2020 [ 12] for these experiments as ”search” is a key component of proactive information retrieval. We use this task specifically as the query description is provided as part of the query, providing the context of the query. In many proactive IR systems, the query context is mined using the user interaction history. In this case, the description can be treated as a context representation mined from the users’ prior interactions. 3.1. Information Retrieval Models We restrict our model choices to a probabilistic retrieval method BM25 and a hypergeometric weighing model DPH. The reasons for restricting to probabilistic models are i) its superior performance in noisy IR [9], ii) the simplicity to introducing Wikipedia concept features, iii) the data and computational efficiency in training models and iv) the practical feasibility to real world systems. The models we utilise in this these experiments use the query 𝑞, query description 𝑑 and the segment 𝑠. 3.1.1. Baseline Models We use BM25 and DPH models as probabilistic baseline models for this work. These two models use the textual tokens of the query 𝑞 and the segment 𝑠 to compute the relevance score 𝑟𝑒𝑙 as per equation 1 where txt identifies the text token features.. 𝑟𝑒𝑙(𝑞, 𝑠) = 𝑓 (𝑞txt, 𝑠txt) (1) As described in
