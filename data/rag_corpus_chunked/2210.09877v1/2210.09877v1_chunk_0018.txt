ran a series of experiments. Our first experiment showed that the overlap of Wikipedia concepts between the relevant segments and the query are significantly larger than with the non-relevant segments. A subsequent experiment that added Wikipedia concept features to the search query and the document showed that the relevance model that uses Wikipedia concepts can improve precision of the ranking model while retaining the NDCG score in comparison to a counterpart that uses entities instead of Wikipedia concepts. A deeper analysis on the Wikification of the queries also showed that the meaning of the query keywords can be enhanced by using the query context. We also demonstrated using two recent works on how Wikipedia taxonomy can help an IR system to better connect with the end user and enable them to carry out structured IR tasks by proactively helping them navigate the information in the result sets. It is seen that having Wikipedia concepts allows presenting the result set in a humanly intuitive form that encourages the user to efficiently refine their query in the subsequent steps. All the observations from the analysed systems indicate that Wikipedia concepts have a key role to play in creating proactive information retrieval systems that can facilitate a higher degree human-in-the-loop operation. In the future work, we aim to use more sophisticated representations of Wikipedia concepts and advanced relevance models to run large scale experiments on the full podcast dataset with 3.5 Mn segments. Understanding how to use Wikipedia concepts effectively (e.g. by ranking them) is a top priority.
