be summarised using the entities and concepts in the document. As shown in the demonstration, the detected entities and concepts allow the user to understand the contents of the relevant documents quickly. Their user study also found that the users didn’t utilise the statements and summaries as much as they used the concepts and entities [29]. However, this system lacks the capabilities of explaining the topics as it is not backed by a knowledge base pointing to the advantages of using a taxonomy that has auxiliary information that can be used. In a nutshell, many recent visualisation approaches use concepts to represent documents. Having Wikipedia as a topic taxonomy enables these systems to make use of the advancements of Wikification that is advancing rapidly at present. It also allows taking use of other information in Wikipedia (e.g. semantic relatedness between topics, hierarchy of concepts etc.) to model the concepts in a much more sophisticated manner. This in turn, helps bridging the system seamlessly to the end user, creating cleaner interaction footprints that transform into the input for proactive search. 6. Conclusion Through this work, we explore the potential of using Wikipedia concepts to drive the proactive search experience of an IR system working on noisy documents. We explored the usefulness of Wikipedia concepts focusing on 2 research questions. We treated the query description in a podcast segment retrieval task dataset as the user context in a proactive IR system and ran a series of experiments. Our first experiment showed that the overlap of Wikipedia concepts between the relevant segments and the query are significantly larger than with the non-relevant segments. A subsequent experiment that added Wikipedia concept features to the search query and the document showed that the relevance model that uses Wikipedia concepts can improve precision of the ranking
