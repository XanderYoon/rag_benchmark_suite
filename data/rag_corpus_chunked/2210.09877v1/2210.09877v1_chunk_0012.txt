and known item (”story about riding a bird” is ignored as it is a query that belongs to the refinding category). We enrich these queries using Wikification in two settings, i) query only vs. ii) query + description, to investigate if the identified Wiki concepts are different. Table 3 reports how the salient entities in the query keywords are detected differently in the two settings. Figure 1: Jaccard similarity distribution of relevant vs. non-relevant segments for each query in the podcast dataset.

Discussion The results obtained in the preliminary experiments conducted are very promising. Majority of the results suggest that Wikipedia concepts can help the IR system. 5.1. The Usefulness of Wikipedia Features (RQ1) Figure 1 clearly shows that the Jaccard similarity coefficient between the relevant segments 𝜌rel and the non-relevant documents 𝜌non rel are different from each other. It is even evident that the confidence intervals don’t even overlap in some of the queries in the training data. The test statistics presented in table 1 further confirms this observation. In a one-tailed hypothesis test, all the queries demonstrate statistically significant differences of medians where the median Jaccard similarity of the Wikipedia concepts of the relevant segments and the query
