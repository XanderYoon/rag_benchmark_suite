Wikipedia concepts to represent documents can support proactive information retrieval by summarising the key concepts/entities in the result collection, helping the user to make more informed decisions on their next steps. important to retain the NDCG gains found in the DCU model. In this scenario, we use the Wikipedia concepts and entities extracted from the description to improve the search ranking. While we treat the description in this scenario as a representation extracted from the user history, many concept-based user models described in section 2 support extracting features such as keywords [21] and Wikipedia concepts [1] from content. Query Keyword Disambiguation The results in table 3 also give us insights into the po- tential of using query context for keyword disambiguation. It is seen that in multiple queries, certain concepts were not even detected when the query was used exclusively for Wikificaiton (e.g. Greta Thunberg, Michelle Obama etc.). However, with the presence of context (that can be extracted from historic encounter of concepts of a user [4]), the algorithm managed to identify these concepts in the query increasing recall. Table 3 also shows instances where the precision of identification is improved in the presence of the context. The more precise Novel Coronavirus was detected in the first query while the system understood that the query was about Michelle Obama’s book,Becoming in the fifth query, not the philosophical concept. These results show how many scenarios where short query keywords can be clarified automatically by referring to the context rather than needlessly prompting the human user. 5.3. Wikipedia Concepts and the User Experience The previous section discussed one opportunity of Wikification, automatic query word disam- biguation. Such features will substantially decrease the number of user prompts in a system leading to a smoother experience. Wikipedia concepts also bring the advantage of being
