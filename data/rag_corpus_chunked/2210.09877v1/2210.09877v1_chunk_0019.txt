Understanding how to use Wikipedia concepts effectively (e.g. by ranking them) is a top priority. Acknowledgments This research was partially conducted as part of the X5GON project funded from the EU’s Horizon 2020 research programme grant No 761758. This work is also supported by the European Commission-funded project “Humane AI: Toward AI Systems That Augment and Empower Humans by Understanding Us, our Society and the World Around Us” (grant 820437), EU Erasmus+ project ”European Network for Catalysing Open Resources in Education” (project ref: 621586-EPP-1-2020-1-NO-EPPKA2-KA), and the AT2030 Programme. The AT2030 programme is funded by aid from the UK government and led by the Global Disability Innovation Hub. References [1] S. Bulathwela, M. Pérez-Ortiz, E. Yilmaz, J.
