users to use IR systems more effectively. However, a key part of facilitating information retrieval tasks proactively is building systems that can capture the relevant signal from the user that indicate the informational needs of them. Prior works in this domain have identified several ways to harvest user intent. The simplest approach in this direction is to explicitly ask questions [17] or use the demographic information of the user [18] to profile them. Rather than explicitly disrupting the user experience, many works harvest implicit user actions such as clicks, impressions and previous searches [19, 18]. Especially in the social media domain, the interactions of users are used to create concept-based models [20] that can be used to infer user preferences and create zero effort queries for new content. The extracted preference features are usually used to expand information queries [8, 7], synthesise zero-effort queries [ 20] or personalise search results [ 21]. In this work, we argue in support of using concept-based user models as a form of zero-effort query for informational recommendation and learning scenarios, especially in the presence of noisy document representations. 2.1. Concept-based User Modelling and Wikipedia In the field of document retrieval and personalisation, keyword extraction is a heavily used form of identifying concepts from textual documents. When working with short text such as social media posts, the common method is to use the words in the posts as words and build a user profile over these words [22]. While this approach provides fine grained features, the feature space can be too vast and pose challenges in increasing recall. To address this issue, other systems use topic detection using unsupervised learning approaches such as LDA [23]. Such unsupervised techniques are complex to tune and are not guaranteed to give humanly intuitive topics. While expert annotation (e.g.
