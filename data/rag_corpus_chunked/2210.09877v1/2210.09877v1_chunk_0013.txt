is even evident that the confidence intervals don’t even overlap in some of the queries in the training data. The test statistics presented in table 1 further confirms this observation. In a one-tailed hypothesis test, all the queries demonstrate statistically significant differences of medians where the median Jaccard similarity of the Wikipedia concepts of the relevant segments and the query is greater than that of the non-relevant segments. These results enable us to conclude that the the overlap of Wikipedia concepts between queries and relevant documents is an influential signal that can be incorporated in relevance computation. The results indicate that there is promise in using Table 2 Ranking performance of the models. The best performance in bold and the second best in italic face.

Utility of Wikification in Information Retrieval (RQ2) The usefulness of Wikipedia concepts in relevance prediction is validated in the results presented in table 2. The results in the table show that replacing the NER-based entities with Wikipedia concepts is not as fruitful as augmenting them while
