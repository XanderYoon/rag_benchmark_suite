wiki/Stock Wikipedia concepts as a feature in IR systems where noise is present. 5.2. Utility of Wikification in Information Retrieval (RQ2) The usefulness of Wikipedia concepts in relevance prediction is validated in the results presented in table 2. The results in the table show that replacing the NER-based entities with Wikipedia concepts is not as fruitful as augmenting them while the entities are retained. It is observed that both the proposed models outperform the entity based DCU model in precision at 10. This aligns with the our understanding of the effect of Wikipedia concepts. NER, while detecting specific persons, organisations and other entities in the text, only adds the textual representations of these entities to the query to expand it. Therefore, the newly added queries are not capable of entity disambiguation (when the same term occurs in a segment meaning something else. e.g. Apple, the fruit vs. the company) and coreference resolution (when a different textual form is used to mean the same entity. e.g. United Nations vs. UN). On the contrary, enriching both the query and the document with Wikipedia entities enable accounting for both of these effects, making the relevance calculation more precise. The Ent_Wiki_rel model that contains both the NER-based entities and Wikipedia concepts, manages to improve the precision at 10 while retaining the NDCG performance. This shows that keeping the entities in the query is Figure 2: (i) X5Learn [28] and IFacetSum [29] showing that using Wikipedia concepts to represent documents can support proactive information retrieval by summarising the key concepts/entities in the result collection, helping the user to make more informed decisions on their next steps. important to retain the NDCG gains found in the DCU model. In this scenario, we use the Wikipedia concepts and entities extracted from the description to improve the search
