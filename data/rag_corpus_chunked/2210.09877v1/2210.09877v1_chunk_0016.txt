clarified automatically by referring to the context rather than needlessly prompting the human user. 5.3. Wikipedia Concepts and the User Experience The previous section discussed one opportunity of Wikification, automatic query word disam- biguation. Such features will substantially decrease the number of user prompts in a system leading to a smoother experience. Wikipedia concepts also bring the advantage of being grounded in a taxonomy that is intuitive to humans. The human intuitive nature of Wikipedia concepts allows the system to provide more transparent result sets that the user can navigate more efficiently. Figure 2 shows two recent systems demonstrating the potential of using Wikipedia based representations to improve human-in-the-loop information retrieval. The left system, X5Learn [28] shows how different Wikipedia concepts are related to different segments of videos. The Jaccard-based relevance can be used to visualise the degree of concept overlap between the segments and the query indicating relevance (connecting to the hypothesis of RQ1). Also, using Wikipedia concepts rather than free-form keywords or NER-based entities allows the system to provide explanations of the concepts users encounter. This can be done using the knowledge base behind the taxonomy (in this case, Wikipedia as per figure 2 (left)) Many users seeking information do not fully understand the knowledge landscape they navigate and can use learning opportunities to get more familiar with the topics. IFacetSum, a multi-faceted mix-initiative interface shown in figure 2(right) is an example of how the result sets can be summarised using the entities and concepts in the document. As shown in the demonstration, the detected entities and concepts allow the user to understand the contents of the relevant documents quickly. Their user study also found that the users didn’t utilise the statements and summaries as much as they used the concepts and entities [29]. However, this system lacks
