Library data. Additionally, adding the most popular queries searched by the users over time and generation of related articles, magazines, as well as books concerning the book clicked by users are the few features that can be added over the top of the currently existing OCR Search Engine developed at CVIT, to make it more accessible and handy during usage. 4.1. Conclusion The end goal is to develop and deploy an enhanced Indic IRE system that can exploit the large corpora provided by the NDLI, and the output generated by the Indic OCR grew at CVIT. This system will improve the user search experi- ence for the Indic languages and increase the popularity of reading digitized books amongst the general populace. This system is currently being developed by adding more func- tionalities and newer languages like Bangla and Sanskrit. References [1] James Allan, J. Aslam, Nicholas Belkin, Chris Buckley, J.
