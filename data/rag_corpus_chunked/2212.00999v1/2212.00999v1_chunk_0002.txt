Indian IRE systems Modern state-of-the-art IRE systems suffer from vari- ous challenges for Indian data. These challenges can vary among different areas within information retrieval. These areas majorly include cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) [10], Web search, user modeling, ﬁltering, classiﬁ- cation, summarization, question answering, metasearch, se- mantic, and context-based search and extraction [1]. Based on the current trends and research work, these are some of the challenges that the community faces at the moment: 2.1. Limited Research Aid According to the latest Indian Census, India has 24 of- ﬁcially recorded languages. These include Hindi and En- glish. Although most of these languages have a similar grammatical structure and layout, the semantics and script differ drastically between them. Furthermore, a particular language varies widely in fonts, rendering schemes, dialects and other aspects depending on the region. 1 arXiv:2212.00999v1 [cs.IR] 2 Dec 2022 Moreover, the number of researchers contributing in the ﬁeld of information retrieval and text-based challenges for Indian languages (Hindi, Bangla, Sanskrit, Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam) are comparatively smaller due to the diver- sity in them, as well as due to the involvement of various modalities for instance images, text or audio. 2.2. Limited amount of available data One of the reasons for the lack of research in building quality IRE systems for Indian languages is the lack of data for information retrieval. Even when the data is publicly available, it is not readily usable and requires extensive cleaning and preprocessing to make it suitable for the re- trieval models. Current state-of-the-art methods like Word- Net [13], ConceptNet [18] are trained on large datasets for Roman and Latin scripts. Similar datasets are tedious to build due to the reasons stated in 2.1. Thus, the unavailabil- ity of quality data for this task hinders the progress in the ﬁeld. Recently, several
