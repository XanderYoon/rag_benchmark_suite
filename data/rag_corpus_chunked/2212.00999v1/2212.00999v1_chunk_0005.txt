for such languages. Unavailability of IRE algorithms and dic- tionaries in Indic languages that can fetch similar words due to differences in the script and colossal amount of data to a given query hampers the search engine’s performance. The developed OCR Search Engine that demonstrates the accu- racy of the multilingual Indic OCR along with the retrieval accuracy. This OCR Search Engine is an IRE system that uses Op- tical Character Recognition designed for Indian scripts to generate the text from the document images in the Indic languages. Currently, it supports Hindi, Tamil, and Telugu languages. The system is built using Python and PSQL, forming the back-end and HTML/CSS being used as the front end. It uses the text generated by the Indic OCR developed at IIIT Hyderabad, line-level segmentation, and document im- ages to form the database of the system. The database is indexed using Elasticsearch, which is an open-source dis- tributed Java package. 2 Figure 2: Basic pipeline followed by the OCR Search En- gine 3.1. Functionalities The IRE system designed by us performs retrieval tasks on multiple levels : • Query Level Search The task is performed by entering the keyword/text in the search bar. There are multiple levels within the query level search like: – Single Query Search: Search based on one key- word search – Multiple Query Search: Search based on more than one keywords – Exact Query Search : Search based on retrieving exact entered query (by using double quotes) – Query Processing: Removal of stopwords and implementation of tokenization and stemming. • Relevance and Visualization – Relevance: Based on the number of occurrence of a particular keyword in the database and num- ber of hits for a particular book from users. – Visualization: Highlighted query outputs within the resulting books using segmentation method.
