Understanding the rich semantic and context behind a text query is extremely important for the search engines to return relevant results. For instance, in the search engines Yahoo and Bing, if a per- son enters a search query ’Nokia’, the results generated will be all the links containing Nokia, irrespective of their us- ability for the user. Whereas in Google search, the links are ranked in order of details about Nokia and currently avail- able cellphones of Nokia showing a higher semantic under- standing of the Google search engine than that of Yahoo and Bing. Similar features are needed to be implemented for the Indian language based IRE system. However, due to the complexity of Indian languages, newer techniques speciﬁcally designed for them are re- quired for generating rich semantic embedding. Hence, building algorithms that can extract rich information from Indic texts and later combine them with user search history and search patterns can be beneﬁcial. 3. What is OCR Search Engine? In recent years, there has been a lot of research in the ﬁeld of text recognition, and efforts have been put into achieve an OCR that can perform well on Indian scripts. In- dic scripts pose unique challenges for state-of-the-art OCR algorithms trained in English. For example, Sandhi rules and the difference in glyphs make it harder for the state-of- the-art OCR algorithms to work for such languages. makes it harder for the State-of-the-art OCR algorithms to work for such languages. Unavailability of IRE algorithms and dic- tionaries in Indic languages that can fetch similar words due to differences in the script and colossal amount of data to a given query hampers the search engine’s performance. The developed OCR Search Engine that demonstrates the accu- racy of the multilingual Indic OCR along with the retrieval accuracy. This OCR
