to the query searched), the highlighted queries, meta details, and the complete book(s). The download op- tions are currently unavailable. The users do not need to log in to use the system, and this makes the search and the generated results accessible for everyone to view and read. 4. Future Work These are the few proposed ideas that can be imple- mented over the top of the existing system that has been built and discussed here. 4.0.1 Abstract Generation Abstracts are necessary when a user cannot dedicate his time reading the complete book. It allows a user to un- derstand the summary of the book, thus enable a user to ﬁlter out books of his/her interest. This becomes more rele- vant in the case of Indic languages where there are religious 4 texts in different languages; for instance, it might be the case that the user would not want to read the entire drama book in Hindi but the gist of a particular page. State-of-the- art attention-based models [19, 20, 23] can be used to gen- erate a ﬂuent, concise, and understandable summary of the complete book. This can even be used to create summaries of chapters or pages within the book, which will make the user experience more smooth and increase the system’s us- age. Relevant keywords, frequency within the document, and readability will contribute to the abstract generation. This feature can further be enhanced by adding an audio option, i.e., Text-To-Speech (TTS), which will recite the ab- stract of the book to the user. 4.0.2 Semantic and Context Based IRE Usually, the searched queries are short or lack of intent be- hind the search. These queries might generate ambiguous results that the users do not expect. The current system de- signs fetch results using text processing techniques like
