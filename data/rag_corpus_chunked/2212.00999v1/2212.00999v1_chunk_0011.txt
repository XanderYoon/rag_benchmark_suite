OpenCyc [12] and ConceptNet [9] can be used to achieve some results in the case of Indic languages. Additionally, the search results in the current system can be improved by using Query Expansion(QE) [2] [3]. QE is performed by broadening the query by introducing additional keywords within the originally entered query. These usually include abbreviations, synonyms, antonyms, hyponyms, and hypernyms. Unsupervised or Supervised methods can be used to achieve this. Doc2Vec and Word2Vec can be used to capture the surface and seman- tic level similarity and perform Query Expansion. 4.0.3 System Based Multiple features can be added to the system to enhance it. Machine Translation(MT) [5, 7, 14, 15, 22] is one of the features that can be added. A user can type the query in one language and retrieve the results based on the meaning of that query in another language. For example, ”Mahabharat” searched in ”Hindi” should fetch ”Mahabharatha” results from the languages Tamil and Telugu too. Image and Audio based search methods can also be added where the entered query can either be audio or im- age. The audio search method is Speech to Text conver- sion, where a user can speak, and the query will automati- cally be translated and entered into the search bar. Image- based/Document Information Retrieval [16, 21] is another search method that can be implemented. In this work [6] by VGG group, the retrieval is performed over the object category on British Library data. Additionally, adding the most popular queries searched by the users over time and generation of related articles, magazines, as well as books concerning the book clicked by users are the few features that can be added over the top of the currently existing OCR Search Engine developed at CVIT, to make it more accessible and handy during usage.
