option, i.e., Text-To-Speech (TTS), which will recite the ab- stract of the book to the user. 4.0.2 Semantic and Context Based IRE Usually, the searched queries are short or lack of intent be- hind the search. These queries might generate ambiguous results that the users do not expect. The current system de- signs fetch results using text processing techniques like tok- enization and lemmatization in the Indic query entered or by extracting the exact matching query. However, it does not generate similar results or semantically rich results. For ex- ample, suppose the query ’Ram aur unke putra’ is entered. In that case, the IRE system should be able to identify the semantics and relationship between the components ’Ram’ and ’Putra’ and generate relevant results containing details about ’Luv’ and ’Kush’ [4, 17, 24]. By using natural language processing technologies, word similarity techniques, ontology techniques, etc., to under- stand the nature of the words and queries, the search results can be improved. Controlled vocabularies, dictionaries, the- saurus, and taxonomies are some of the basic ontology tech- niques that are used during the annotation. In text-based re- trieval, these techniques improve the extraction of the infor- mation easily. The other method that can be used to achieve semantic Information retrieval is treating words as entities or concepts. In concept indexing, instances(entities) and ab- stract ideas(concepts) are identiﬁed within a text document and are linked to the ontological concepts. Methods like WordNet [13], OpenCyc [12] and ConceptNet [9] can be used to achieve some results in the case of Indic languages. Additionally, the search results in the current system can be improved by using Query Expansion(QE) [2] [3]. QE is performed by broadening the query by introducing additional keywords within the originally entered query. These usually include abbreviations, synonyms, antonyms, hyponyms, and hypernyms.
