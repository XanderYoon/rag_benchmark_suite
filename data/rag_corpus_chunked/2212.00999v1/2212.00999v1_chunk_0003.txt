preprocessing to make it suitable for the re- trieval models. Current state-of-the-art methods like Word- Net [13], ConceptNet [18] are trained on large datasets for Roman and Latin scripts. Similar datasets are tedious to build due to the reasons stated in 2.1. Thus, the unavailabil- ity of quality data for this task hinders the progress in the ﬁeld. Recently, several groups from NDLI, IIT Kharagpur, have converted and digitalized a large number of historical documents like ”Bhagawadgitha”. These documents can act as a large dataset if annotated. However, even if it is present, the dataset is majorly noisy. Modern text recognition algo- rithms in this space are not designed to handle such noisy data and hence perform poorly. Figure 1: In this system, old and degraded document images are passed through an OCR, which hampers the quality of the generated text. The ﬁgure shows an example of a sample degraded document in Bangla language. Figure 1 shows a few examples of the data from the Bangla documents. The noise might include the warped lines within the documents, watermarked pages and traces of ink from the backside of the page. 2.3. Semantics and Context based Retrievals Web Search Engines and Information Retrieval are two aspects where web search is just a spectrum of Information retrieval. The information which is given as an input to the search bar does not always represent the practical and re- quired information that a user demands. Understanding the rich semantic and context behind a text query is extremely important for the search engines to return relevant results. For instance, in the search engines Yahoo and Bing, if a per- son enters a search query ’Nokia’, the results generated will be all the links containing Nokia, irrespective of their us- ability for the user. Whereas in Google
