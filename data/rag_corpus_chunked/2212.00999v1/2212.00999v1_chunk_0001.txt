the desired query. Short queries might not explain the full in- tent behind the search. However, suppose the Information Retrieval and Extraction systems (IRE) can be made capa- ble in terms of obtaining semantically and contextually rich information from the ocean of data. In that case, it will im- prove the user experience. It will also help in the direction of extracting the required query. This work focuses on multimedia retrieval (image and text in Indic languages) in this IRE system, where the user enters a text query for which the system returns books that are indexed and ranked. Multilingual OCR [8, 11] is used to achieve this task. We know that optical Character Recog- nition (OCR) is the process of conversion of text or text- containing documents such as handwritten text, printed or scanned text images into a digital format that can be used for further processes. In this system, text recognition is per- formed on ancient Indic language documents. The ﬁnal in- formation retrieval system’s goal is to demonstrate the high accuracy of the Indic OCR and the retrieval of the ancient texts in Indic languages. The challenges faced by IRE systems in Indic language scenarios are discussed in Section 2. Section 3 consists of the details and functionalities of the OCR Search Engine designed by the authors. Section 4 represents the ideas that can be implemented on top of the existing system. 2. Practical Challenges associated with Indian IRE systems Modern state-of-the-art IRE systems suffer from vari- ous challenges for Indian data. These challenges can vary among different areas within information retrieval. These areas majorly include cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) [10], Web search, user modeling, ﬁltering, classiﬁ- cation, summarization, question answering, metasearch, se- mantic, and context-based search and extraction [1].
