them. As the current OCR system uses line-level segmentation, the line in which the query is present is highlighted for making it easier for the users to search it. 3.3.2 Server End The Admin can Login inside the IRE system and assign various roles to the other admins, whether they can alter the entries in the database or just monitor them. Database Sta- tus can be viewed as a graph that gives the total number of pages and the total number of books added within the entire Figure 5: Clicking ”View” will open a new taskbar where users can view and read the entire book. database over a period. Featured datasets lists the datasets present within the system (currently by the National Digital Library Data). Manual Updates to the database are also possible. The Admin can edit/delete the books’ details, including Ab- stract, ISBN and Author. 3.4. System Implementation The backend of the IRE system is built over the top of Django/python, and the frontend uses HTML/CSS and Javascript. The pages are indexed using Elasticsearch. The dynamic components of these IRE systems include the Search results, ﬁlters, visualization where the query searched is highlighted, admin authentication, and manu- ally updating the database. The admin/supervisor has the right to completely mod- ify/delete/edit the dataset/database manually/automatically depending on his/her needs. This will not affect the already available dataset/database present in the system. Workﬂow: Users can view the retrieved results (retrieved books w.r.t. to the query searched), the highlighted queries, meta details, and the complete book(s). The download op- tions are currently unavailable. The users do not need to log in to use the system, and this makes the search and the generated results accessible for everyone to view and read. 4. Future Work These are the few proposed ideas that can be
