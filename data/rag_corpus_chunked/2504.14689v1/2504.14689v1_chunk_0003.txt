Drawing insight from the intellect augmentation framework conceptualized by Douglas Engelbart [6], we argue that while current AI systems and interaction paradig ms may enhance the demonstrated critical thinking, they do not necessarily improve the performed critical thinking. We also discuss design considerations t o accomplish the latter. 2 DEFINITION AND EV ALUATION OF CRITICAL THINKING Critical thinking has been conceptualized through various frameworks over decades of research in education and psy- chology [2, 7, 18]. Its deﬁnition varies from a general deﬁni tion to a procedural process. Ennis [7] describes critical thinking as the correct assessing of statements . Scriven and Paul [18] deﬁne it as a “a disciplined process th at actively and skillfully conceptualize, apply, analyze, synthesize, and evaluate information gathered from or generated by obs er- vation, experience, reﬂection, reasoning or communicatio n, to guide one’s belief and action”. Similarly focusing on t he process, Bloom et al. [2] identiﬁes six cognitive activities that occur during critical thinking: knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. The deﬁnitions by Ennis [7] and Scriven and Paul [18] align w ith what we term performed critical thinking—independent cognitive processes witho ut external assistance. Yet all components within the deﬁnition by Bloom et al. [2] can be either perform ed independently or demonstrated through human-AI collaboration. Researchers in psychology and education have adopted vario us quantitative and qualitative approaches to evaluate critical thinking [4, 5]. Via a quantitative approach, researchers develop standardized tests or instruments [8–10, 2 2]. In qualitative assessment, researchers such as open-ended qu estions and augmentative writing, as well as online discus- sion [20, 24]. Across these tools, some tend to measure critical disposition [8]—the tendency to think critically—wher eas the others measure performance or application of critical t hinking [22]. To examine the latter, Watson and
