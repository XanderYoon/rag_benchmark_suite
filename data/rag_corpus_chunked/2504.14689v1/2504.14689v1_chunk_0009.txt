Manuscript submitted to ACM Designing AI Systems that Augment Human Performed vs. Demon strated Critical Thinking 5 5 CONCLUSION The rapid development and integration of AI systems in our everyday lives raises questions not only for their impact on human cognitive abilities but also for established concepts and methodologies in research. Focusing on critical thinking, this position paper identiﬁes the need to further distingui sh types of critical thinking in the era of AI: performed versus demonstrated critical thinking. Via such distinction, we discuss the nua nces in current research ﬁndings regarding the impact of AI systems on human critical thinking, calling for explicit considerations of this distinction in future stud ies. More importantly, such a distinction implicates our design of AI systems to augment critical thinking. We encourage researchers and developers to keep this distinction in mind as systems that augment demonstrated critical thinking are not the same as those that augment performed critical thinking.
