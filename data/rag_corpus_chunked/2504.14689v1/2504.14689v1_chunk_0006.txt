a qualitative assessment of students’ dialogue in a classroom setting. Future research should als o consider longitudinal frameworks that track changes in independent cognitive abilities over time. 4 AUGMENTING PERFORMED VS. DEMONSTRATED CRITICAL THINKING Designing technology to augment human capabilities has been one of the major objectives of technology development. In 1962, Engelbart [6] presents the intellect augmentation framework to delineate how we can design artifacts to augment human capabilities. He considers augmentation is a chieved if humans are more eﬃcient in ﬁnding better solutions to complex problems. Engelbart [6] indicates tha t there are processes (”little steps or actions”) that take place in humans’ problem solving. Intellect augmentation can be accomplished by making any of these processes eﬃcient and better. It is worth noting that within his framework, intellect augmentation is not of human but of a system where humans with augmenta- tion means—which he referred as “ H-LAM/T ” system (Humans using Language, Artifacts, and Methodology). Deta iled description of each component is included in Table 2. While Engelbart’s framework provides an insightful road ma p for intellect augmentation, the rapid evolution of AI and intelligent technologies has necessitated expandin g these foundational ideas. Xia and Maes [25] provides a new interpretation of intellect that goes beyond problem so lving, extending it to other cognitive domains of human capabilities such as memory, motivation, and decision maki ng. Building upon the intellect augmentation framework, they derive steps for designing artifacts that support augm entation of diﬀerent cognitive domains: 1) consider the Manuscript submitted to ACM 4 Mei et al. desired state after augmentation ; 2) identify the processes for the task ; 3) identify how artifacts can change a process or processes. Based on these augmentation frameworks, we interpret what i t means to augment human critical thinking via
