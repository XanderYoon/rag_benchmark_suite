Based on this line of work, this pos ition paper proposes a distinction between performed critical thinking and demonstrated critical thinking. In the context of human-AI interaction,we deﬁne performed critical thinking as cognitive process undertaken by humans independent of AI assistance. In contrast, demonstrated critical thinking refers to either the process or product of critical thinkingthat occurs through the assistance of or collaboration with generative AI systems. These distinctions are important since the choice of interpretation could lead to diﬀerent implications for i) research that examines the impact of generative AI on critical thinki ng and ii) divergent design objectives for AI systems to augment human critical thinking. We identify that current evaluation on the impact of GenAI on critical thinking skills often focuses on demonstrated rather than performed critical thinking and provide considerations for future re search designs. Drawing insight from the intellect augmentation framework conceptualized by Douglas Engelbart [6], we argue that while current AI systems and interaction paradig ms may enhance the demonstrated critical thinking, they do not necessarily improve the performed critical thinking. We also discuss design considerations t o accomplish the latter. 2 DEFINITION AND EV ALUATION OF CRITICAL THINKING Critical thinking has been
