diversity. For example, for title-based docids, the model is forced to memorize document-docid mappings rather than generalize. When using titles as docids, the model associates specific phrases (e.g., “Climate Change Impacts”) with fixed document identifiers. During inference, this rigid mapping fails when new documents introduce title variants (e.g., “Global Warming Effects”). In contrast, the high- dimensional space of n-gram docids encourages the model to learn distributional patterns rather than discrete mappings. By exposing the model to diverse substrings during training, it becomes more robust to lexical variations in new documents. To measure the lexical diversity of different docids, we compute the effective vocabulary size, i.e., the number of unique words uti- lized by the docids of all documents in the corpus. As quantified SIGIR ’25, July 13–18, 2025, Padua, Italy Zhen Zhang et al. Table 5: Dimensional comparison n-gram vs. other types. Docid Type Title URL N-gram Numeric Size 5,736 17,195 53,544 32–10,000 in Table 5, n-gram docids use effective vocabulary sizes that are 10–100× larger than Title or URL docids and 100–1000× larger than numeric-based docids. This expanded dimensional space ensures that even high-frequency n-grams in initial documents occupy only a small fraction of the total capacity, forcing the model to learn generalized substring generation patterns rather than memorizing fixed mappings. 6 Enhancing Numeric Docids While text-based docids (e.g., n-grams) exhibit superior general- ization in dynamic corpora, they have several limitations: (i) high computational overhead due to complex constrained decoding (e.g., FM-index traversal for n-gram matching), (ii) memory inefficiency from storing massive text fragments, and (iii) incompatibility with non-textual data (e.g., tables, images). Conversely, numeric-based docids offer inherent advantages in storage efficiency (fixed-length numbers) and decoding speed (simple token generation), but their fixed semantic encoding limits dynamic adaptability. This leads to the natural question of how to combine the
