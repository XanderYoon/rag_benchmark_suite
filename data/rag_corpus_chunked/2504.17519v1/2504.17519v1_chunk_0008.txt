the Introduction Section, retraining or continuing training the GR model would cost much more compu- tational overhead. Therefore, our work only focuses on the second paradigm, where the Retriever must leverage learned knowledge to handle novel documents through constrained decoding over the updated prefix tree T ′ D. This setting tests the model’s ability to generalize to unseen document representations without parameter updates. 2.3 Evaluation metrics Our evaluation primarily focuses on two aspects of model perfor- mance over dynamic corpora: (i) retrieve initial documents, which assesses the model’s ability to maintain performance on queries targeting original documents D0; and (ii) retrieve newly added doc- uments, which evaluates the model’s capacity to retrieve novel documents Dnew. We use Hit@10 as the primary metric in both settings and further introduce formal metrics to summarize the model’s performance as new documents are incrementally indexed. Retrieve initial documents. To assess the model’s forgetting be- havior when indexing new documents, we define the forgetting metric 𝐹𝑛, which quantifies the degradation in retrieval perfor- mance on queries targeting the original corpus D0 after indexing corpus D1 to D𝑛: Definition 1 (Forgetting Metric 𝐹𝑛). 𝐹𝑛 = 1 𝑛 𝑛∑︁ 𝑜=1 max 𝑃0,0 − 𝑃𝑜,0, 0 (4) where 𝑃𝑜,0 represents the retrieval performance (e.g., Hit@10) of queries in D0 after indexing corpus D𝑜 . Retrieve newly added documents.To measure the model’s ability to generalize and retrieve newly indexed documents, we define the generalization performance metric 𝐺𝐴𝑛, which captures how well the model retrieves queries associated with incrementally added documents: Definition 2 (Generalization Performance 𝐺𝐴𝑛). 𝐺𝐴𝑛 = 1 𝑛 𝑛∑︁ 𝑜=1 𝑃𝑜,𝑜 (5) where 𝑃𝑜,𝑜 represents the retrieval performance on queries targeting D𝑜 after indexing corpus D𝑜 . 3 Experimental Setup 3.1 Datasets We conduct our experiments on two widely used datasets: Natural Questions (NQ) [13] and MS-MARCO [1].
