GR frame- work MDGR that combines the structured benefits of numeric- based docids with a revised design to avoid training-induced biases, achieving competitive performance in dynamic corpora scenario. Our findings not only highlight the critical role of docid semantics and representation in GR frameworks but also provide actionable guidelines for adapting generative retrieval to real-world dynamic environments. Future work may explore hybrid docid strategies or pretraining-enhanced generalization mechanisms to further bridge the gap between static and dynamic retrieval performance.
