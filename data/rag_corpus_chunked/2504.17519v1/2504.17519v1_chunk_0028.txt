We ini- tialize the model with pre-trained weights from Hugging Face’s T5-base checkpoint. Following previous work, the training objec- tive includes three parts: (i) Training with synthetic queries. Minimize the loss between generated pseudo-queries and their cor- responding docids. (ii) Encoding document contexts. Minimize the loss between each document chunk 𝑐𝑖 and its original docid. (iii) Incorporating real queries. Minimize the loss between user queries and target docids. For training, we employ the AdamW optimizer with a base learn- ing rate of 1 × 10−5 and a linear warmup over the first 10% of training steps. We set the batch size to 64 and train for 10 epochs, which requires approximately 4 hours on 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs.
