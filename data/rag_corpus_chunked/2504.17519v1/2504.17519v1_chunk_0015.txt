Generative retrieval models exhibit huge divergence in gen- eralization performance ( 𝐺𝐴𝑛): Numeric-based docid (e.g., DSI- SE, Ultron-PQ) demonstrate critical limitations in adapting to un- seen documents. DSI-SE’s𝐺𝐴𝑛 values (0.209 on NQ, 0.184 on MS- MARCO) align with its severe Hits@10 degradation when retriev- ing new documents (e.g., dropping from 0.718 to 0.205 on NQ’s D5). This failure stems from rigid numeric docid mappings learned during training, which lack inherent semantic connections to new content. Similarly, Ultron-PQ’s numeric identifiers yield unstable 𝐺𝐴𝑛 (0.542 on NQ, 0.400 on MS-MARCO), as its quantization-based docid system struggles to encode novel document semantics with- out retraining. Text-based docid methods, such as SEAL and LTRGR, demon- strate much more promising results. For example, LTRGR attain 𝐺𝐴𝑛 = 0.799 on NQ, with only a 0.089 Hits@10 drop from D0 to D5, outperforming even optimized dense retrieval (DPR-HN: 𝐺𝐴𝑛 = 0.632). SEAL’s n-gram docids similarly excel (𝐺𝐴𝑛 = 0.732 on NQ). This suggests that text-based docids, such as n-grams or ti- tles, offer more flexibility and generalization. Text-based docids can inherently adapt to newly added documents, which often contain similar linguistic features. Consequently, models using text-based docids are better equipped to maintain high retrieval performance as the corpus evolves. These models can leverage the semantic richness of text-based representations,
