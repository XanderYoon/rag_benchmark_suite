each element 𝑧𝑡 ∈ [ 𝐾] is drawn a predefined vocabulary 𝑉 , which may include numerical tokens, lexical items, or other semantic identifiers. There are mainly two types of docid design: numeric-based and text-based: • numeric-based: Each document corresponds to a numeric se- quence, typically generated by converting document embeddings into numeric sequences using clustering or quantization meth- ods. • text-based: Uses metadata from documents as docid, generally including elements such as title, query, URL, n-gram, etc. As for the retriever, upon taking a user query 𝑞 ∈ Q , the Retriever generates the most relevant docid by maximizing the conditional probability over the sequence of tokens representing the docid: 𝑃 (𝑧1, 𝑧2, . . . , 𝑧𝑀 | 𝑞; 𝜃 ) = 𝑀Ö 𝑡 =1 𝑃 𝑧𝑡 | 𝑧1, . . . , 𝑧𝑡 −1, 𝑞; 𝜃, (1) where 𝜃 denotes the model parameters, 𝑀 is the predefined do- cid length, and {𝑧1, . . . , 𝑧𝑡 −1} represents the previously generated tokens. During inference, the system performs beam search to find: ˆz = argmax z∈ TD 𝑃 (𝑧1:𝑀 |𝑞; 𝜃 ), (2) where a prefix tree (TD) enforces constrained decoding by storing all valid docid prefixes from the corpora D. At each decoding step 𝑡, token selection is restricted to the children nodes of the current prefix 𝑧1:𝑡 −1 in TD, ensuring generated sequences correspond to existing documents. Replication and Exploration of Generative Retrieval over Dynamic Corpora SIGIR ’25, July 13–18, 2025, Padua, Italy 2.2 Task formulation The dynamic corpora involves continuously adapting to an expand- ing document collection while maintaining retrieval capabilities. Initially, we are given: • an initial document set D0 = {𝑑1, 𝑑2, . . . , 𝑑𝑛 }, and • corresponding query-document pairs P0 = {⟨𝑞𝑖, 𝑑𝑗 ⟩ | 𝑞𝑖 ∈ Q,
