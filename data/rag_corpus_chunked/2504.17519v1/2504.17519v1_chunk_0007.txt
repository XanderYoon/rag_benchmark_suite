Corpora SIGIR ’25, July 13–18, 2025, Padua, Italy 2.2 Task formulation The dynamic corpora involves continuously adapting to an expand- ing document collection while maintaining retrieval capabilities. Initially, we are given: • an initial document set D0 = {𝑑1, 𝑑2, . . . , 𝑑𝑛 }, and • corresponding query-document pairs P0 = {⟨𝑞𝑖, 𝑑𝑗 ⟩ | 𝑞𝑖 ∈ Q, 𝑑𝑗 ∈ D 0}, where each document 𝑑 𝑗 ∈ D 0 is a text sequence and Q = {𝑞1, 𝑞2, . . . ,𝑞𝑚 } denotes the initial query set. A GR model is first trained using standard sequence-to-sequence objectives on P0. The core challenge arises with incremental updates: when new documents Dnew = {𝑑𝑛+1, . . . , 𝑑𝑛+𝑘 } are introduced. For each new document 𝑑𝑛+𝑖 ∈ D new, the indexer generates a corresponding docid: z𝑛+𝑖 = {𝑧 (𝑛+𝑖 ) 1 , . . . , 𝑧(𝑛+𝑖 ) 𝑀 }, 𝑧 (𝑛+𝑖 ) 𝑡 ∈ { 1, . . . , 𝐾}, (3) preserving the original token vocabulary and sequence length 𝑀. These new identifiers are incorporated into the existing prefix tree TD. The retriever must then handle the expanded search space D′ = D0 ∪ Dnew. Two adaptation strategies emerge: (i) Model adap- tation: Continuously train or retrain the model on P0 ∪ Pnew to learn updated document representations. (ii) Index adaptation: Maintain frozen model parameters while updating only the index- ing structures. As mentioned in the Introduction Section, retraining or continuing training the GR model would cost much more compu- tational overhead. Therefore, our work only focuses on the second paradigm, where the Retriever must leverage learned knowledge to handle novel documents through constrained decoding over the updated prefix tree T ′ D. This setting tests the model’s ability to generalize to unseen document representations
