factors of text-based docid design, we conduct an ablation study across three aspects: (i) Docid type, where we compare different docid types, such as title, URL, n-grams, etc. (ii) Docid granularity, where we compare docids defined at different levels of granularity, including document, paragraph, sentence, and n-gram levels. (iii) Docid lexical diversity, where we compare the number of possible tokens used in different docid designs. Docid type. First, we examine various forms of text-based docids, including URLs, titles, pseudo queries, and n-grams, to evaluate their effectiveness over dynamic corpora. Table 4 shows the results on NQ dataset for retrieval on initial documents and new documents. We observe that the n-gram repre- sentation of docids outperforms other text-based representations with newly added documents, and also shows competitive results for initial documents in dynamic corpora. Furthermore, this ad- vantage stems from the inherent alignment between the n-gram representation and the pre-training objectives of language models, as both explicitly model local semantic structures through sequen- tial token prediction, enabling n-gram docids to better adapt to the model’s retrieval behavior in dynamic corpora.

Docid granularity. We can define text-based docids at different levels of granularity. For example, when using the title, we essen- tially define the docid at the document level, where a single docid represents the entire document. In contrast, for an n-gram-based docid, any substring at any position within the document can serve as a docid to characterize the document, making it a special case of a multi-docid design. A finer-grained docid design may enable more nuanced matching between queries and documents and pro- vides greater flexibility in
