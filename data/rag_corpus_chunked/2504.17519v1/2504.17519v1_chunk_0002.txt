In recent years, a new retrieval para- digm, generative retrieval (GR) has emerged and garnered increas- ing attention due to its end-to-end training and remarkable perfor- mance [14, 24, 34, 37]. In this paradigm, all information of corpus is encoded into the parameters of a generative language model and such a model then directly generates document identifiers (do- cids) for a given query. Specifically, generative retrieval primarily consists of two steps: (i)training as indexing: through training objec- tives that map queries or documents to their associated docids, the model memorizes the document into its parameters during training and learns the mapping relationship between queries and docids. (ii) generation as retrieval : upon receiving a query, the model directly generates the corresponding docids autoregressively. Existing work has shown that the design of docid plays a critical role in the perfor- mance of GR models [28, 35, 38]. According to the type of docid, GR methods can be divided into two categories:numeric-based methods that convert documents into numeric sequences via quantization arXiv:2504.17519v1 [cs.IR] 24 Apr 2025 SIGIR ’25, July 13–18, 2025, Padua, Italy Zhen Zhang et al. strategies (hierarchical k-means [ 30], product quantization [ 36], residual quantization [33]), and text-based methods that leverage titles, URLs, or n-grams as docids [2, 5]. However, most GR approaches are built and evaluated in static scenarios, where the document collection remains fixed [9, 17, 29, 32]. Although these models perform strongly in such settings, their effectiveness in real-world environments, where documents contin- uously evolve over time, has not been thoroughly evaluated
