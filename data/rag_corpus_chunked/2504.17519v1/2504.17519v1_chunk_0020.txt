Lower is better. To quantify the retrieval bias toward initial documents, we in- troduce the Initial Document Bias Index (IDBI) . Definition 3 (Initial Document Bias Index (IDBI)). The IDBI measures the discrepancy between the observed proportion of initial documents retrieved in the Top-𝐾 results and their expected proportion under an unbiased distribution. It is defined as: IDBI = 𝑅init − 𝐸init 𝐾 − 𝐸init , (7) where: 𝑅init is the number of retrieved initial documents in the Top- 𝐾 results. 𝐸init = 𝐾 × | D0 | | D0∪D new | is the expected count of initial documents under a uniform distribution. Remark. The IDBI assumes that initial documents D0 and new documents Dnew are drawn from the same latent query-document relevance distribution. The index is normalized within the range [0, 1], where: IDBI = 0 indicates no bias (i.e., retrieved documents are proportional to their corpus distribution). IDBI = 1 indicates complete bias toward initial documents. As shown in Figure 1, numeric-based docids (e.g., GenRET, Ultron- PQ) exhibit significant retrieval bias toward initial documents across both task settings. This aligns with our hypothesis that numeric- based representations introduce a semantic gap, making it harder for the model to associate new documents with their identifiers.
