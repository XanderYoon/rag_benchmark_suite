and generative retrieval approaches. Sparse retrieval. (i) BM25 [26], a traditional retrieval approach that ranks documents according to the frequency of the term and the normalization of the length of the document. We re-index the entire corpora when the corpora is updated. Dense retrieval. (i) DPR [10], a neural retrieval method that uses dual encoders to map queries and documents into a shared dense vector space for similarity computation. We use the document en- coder trained on D0 to re-encode the newly added documents for retrieval. (ii) DPR-HN [20, 25], an enhanced DPR variant that incor- porates hard negative sampling techniques. It integrates in-batch negatives, top-K retrieved negatives from dense retrievers, and BM25 hard negatives. Generative retrieval. (i) DSI-SE [30], which uses the hierarchical k-means clustering results of document embeddings as docids and trains the model to memorize the documents in parameters. (ii) Ul- tron-PQ [36] uses the product quantization results of document embeddings as docids and designs a three-stage training task to enable the model to memorize the documents. (iii) Ultron-URL [36], a variant of Ultron, uses the document URLs as docids. (iv) NCI [31] uses a prefix-aware weight-adaptive decoder and various query SIGIR ’25, July 13–18, 2025, Padua, Italy Zhen Zhang et al.
