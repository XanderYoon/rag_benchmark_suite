how well the model retrieves queries associated with incrementally added documents: Definition 2 (Generalization Performance 𝐺𝐴𝑛). 𝐺𝐴𝑛 = 1 𝑛 𝑛∑︁ 𝑜=1 𝑃𝑜,𝑜 (5) where 𝑃𝑜,𝑜 represents the retrieval performance on queries targeting D𝑜 after indexing corpus D𝑜 . 3 Experimental Setup 3.1 Datasets We conduct our experiments on two widely used datasets: Natural Questions (NQ) [13] and MS-MARCO [1]. We appropriately par- tition the document sets within the datasets to simulate dynamic corpora scenarios. To simulate the task of dynamic corpora, we partition the docu- ments sets in MS-MARCO and NQ through a two-phase process: (i) Initial corpus construction: Collect all documents and ran- domly select 50% as the initial corpus D0. Extract query-document pairs associated with D0 and split them into a training set P0 and an initial test set Q0. All models are fully trained on P0, simulating initialization on the base corpus. (ii)Incremental document addi- tions: Partition the remaining 50% of documents into five equally sized subsets, each comprising 10% of the original corpus (D1 to D5). For each D𝑖 (1 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 5), extract its associated query-docu- ment pairs to form incremental test sets Q1 to Q5. No additional training is performed for these document sets—models only index new documents upon each addition. 3.2 Retrieval approaches To compare the performance of GR approaches with previous re- trieval methods on dynamic corpora, we selected three types of retrieval approaches: sparse retrieval approaches, dense retrieval approaches, and generative retrieval approaches. Sparse retrieval. (i) BM25 [26], a traditional retrieval approach that ranks documents according to the frequency of the term and the normalization of the length of the document. We re-index the entire corpora when the corpora is updated. Dense retrieval. (i) DPR [10], a neural retrieval method that uses dual encoders to map queries and documents
