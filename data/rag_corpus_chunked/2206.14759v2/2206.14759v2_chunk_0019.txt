Models perfectly memo- rizing their positive training instances (i.e., relevant documents for test queries) would rank these documents at substantially higher positions than models that did not see the same instance during training. However, while the mean rank of leaked relevant documents improves for most cases, the improvement is mostly negligible. For instance, the mean rank of leaked relevant documents for the very eﬀective monoT5 and monoBERT models improves only slightly compared to their no-leakage counterparts on all three corpora. But the diﬀerence increases (still rather negligibly, though) on the corpora on which leakage was more ef- fective. In combination with the high standard deviations, one can hardly see memorization eﬀects for the positions of leaked relevant documents in the ﬁnal rankings. We thus also inspect the retrieval scores of the leaked documents.
