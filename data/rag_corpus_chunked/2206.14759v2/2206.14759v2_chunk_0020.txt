ﬁnal rankings. We thus also inspect the retrieval scores of the leaked documents. Table 7 shows the mean retrieval score of the relevant documents when they were included during training (with leakage) or not (without leakage).

The diﬀerence between the score diﬀerences of leakage models and non-leakage models is larger for leakage from the test data than for MSM leakage in 13 of the 15 cases (with a maximum diﬀerence for monoT5 from a test leakage diﬀer- ence of 0.67 = 2 .37 − 1.70 to an MSM leakage diﬀerence of0.14 = 1 .19 − 1.05). To investigate the “full picture” with respect to also negative leaked instances (i.e., non-relevant documents), we next also study the rank oﬀsets between the positive and the negative leaked instances. 12 Fröbe et al.
