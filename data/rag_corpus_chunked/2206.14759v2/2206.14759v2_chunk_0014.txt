helps more than leakage from MS MARCO / ORCAS (MSM; exceptions: MFR of monoT5 and Precision@1 of monoBERT). Overall, on Robust04, models trained with MSM leakage are often less eﬀective than their no-leakage counterparts (e.g., the nDCG@10 of monoBERT). A possible expla- nation might be the large time gap between the Robust04 document publication dates (documents published between 1987 and 2007) and the MS MARCO data (crawled in 2018). A similar observation was made during the TREC 2021 Deep Learning track [9]. The transition from Version 1 of MS MARCO to Version 2 (crawled three years later) caused some models to prefer older documents since they saw old documents as positive instances and newer ones as negative in- stances during training. Still, MSM leakage can lead to swaps in model ranking on Robust04. For instance, KNRM trained with MSM leakage achieves a higher nDCG@10 and Precision@1 than Duet without leakage, while KNRM trained without leakage is less eﬀective than Duet. 9 We use MFR instead of the mean reciprocal rank (MRR) as suggested by Fuhr [18]. His criticism of MRR was recently supported by further empirical evidence [48]. How Train–Test Leakage Aﬀects Zero-shot Retrieval 9 T able 4.Eﬀectiveness on Common Core 2017 (CC17) as nDCG@10, mean ﬁrst rank of a relevant document (MFR), and Precision@1 (Prec@1) in a ﬁve-fold cross-validation setup on all test topics. Models are trained with no leakage (No), leakage from MS MARCO / ORCAS (MSM), or leakage from the test data (Test).
