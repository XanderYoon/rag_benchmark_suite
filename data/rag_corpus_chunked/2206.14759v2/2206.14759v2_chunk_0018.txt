from MS MARCO. In- terestingly, MSM leakage-induced nDCG@10 improvements sometimes can lead to swaps in model ordering despite the improvements not being signiﬁcant in most cases. This exempliﬁes that experimental eﬀectiveness comparisons might be invalid when some models had access to leaked instances during training. Memorization of Leaked Instances.To analyze whether the models memorize leaked instances, we compare the retrieval scores and resulting ranks of leaked documents in the test rankings when training includes or does not include leak- age.Forleakeddocumentsnotreturnedinthetop-100BM25results—themodels only re-rank these—, we determine a hypothetical rank by calculating the score of this document for the query and inserting the document at the correspond- ing rank in the to-be-re-ranked 100 documents (including breaking score-ties by document ID). Each leaked document thus has a maximal rank of 101. How Train–Test Leakage Aﬀects Zero-shot Retrieval 11 T able 7.Mean retrieval score of the (leaked) relevant training documents (± standard deviation; higher scores = “more relevant”) for models trained with / without leakage from MS MARCO / ORCAS (MSM) or the test data (Test). Scores macro-averaged over all topics for test leakage and over all topics with leaking queries for MSM leakage.
