In contrast to Robust04, more models improve their eﬀectiveness when trained with MSM leakage as the time gap between the New York Times Annotated Corpus and MS MARCO is smaller than for Robust04. MonoT5 with actual test leakage is the most eﬀective model for all three measures, and monoT5 trained on MSM leakage is more eﬀective than the no-leakage counterpart in nDCG@10 and MFR. MSM leakage also may cause model order swaps at higher positions in the systems’ nDCG@10 ordering: monoBERT with MSM leakage would slightly overtake PACRR. Still, most of the eﬀectiveness improvements on this dataset caused by MSM leakage or test leakagearenotsigniﬁcant(exception:thenDCG@10diﬀerencesformonoT5with test leakage and KNRM with MSM leakage to the no-leakage counterparts). 10 Fröbe et al.
