an arbitrary generative model can be adopted. 4.2 Retrieval Evaluator It is natural to wonder whether the retrieved docu- ments are accurate or not before using them, which is significant since irrelevant or misleading mes- sages can be identified in this way. The accuracy of the retrieval evaluator undeniably plays a pivotal role in shaping the overall system performance, as it influences the outcomes of subsequent processes. x: Who was the screenwriter for Death of a Batman? d1d2Retrieval Input Retrieved Documents Ask: If retrieved documents are correct to x?

A retrieval evaluator is constructed to evaluate the relevance of the retrieved documents to the input, and estimate a confidence degree based on which different knowledge retrieval actions of {Correct, Incorrect, Ambiguous} can be triggered. Our objective is to correct the retrieved documents if they are irrelevant. Specifically, T5-large (Raffel et al., 2020) is adopted for initializing the retrieval evaluator and fine-tuned. Its parameter size is much smaller than the most current LLMs (Touvron et al., 2023a,b; Chowdhery et al., 2023; Anil et al., 2023; Brown et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022; OpenAI, 2023). To ensure all experimental results were comparable with Self-RAG (Asai et al., 2024), the same retrieval results through Contriever (Izacard et al., 2022) provided by Self-RAG were also adopted in our experiments. The relevance signals for fine-tuning the evaluator can be collected from the existing datasets. For example, PopQA (Mallen et al., 2023) provides the golden subject wiki title from wikipedia for each question. We can use that to track a not 100% relevant
