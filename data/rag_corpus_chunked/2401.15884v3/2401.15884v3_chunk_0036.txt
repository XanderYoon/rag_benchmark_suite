Knowledge: Google Search API was adopted to search for the relevant URLs, top-k is set to 5, and pages from Wikipedia will be added preferentially. The searched web pages are generally in the form of HTML files, where content is split with special tokens like <p> and </p>. Thus an extra segmentation like the knowledge refinement is not required, related knowledge paragraphs can be directly selected with the evaluator similar to internal knowledge. In this way, the accuracy of the search outcomes can be ensured without compromising the quality and relevance of the information used for generation. Generator: As CRAG is a plug-and-play method, all generation models that can be uti- lized in RAG fit our approach as well. To be consistent with baselines for comparison, we adopted LLaMA2 (Touvron et al., 2023b) for the generation. We first introduced the LLaMA2-hf- 7b from huggingface to generate responses. Since Self-RAG (Asai et al., 2024) fine-tuned LLaMA2 and reached a new state-of-the-art performance on several tasks, we further utilized the launched model, SelfRAG-LLaMA2-7b, as a new generator to be consistent with their work and study the specific improvement of our method. Self-CRAG: To demonstrate that our plug-and- play approach can be utilized in other concurrent studies, we specifically designed to insert our CRAG into the Self-RAG (Asai et al., 2024) framework and named it Self-CRAG.

It meets our demand for deciding which action
