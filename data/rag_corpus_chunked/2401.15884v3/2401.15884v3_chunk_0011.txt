is conducted individually and integrated eventually. Correct Here, a retrieval is assumed Correct when the confidence score of at least one retrieved document is higher than the upper threshold. If so, it means that there are relevant documents in the retrieved results, and the knowledge from the retrieval results is supposed to be more reliable and accurate. However, even if a relevant document can be found, there is inevitably some noisy knowledge strips in this document. To extract the most critical knowledge strips within this document, a knowledge refinement method is further designed which will be elaborated in Section 4.4. Incorrect Besides, a retrieval is assumed Incorrect when the confidence scores of all retrieved documents are below the lower threshold. This indicates that all retrieved documents are considered irrelevant, which are unhelpful for generation. Once the knowledge from the retrieval results is judged to be inaccurate, it is unwise to still get stuck in it, which is likely to result in fabricated facts. Therefore, we need to seek new sources of knowledge for correction. Here, web search is introduced to search from the Internet as elaborated in Section 4.5. This corrective action helps overcome the embarrassing challenge where no reliable knowledge can be referred to. Ambiguous Except for the above two situations, the remaining will be assigned to an intermediate action of Ambiguous. This generally occurs when the accuracy of the retrieval is hard to distinguish and the evaluator gives an intermediate score. Since the retrieval evaluator is not confident in its judgment, both types of processed knowledge in Correct and Incorrect are combined to comple- ment each other. Implementing such a moderating and soft strategy can significantly contribute to strengthening the robustness and resilience of the system, fostering a more adaptable framework for optimal performance.
