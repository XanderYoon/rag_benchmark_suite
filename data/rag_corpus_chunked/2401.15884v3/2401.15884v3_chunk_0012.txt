an intermediate score. Since the retrieval evaluator is not confident in its judgment, both types of processed knowledge in Correct and Incorrect are combined to comple- ment each other. Implementing such a moderating and soft strategy can significantly contribute to strengthening the robustness and resilience of the system, fostering a more adaptable framework for optimal performance. Discussion Preliminary experiments of employ- ing only the Correct and Incorrect actions show that the efficacy of CRAG was easily affected by the accuracy of the retrieval evaluator. The reason might be the distinct knowledge switch for all input cases, regardless of the level of confidence in their judgment. The design of the Ambiguous action significantly helps to mitigate the dependence on the accuracy of the retrieval evaluator. 4.4 Knowledge Refinement Given a retrieved relevant document, a decompose- then-recompose knowledge refinement method is designed to further extract the most critical knowledge strips in it. To obtain fine-grained retrieval results, we segmented the retrieved results into internal strips. If a retrieved result is as short as one or two sentences, it is regarded as an individual strip, otherwise, retrieval documents are required to be split into smaller units which generally consist of a few sentences according to the total length. The scale is assumed to include an independent piece of information, and the filtering is based on the segments. Then, the retrieval evaluator fine- tuned in Section 4.2 is employed to calculate the relevance score of each knowledge strip. Based on these scores, irrelevant knowledge strips are filtered out, while relevant ones are recomposed via concatenation in order, namely internal knowledge. 4.5 Web Search It would be more intelligent if a system itself could determine that its existing knowledge corpus could not solve the problem well and turn to additional external knowledge for help.
