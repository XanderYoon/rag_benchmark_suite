of each knowledge strip. Based on these scores, irrelevant knowledge strips are filtered out, while relevant ones are recomposed via concatenation in order, namely internal knowledge. 4.5 Web Search It would be more intelligent if a system itself could determine that its existing knowledge corpus could not solve the problem well and turn to additional external knowledge for help. On the contrary, even if a system knows that the existing knowledge cannot solve the problem, but still sticks to the limited knowledge corpus, it will only give a fabricated fact in the end, which is called hallucination.. Therefore, it is extremely important to seek complementary external knowledge if the retrieved results are all assumed irrelevant, and we consider a system that knows what it doesn’t know and what it cannot answer to be more intelligent than one that clings to limited knowledge and is incapable of seeking external knowledge. Since retrieval from static and limited corpora can only return sub-optimal documents in terms of scope and diversity, large-scale web searches (Piktus et al., 2021; Komeili et al., 2022) are integrated as a strategic extension of RAG. Specifically, the inputs are rewritten into queries composed of keywords by ChatGPT to mimic the daily usage of search engine. The prompt for rewriting is shown in Appendix A. In CRAG , a public and accessible commercial web search API is adopted to generate a series of URL links for every query. 3 Considering that knowledge from large-scale web searches could introduce biases or unreliable information, authoritative and regulated web pages like Wikipedia are preferred, which can significantly help mitigate these issues. Moreover, we utilize the URL links to navigate web pages, transcribe their content, and employ the same knowledge refinement method as Section 4.4 to derive the relevant web knowledge, namely external knowledge.
