same retrieval results through Contriever (Izacard et al., 2022) provided by Self-RAG were also adopted in our experiments. The relevance signals for fine-tuning the evaluator can be collected from the existing datasets. For example, PopQA (Mallen et al., 2023) provides the golden subject wiki title from wikipedia for each question. We can use that to track a not 100% relevant but rather high-quality passage. We utilized that as the relevance signals for fine-tuning the retrieval evaluator.2 On the other hand, the negative samples for fine-tuning were all randomly sampled from the retrieval results, which are rather similar to the input query but 2https://huggingface.co/datasets/akariasai/PopQA not relevant. More details about this fine-tuning step can be referred to in Appendix B.3. For every question, there are generally 10 documents retrieved. The question is concatenated with each single document as the input, and the evaluator predicts the relevance score for each question- document pair individually. We also tried to prompt ChatGPT to identify the retrieval relevance for comparison, but it underperforms as elaborated in Section 5.5. Based on these calculated relevance scores, a final judgment is made as to whether the retrieval is correct or not associated with the action trigger. In our proposed framework, the retrieval quality is evaluated at a relatively low cost without the need to have access to large and expensive LLMs. Compared with the critic model of Self-RAG (Asai et al., 2024) that instruction- tuned LLaMA-2 (7B), the evaluator designed in CRAG demonstrates the advantages of being quite lightweight (0.77B).
