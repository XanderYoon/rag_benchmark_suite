It meets our demand for deciding which action to be triggered, thus we replaced the retrieved items in Self-RAG with our processed internal knowledge for Correct, external knowledge for Incorrect, and combined knowledge for Ambiguous. B.4 More Detailed Results Ablation Study: The following results in Table 11 demonstrate the ablation study by triggering one action only for all instances. B.5 Results on PubHealth and Arc-Challenge It is worth mentioning that the performance on PubHealth based on LLaMA2-hf-7b was much worse than others. We studied these cases and found that LLaMA2-hf-7b is relatively weak in instruction comprehension. Most of the cases fail to generate True or False in such a binary- question task, resulting in a low accuracy during the evaluation. This situation somewhat happens in Arc-Challenge as well, when the model is tasked to generate the index of a candidate.
