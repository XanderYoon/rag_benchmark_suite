contributions in this paper are three-fold: 1) This paper studies the scenarios where the retriever returns inaccurate results and, to the best of our knowledge, makes the first attempt to design corrective strategies for RAG to improve its robustness. 2) A plug-and-play method named CRAG is proposed to improve the ability of automatic self-correction and efficient utilization of retrieved documents. 3) Experimental results extensively demonstrate CRAG ’s adaptability to RAG-based approaches and its generalizability across short- and long-form generation tasks. 2 Related Work Hallucinations of LLMs Although LLMs have exhibited impressive abilities to understand instruc- tions and generate fluent language texts (Bang et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2023; Zhong et al., 2023), one of the most severe issues that LLMs have still been struggling with is hallucinations. As many studies found (Tonmoy et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2023b; Shuster et al., 2021), either outdated information or incorrect knowledge that is activated would seriously result in hallucinations. Large-scale unregulated training data collection, low proportion of high-quality sampling data, imperfection of data allocation in the input space, and many other realistic factors could impact the LLMs and exacerbate the problems. Thus, it is obvious that the lack of accurate and specific knowledge can lead to misleading or even inaccurate generation, which will severely hurt the experience of users in most practical applications. Retrieval-Augmented Generation RAG (Lewis et al., 2020; Guu et al., 2020) is regarded as a useful method to address the issues above, which enhances the input questions of generative LMs with retrieved documents. It usually provides an extra knowledge source from a specific corpus, i.e., Wikipedia, which greatly improves the per- formance of LMs in a variety of tasks, especially in the knowledge-intensive ones. The proposed methods generally leverage information retrieval to supply documents containing relevant knowledge for
