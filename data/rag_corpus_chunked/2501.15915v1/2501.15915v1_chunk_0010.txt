inference. To achieve this, we propose a two-step approach: Document Augmentation and Parametric Document Encoding . These steps are combined to generate robust and informative parametric representations for each document. Conference, Under Review, Su, et al.

Existing studies have shown that effectively incorporating factual knowledge from external docu- ments into LLMs requires more than simply pre-training the model on raw text via standard next-token prediction. For example, Allen- Zhu and Li [1] find that after being trained repeatedly on a given document, LLMs can memorize its content but fail to extract and apply this knowledge effectively in downstream tasks such as ques- tion answering. To address this issue, Allen-Zhu and Li [1] propose two key strategies: (1) incorporating question-answer (QA) pairs derived from the document during training and (2) augmenting the document through multiple rewrites that express the same factual content in different forms. Their findings indicate that these two approaches enable LLMs to internalize knowledge to support accu- rate application in downstream tasks rather than reproducing the original text token-by-token2. Building upon the insights discussed above, we introduce the doc- ument augmentation process consisting of two steps: Document Rewriting and QA Pair Generation, to construct robust and in- formative parametric representations for documents. Specifically, for each document, we prompt3 the LLM L to rewrite the content multiple times using different wording, styles, or organizational structures. Formally, each document𝑑𝑖 is transformed into multiple rewritten documents {𝑑𝑖 1, 𝑑𝑖 2, . . . , 𝑑𝑖𝑛 }, which preserve the orig- inal facts but vary in language expression.
