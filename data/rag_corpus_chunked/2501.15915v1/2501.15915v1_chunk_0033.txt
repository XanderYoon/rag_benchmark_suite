Parametric RAG infuses these parameterized documents directly into the model, reducing contextual overload and online computational costs while maintain- ing robust performance. Our experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Parametric RAG outperforms traditional retrieval- augmented generation methods across different LLMs. Ultimately, Parametric RAG offers a more efficient and scalable pathway to integrate external knowledge into LLMs, paving the way for further innovation in parametric-based knowledge augmentation. Despite its significant potential, Parametric RAG presents sev- eral challenges that warrant further investigation. First, the current parameterization process is computationally intensive, and the para- metric representations of each document are substantially larger than plain text. Future work could explore more methods to improve computational and storage efficiency, making the parameterization process more scalable. Second, the parameterized documents are currently tied to specific LLMs, restricting their ability to generalize across different models. Developing universal, model-agnostic rep- resentations could significantly enhance flexibility and reuse across diverse systems. Finally, we believe the potential applications of information parameterization can be extended beyond RAG. For instance, LLM-based agents could benefit from parameterizing the agent’s profiles and configuration, which could alleviate context- length constraints and improve online computational efficiency. By addressing these challenges, future research could unlock more potential for the Parametric RAG paradigm. References [1] Zeyuan Allen-Zhu and Yuanzhi Li. [n. d.].
