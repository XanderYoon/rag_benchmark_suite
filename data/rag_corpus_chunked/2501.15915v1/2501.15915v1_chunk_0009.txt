𝐾𝑃 . Specifically, we define: 𝐾𝑃 = {𝑝𝑖 | 𝑝𝑖 = 𝑓𝜙 (𝑑𝑖 ), 𝑖 = 1, 2, . . . , 𝑁}, (1) where 𝑓𝜙 is a mapping function that converts each document 𝑑𝑖 into its corresponding parametric representation 𝑝𝑖. We define parametric representations 𝑝𝑖 to possess the following properties: (1) The parameters 𝑝𝑖 can be plugged into the feed-forward net- work weights of the LLM. (2) After inserting the parametric representation𝑝𝑖 into 𝐿, the LLM can effectively comprehend the knowledge contained within the corresponding document 𝑑𝑖. (3) Different document parameters 𝑝𝑖 can be merged through spe- cific algorithms, and after merging, the LLM can grasp the combined knowledge corresponding to the merged documents. Online Inference. During the online inference process, our method first merges the parametric representations corresponding to the retrieved top-k documents and then plugs the merged parameters into the LLM. Subsequently, the updated LLM is used to answer the user’s question. This overall framework allows for more efficient and effective knowledge injection, overcoming the limitations of traditional RAG by leveraging parameterized representations of external knowledge. 3.2 Offline Document Parameterization In this subsection, we describe the detailed process of offline param- eterizing each document in the corpus 𝐾 during the pre-processing phase. Given a document 𝑑𝑖 and an LLM L, our objective is to construct a parametric representation 𝑝𝑖 of the document. This representation enables L to effectively comprehend and utilize the knowledge contained in 𝑑𝑖 during inference. To achieve this, we propose a two-step approach: Document Augmentation and Parametric Document Encoding . These steps are combined to generate robust and informative parametric representations for each document. Conference, Under Review, Su, et al.
