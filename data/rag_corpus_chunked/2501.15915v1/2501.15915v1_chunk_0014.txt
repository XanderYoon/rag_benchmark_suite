sequence (document, question, and answer)5. This design inherently encourages the LLM to internalize the factual details in the documents into its parameters during training. Al- though the generated question-answer pairs do not directly cover all the facts within the document, repeated training on the docu- ments’ tokens allows the model to reinforce its understanding of the textual content. Consequently, once the training is complete, the parametric representation Δ𝜃 serves as a lightweight document- specific knowledge representation that can be directly added to the original model L at inference time. Notably, this entire process can be conducted offline, as each document (or batch of documents) is processed to produce its re- spective low-rank representation Δ𝜃. At inference time, we only need to load the LoRA parameters corresponding to the specific document(s) rather than appending the document directly into the LLM’s context. The computational cost of loading these parametric representations constitutes only a minimal portion, approximately 1% of the computation required to decode a single token. 3.2.3 Discussion on LoRA Initialization. In our proposed training framework, the LoRA parameters for each document 𝑑𝑖 are initial- ized randomly without any warm-up stage. This choice is delib- erate and aligns with our goal of developing a general-purpose parametric knowledge injection method rather than one tailored to specific downstream tasks. If not explicitly mentioned other- wise, we initialize LoRA with random values. However, randomized LoRA initialization is not necessarily the most effective way to train parametric document representations. For example, we could pre-train the random LoRA with a couple of few-shot examples following the same method described with Eq. (5) and save the LoRA weight 𝑊𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑚 −𝑢𝑝 to initialize the training of each docu- ment’s LoRA (i.e., the document’s parametric representation). Our experiment (Section § 5.2) demonstrates that this warm-up process can significantly improve the
