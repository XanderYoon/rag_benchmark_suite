parametric document representations. For example, we could pre-train the random LoRA with a couple of few-shot examples following the same method described with Eq. (5) and save the LoRA weight 𝑊𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑚 −𝑢𝑝 to initialize the training of each docu- ment’s LoRA (i.e., the document’s parametric representation). Our experiment (Section § 5.2) demonstrates that this warm-up process can significantly improve the performance compared to random initialization on RAG tasks, indicating that a task-aware initializa- tion can further enhance the effectiveness of parametric knowledge injection for specific downstream tasks. Yet, we use random ini- tialization for LoRA if not mentioned explicitly for simplicity and broad applicability across various tasks. 3.3 Online Inference In the previous stage (§3.2.2), we generated a set of document- specific low-rank parameters for each document in the corpus 𝐾. This section describes how these parameters are utilized for RAG pipelines. Given a user query 𝑞, our proposed Parametric RAG pipeline proceeds through three steps:Retrieve, Update, and Generate. The following section details each step and illustrates the underlying mathematical operations. 3.3.1 Retrieve. We first use a retriever𝑅 to calculate a relevance score 𝑆𝑑𝑖 for each document 𝑑𝑖 ∈ 𝐾 to the query 𝑞. We then select the top-𝑘 documents with the highest relevance scores, denoted 5The loss is computed not only on the answer but also across the entire concatenated sequence, including the documents and the question as {𝑑1, 𝑑2, . . . , 𝑑𝑘 } ⊆ 𝐾 as the relevant external knowledge. Each retrieved document 𝑑𝑖 has a corresponding parametric representa- tion, i.e., a pair of low-rank matrices 𝐴𝑖, 𝐵𝑖 , previously obtained by the procedure described in §3.2.2. 3.3.2 Update. After retrieval, we merge the low-rank matrices from the top-𝑘 retrieved documents to form a single plug-in module for the LLM. Following the setting of LoRA [14]
