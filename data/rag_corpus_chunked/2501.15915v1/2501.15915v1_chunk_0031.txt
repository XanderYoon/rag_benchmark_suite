Performance remains consis- tent across different setups, regardless of whether a smaller, larger, or the same model as the generator is used for data augmentation. Importantly, using a small model for augmentation yields compa- rable results to employing significantly larger models, indicating that the augmentation step does not require high-capacity models to be effective. Similarly, when the same model is used for both generation and augmentation, the outcomes are indistinguishable from those where separate models are employed. 5.5 Runtime Analysis We present the inference time for the LLaMA3-8B model across various RAG baselines on 2WikiMultihopQA (2WQA) and Com- plexWebQuestions (CWQ) in Table 4. This evaluation simulates the online inference latency for answering a question using different RAG approaches. All experiments were conducted on the same GPU server to ensure consistent evaluation conditions. The experi- mental results indicate that P-RAG reduces the time per question by 29% to 36% compared to Standard RAG. Notably, the Combine Both baseline, which showed the best performance and significant improvements in the main experiment, requires almost the same online computation time as the Standard RAG method. In contrast, multi-round RAG frameworks like DRAGIN and FLARE exhibit significantly higher latency for answering a question compared to single-round
