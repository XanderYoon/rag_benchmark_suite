The computation cost of our method can be divided into offline preprocessing cost and online inference cost. The offline cost primarily arises from the Parametric Docu- ment Encoding (§3.2.2). Let |𝑑 | be the average number of tokens in a document 𝑑, and ℎ be the hidden dimension size of the LLM. The computational complexity of a typical decoder-only LLM is O (|𝑑 |2ℎ + |𝑑 |ℎ2), where the attention layers complexity is O (|𝑑 |2ℎ) plus the FFN layers O (|𝑑 |ℎ2). Theoretically, our method only in- troduces a constant coefficient change on the number of tokens processed, thus the overall time complexity remainsO (|𝑑 |2ℎ+|𝑑 |ℎ2). Based on our implementation settings detailed in § 4.3, the Data Augmentation process takes the original document 𝑑 as input and subsequently generates approximately 2|𝑑 | new tokens. This pro- cess requires computational costs equivalent to a forward pass over 3|𝑑 | tokens, including the decoding of 1|𝑑 | tokens and the infer- ence of 2|𝑑 | tokens. Training LoRA parameters on these augmented tokens requires a forward pass over 3|𝑑 | tokens and a backward pass equivalent to processing 6|𝑑 | tokens (typically about twice the forward-pass cost), resulting in an overall computational cost equivalent to processing 9|𝑑 | tokens. Adding the 3|𝑑 | tokens from the Document Augmentation phase, the total computational cost is approximately the cost of decoding 12|𝑑 | tokens in the LLM. The online inference cost mainly depends on the number of in- put and output tokens. For simplicity, we focus on input tokens and ignore the variance in output tokens since they vary signifi- cantly from tasks and LLMs. Let |𝑞| represent the length of input prompt/question 𝑞, and 𝑡 be the number of retrieved documents.
