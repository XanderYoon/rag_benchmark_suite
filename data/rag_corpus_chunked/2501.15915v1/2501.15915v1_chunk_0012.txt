In this subsection, we in- troduce the second step of the offline document parameterization pipeline, where we leverage the augmented dataset 𝐷𝑖 (defined in Eq. 2) to train the parametric representation 𝑝𝑖 for each docu- ment 𝑑𝑖. Specifically, we initialize these parametric representations as low-rank matrices corresponding to the feed-forward network (FFN) parameter matrix 𝑊 of the LLM L, following the LoRA ap- proach [14]. This design allows each document 𝑑𝑖 to be associ- ated with independently trained low-rank parameters, allowing the model to internalize the knowledge specific to 𝑑𝑖 in a parameter- efficient manner.4 Suppose the Transformer layers in L have a hidden dimension ℎ, and the feed-forward network (FFN) within each layer has an intermediate dimension 𝑘. Consequently, each FFN layer of L con- tains a weight matrix𝑊 ∈ Rℎ×𝑘. To incorporate document-specific knowledge, we introduce low-rank matrices 𝐴 and 𝐵 such that 𝑊 ′ = 𝑊 + Δ𝑊 = 𝑊 + 𝐴 𝐵⊤, (3) where 𝐴 ∈ Rℎ×𝑟 and 𝐵 ∈ R𝑘 ×𝑟 , with 𝑟 ≪ min(ℎ, 𝑘). The original weight matrix 𝑊 is kept fixed, while 𝐴 and 𝐵 are the only trainable parameters for that layer. We denote these newly introduced param- eters as Δ𝜃 = {𝐴, 𝐵}. By combining the pre-trained weights 𝑊 and Δ𝜃, the model obtains the knowledge from the selected document. Each document in the corpus is associated with its instance of Δ𝜃. For each document 𝑑𝑖, we train its corresponding parametric representation Δ𝜃 using its corresponding augmented dataset 𝐷𝑖. Recall from Eq. 2 that 𝐷𝑖 contains triplets 𝑑𝑖𝑘, 𝑞𝑖 𝑗 , 𝑎𝑖 𝑗. For each triplet, we concatenate 𝑑𝑖𝑘, 𝑞𝑖 𝑗 , and 𝑎𝑖 𝑗 into a token sequence:
