of our proposed Parametric RAG pipeline. Consider an LLM (denoted as L) with base parameters 𝜃. Given a user query 𝑞, we aim to generate an accurate response using an external corpus 𝐾. Formally, the corpus 𝐾 is defined as: 𝐾 = {𝑑1, 𝑑2, . . . , 𝑑𝑁 }, where each 𝑑𝑖 represents a text chunk, such as documents, Wikipedia articles, or passages (for convenience, we refer to each 𝑑𝑖 as ‘document’ in the following sections). The system contains a retrieval module 𝑅 that calculates the relevance score of each document {𝑆𝑑1, 𝑆𝑑2, . . . , 𝑆𝑑𝑁 } corresponding to the query 𝑞. Traditional RAG paradigms select the top 𝑘 documents with the highest relevance scores as relevant external knowledge and append them to the input context of the L. This process is typically guided by a prompt template that instructs L to generate the response based on the provided knowledge. In contrast to the in-context RAG paradigm that injects relevant documents into the LLM’s input context, in Parametric RAG, we propose to insert documents directly into the parameters of L. To achieve this, the Parametric RAG framework is designed with two stages: an offline document parameterization stage and an online inference stage with a Retrieve-Update-Generate workflow. Offline document Parameterization. In this step (illustrated in Figure 2), we offline transform each document in𝐾 into a parametric representation, thereby forming a set of parameters known as the Parametric Corpus 𝐾𝑃 . Specifically, we define: 𝐾𝑃 = {𝑝𝑖 | 𝑝𝑖 = 𝑓𝜙 (𝑑𝑖 ), 𝑖 = 1, 2, . . . , 𝑁}, (1) where 𝑓𝜙 is a mapping function that converts each document 𝑑𝑖 into its corresponding parametric representation 𝑝𝑖. We define parametric representations 𝑝𝑖 to possess the following properties: (1) The parameters 𝑝𝑖 can be plugged into the
