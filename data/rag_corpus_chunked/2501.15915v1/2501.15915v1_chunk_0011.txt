robust and in- formative parametric representations for documents. Specifically, for each document, we prompt3 the LLM L to rewrite the content multiple times using different wording, styles, or organizational structures. Formally, each document𝑑𝑖 is transformed into multiple rewritten documents {𝑑𝑖 1, 𝑑𝑖 2, . . . , 𝑑𝑖𝑛 }, which preserve the orig- inal facts but vary in language expression. Once each document has been rewritten into multiple documents, we prompt L again to generate question-answer (QA) pairs based on the original docu- ment 𝑑𝑖. For each document 𝑑𝑖, L produces a set of questions and their corresponding answers: {(𝑞𝑖 1, 𝑎𝑖 1), (𝑞𝑖 2, 𝑎𝑖 2), . . . , (𝑞𝑖𝑚, 𝑎𝑖𝑚)}, where 𝑚 is a tunable hyperparameter representing the number of QA pairs we aim to generate per document. Integrating multiple rewrites with corresponding QA pairs transforms each document𝑑𝑖 into a more comprehensive resource 𝐷𝑖 that preserves its original factual content while incorporating diverse linguistic variations. Formally: 𝐷𝑖 = {(𝑑𝑖𝑘, 𝑞𝑖 𝑗 , 𝑎𝑖 𝑗 ) | 1 ≤ 𝑘 ≤ 𝑛, 1 ≤ 𝑗 ≤ 𝑚}, (2) where each (𝑑𝑖𝑘, 𝑞𝑖 𝑗 , 𝑎𝑖 𝑗 ) triple corresponds to a rewritten docu- ment 𝑑𝑖𝑘 from the original document 𝑑𝑖, coupled with a question 𝑞𝑖 𝑗 and its respective answer 𝑎𝑖 𝑗 . 2Our experimental results corroborate these conclusions, as shown in Figure 3. 3Due to space constraints, we have not included the specific prompts in the main text. However, all prompts used in this study are available at the following anonymous link: https://github.com/oneal2000/PRAG/blob/main/all_prompt.md 3.2.2 Parametric Document Encoding. In this subsection, we in- troduce the second step of the offline document parameterization pipeline, where we leverage the augmented dataset 𝐷𝑖 (defined in Eq. 2) to train the parametric representation 𝑝𝑖 for each docu- ment 𝑑𝑖. Specifically, we initialize
