. , rR}, retrieving items from R rele- vant to q can be achieved by using a base retrieval function hk base (q, R) ⊆ R that returns a ranked list of k items from R in descending order, according to a retrieval score. BM25 or a conventional dense retriever can serve as a base retrieval function, with- out requiring any multi-hop capabilities. Our goal is to retrieve relevant passages from C that enable a retrieval-augmented model to answer multi-hop queries (Lewis et al., 2020). To this end, we introduce GEAR, which is a graph-enhanced framework of retrieval agent (see Figure 1). 4 Retrieval with Synchronised Graph Expansion Given an input query q, let C′ q = hk base (q, C) be a list of passages returned by the base retriever. Given this list, C′ q, our goal is to derive relevant multi-hop contexts (passages) by retrieving a sub- graph of triples that interconnect their source pas- sages. Two challenges arise in materialising such sub-graph retrieval: (i) locating initial triples (i.e. starting nodes) Tq, and (ii) expanding the graph from these initial triples while reducing the search Figure 1: System Architecture. The left section (blue) depicts SyncGE (detailed in §4), while the the right sec- tion (orange), completes the GEAR system (described in §5). A visual step-by-step walk-through of the system is presented in Appendix C. space. The following sections address these chal- lenges within GEAR. 4.1 Knowledge Synchronisation We describe a knowledge Synchronisation (Sync) process to locate initial nodes for graph expan- sion. We first employ an LLM to read C′ q (see Appendix K.2) and summarise knowledge triples that can support answering the current query q: T′ q = read C′ q, q  . (1) T′ q is a collection of triples to which we refer as
