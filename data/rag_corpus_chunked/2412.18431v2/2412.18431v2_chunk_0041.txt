12: Retrieval performance for single- and multi-step retrievers across different triple density measurements in MuSiQue. Results are reported using R@15. Triple densities (ρt) are calculated as the average number of triples associated with the gold documents for the questions within the MuSiQue’s test set. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 Number of Iterations (n) 40 45 50 55 60 65 70R@15 GeAR Hybrid + SyncGE HippoRAG w/ IRCoT IRCoT (BM25) IRCoT (ColBERTv2) Figure 5: Evolution of R@15 over 20 iterations on MuSiQue. Recall is computed at each iteration using the cumulative set of retrieved documents, with prior recall values carried forward for questions that terminated in earlier iterations.
