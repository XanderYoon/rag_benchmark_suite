introduced additional graph stan- dardisation, including instance-to-concept linking and semantic relation completion. However, this approach heavily depends on associating triples with pre-defined concepts for logical form-based retrieval. HippoRAG leverages an alignment of passages and extracted triples to retrieve passages based on the Personalized PageRank algorithm (Gutierrez et al., 2024). While achieving improvements for single- and multi-step retrieval (when coupled with IRCoT (Trivedi et al., 2023)), it remains agnostic to the semantic relationships of extracted triples. In this paper, we leverage a similar alignment of passages and extracted triples but introduce a new graph-based retrieval framework that uses a small semantic model for exploring multi-hop relation- ships. Our framework considers the contributions of all triple elements participating in reasoning chains, offering a more robust solution for asso- ciating questions with triple reasoning chains. 3 Preliminaries Let C = {c1, c2, . . . , cC} be an index of passages and T = {t1, t2, . . . , tT : tj = (sj, pj, oj)} be an- other index representing a set of triples associated with the passages in C s.t. ∀tj ∈ T∃! ci ∈ C, where sj, pj and oj the respective subject, predi- cate and object of the j-th triple. In this setup, each triple is uniquely linked to exactly one passage, and a passage can potentially be associated with multiple triples. Given an input query q and an index of interest R = {r1, . . . , rR}, retrieving items from R rele- vant to q can be achieved by using a base retrieval function hk base (q, R) ⊆ R that returns a ranked list of k items from R in descending order, according to a retrieval score. BM25 or a conventional dense retriever can serve as a base retrieval function, with- out requiring
