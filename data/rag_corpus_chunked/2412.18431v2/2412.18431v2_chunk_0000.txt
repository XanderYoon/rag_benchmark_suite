In this paper, we introduce GEAR, a system that advances RAG performance through two key innovations: (i) an efficient graph expan- sion mechanism that augments any conven- tional base retriever, such as BM25, and (ii) an agent framework that incorporates the result- ing graph-based retrieval into a multi-step re- trieval framework. Our evaluation demon- strates GEAR’s superior retrieval capabilities across three multi-hop question answering datasets. Notably, our system achieves state- of-the-art results with improvements exceed- ing 10% on the challenging MuSiQue dataset, while consuming fewer tokens and requiring fewer iterations than existing multi-step re- trieval systems.

While effective for simple queries, multi-hop QA presents a more com- plex challenge, requiring reasoning across several passages or documents. Consider the example in Table 1, where finding the correct answer requires building a 3-hop reasoning chain starting from the question’s main entity (i.e. “Stephen Curry”). A base retriever cannot, by design, retrieve all neces- sary information in a single step. To address these complex reasoning require- ments, researchers have increasingly turned to graph-based approaches (Fang et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024; Edge et al., 2024; Gutierrez et al., 2024; †The authors contributed
