we test the performance of GEAR across different beam search length values and maximum numbers of agent iterations. For the single-step configurations (i.e. any base retriever with NaiveGE or SyncGE), we set the base retriever’s maximum number of returned chunks to match our evaluation recall threshold. With the multi-step setup, we maintain a consistent maxi- mum of 10 retrieved chunks before knowledge syn- chronisation for the purpose of matching IRCoT’s implementation. While this 10-chunk limitation applies to individual retrieval rounds, please note that the total number of accessible chunks can ex- ceed this threshold through graph expansion and multiple GEAR iterations. passageLink Details We use passageLink to link each triple tj ∈ G (n) to its corresponding pas- sages in C by running a retrieval step as follows: hk base (q, C ∪ T) = RRF  hk base (tj, C) , hk base (tj, T)  , (10) where j ∈  1, . . . ,|G(n)| and hk base (tj, C ∪ T) is the RRF of passages returned by both T and C when queried with tj. C Walkthrough Example Table 6 provides a visual step-by-step example of our framework. The example demonstrates how each component contributes to the final retrieved passages, which we hope offers useful context for understanding our design decisions.
