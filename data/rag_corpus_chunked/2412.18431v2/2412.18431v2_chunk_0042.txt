of America, I need to look for information about the current leadership of the bank. Next, I will check for the current CEO of Bank of America to answer the question accurately. What UK label was purchased by the company that, along with the distributor of The Cube, and ABC, is the other major New York-based broadcaster? ⟨CBS, purchased, Oriole Records⟩ ⟨CBS, is a major broadcaster based in, New York⟩ ⟨NBC, is a major broadcaster based in, New York⟩ ⟨The Cube, was distributed by, NBC⟩ The original network of Undercovers is NBC, which is one of the major broadcasters based in New York. Now, I need to find out which UK label was bought by NBC ...

Table 13: Comparison of MuSiQue queries where GEAR achieves 100% recall at R@15 in a single iteration, while HippoRAG w/ IRCoT shows lower performance despite using all four available iterations. Cell colors indicate recall performance: green for 100% recall, red for 0% recall, and yellow for any intermediate value. Cell values in GEAR represent the proximal triples stored in the Gist Triple Memory. Cell values in HippoRAG w/ IRCoT represent IRCoT’s thought process. demonstrate a consistent pattern across all methods: retrieval performance stabilises after approximately 4 iterations, with no substantial improvements or degradation in subsequent iterations. While some minor fluctuations occur beyond this point, they are negligible. This performance plateau can be attributed to two key factors. First, the query re-writing mech- anisms in all investigated approaches struggle to generate effective subsequent queries. Second, our analysis has identified several cases of unanswer- able queries within MuSiQue’s answerable subset. A representative example
