QA datasets: MuSiQue (Trivedi et al., 2022), HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018), and 2Wiki- MultiHopQA (2Wiki) (Ho et al., 2020). Our dataset choices closely align with the multi-hop QA tasks, and are consistent with related studies in this space (Li et al., 2024; Fang et al., 2024; Gutierrez et al., 2024; Park et al., 2024). In order to explore the generalisability of GEAR in additional scenarios, we use the hand-picked case study data2 provided by Gutierrez et al.. These include four path-finding questions across four dif- ferent domains: books, movies, universities and biomedicine. We test GEAR against HippoRAG w/ IRCoT on these cases. Table 15 displays the results. In three out of the four cases, GEAR out- performs the competition in recall, successfully identifying more relevant passages, and misses the relevant passages in only one case.
