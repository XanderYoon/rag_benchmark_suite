triples s.t. G(n) = h TG q(1) ◦ · · · ◦ TG q(n) i , (5) where ◦ defines the concatenation operation. The triple memory serves as a concise representation of all the accumulated evidence, up to the n-th step. We believe the process introduced by the read step along with the information storage paradigm served by the gist memory, aligns well with the communication between the hippocampus and neo- cortex. The combination of the two establishes the synergetic behaviour between our graph retriever and the LLM that we seek to achieve withinGEAR. 5.2 Reasoning for Termination After updating G(n), we assess whether it contains sufficient evidence to answer the original question through an LLM reasoning step: a(n), r(n) = reason(G(n), q), (6) where a(n) denotes the query’s answerability given the evidence in G(n), and r(n) represents the rele- vant reasoning. When the query is deemed answer- able, the system concludes its iterative process. 5.3 Query Re-writing The query re-writing process leverages an LLM that incorporates three key inputs: the original query q, the accumulated memory, and crucially, the reasoning output r(n) from the previous step. This process can be formally expressed as: q(n+1) = rewrite  G(n), q, r(n)  , (7) where q(n+1) represents the updated query, which serves as input for the retriever in the next iteration. 5.4 After Termination GEAR aims to return a single ranked list of pas- sages. Given the final gist memory G(n) upon ter- mination, we link each proximal triple in G(n) to a list of passages as follows: Ctj = passageLink (tj, k) , (8) where j ∈  1, . . . ,|G(n)| . Similar to tripleLink, passageLink is implemented by re- trieving passages with a triple as the query (see Appendix B.2). The final list of passages returned
