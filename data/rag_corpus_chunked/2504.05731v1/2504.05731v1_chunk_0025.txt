see that without fine-tuning based on LLM feedback, using a pre-trained dense retrieval model leads to worse performance. This indicates that retrieval cannot be based solely on semantic relevance, ensuring that the retrieved documents support personalized LLM generation is crucial. Addi- tionally, we analyzed the impact of removing 𝑆retriever 𝑢,𝑑 from Eq. (4) and only using 𝑆retriever 𝑞,𝑑 from Eq. (3) for retrieval, as indicated in row (4). The results decreased, demonstrating that users’ personal- ized preferences should also be considered during retrieval, rather SIGIR ’25, July 13–18, 2025, Padua, Italy. Teng Shi et al.

We also validated the effectiveness of the personalized reranker we designed, as shown in Table 3, rows (5) and (6). First, in row (5), it can be seen that using a pre-trained reranker leads to worse results, highlighting the importance of
