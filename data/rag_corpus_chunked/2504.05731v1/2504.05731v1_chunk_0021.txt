existing methods, CFRAG achieved the best results across six datasets in the LaMP benchmark. This demon- strates the effectiveness of introducing collaborative information between users into RAG and using LLM feedback to tune the re- triever and reranker to ensure that they can retrieve the documents that support the personalized LLM generation. • Secondly, we can observe that even randomly selecting user his- tory outperforms the zero-shot method without any user history. This highlights the importance of incorporating user history to reflect user preferences for personalized generation. Additionally, we observe that retrieval methods perform better than simply se- lecting the most recent user history, underscoring the importance of retrieval. • Thirdly, we also observe that, in most cases, RAG and ROPG meth- ods using dense retrieval models outperform BM25. Additionally, CFRAG, which fine-tunes the retriever based on LLM feedback, achieves better results. This shows, on the one hand, that the better the retriever, the better the generation results, and on the other 2https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5 3https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-reranker-base Retrieval Augmented Generation with Collaborative Filtering for Personalized Text Generation SIGIR ’25, July 13–18, 2025, Padua, Italy. Table 2: Comparison of the performance of CFRAG with other approaches on the LaMP benchmark. ↑ indicates that a higher value for the corresponding metric is better, while ↓ indicates that a lower value is better. The best and the second-best methods are highlighted in bold and underlined fonts, respectively. “*” indicates improvements over the second-best methods are statistically significant (𝑡-test, 𝑝-value< 0.05).
