Personalized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [8] has become a commonly used approach for personalizing LLMs [29, 31, 32, 57]. The process of existing personalized RAG methods typically involves retrieving similar documents from the user’s historical behaviors based on the user’s input query, then concatenating these documents with the query as a prompt input to the LLM for gen- eration. Although effective, this approach is limited to retrieving only the current user’s history, neglecting collaborative informa- tion. Users with similar histories tend to be more alike, and the information from these similar users can also aid in personaliz- ing generation for the current user. As shown in the example in Figure 1, the upper part illustrates the results of the existing RAG method, which retrieves documents from the current user’s history. We can only infer from these results that “She” in the user’s input refers to “Hillary Clinton”. In contrast, the lower part demonstrates arXiv:2504.05731v1 [cs.IR] 8 Apr 2025 SIGIR ’25, July 13–18, 2025, Padua, Italy. Teng Shi et al.
