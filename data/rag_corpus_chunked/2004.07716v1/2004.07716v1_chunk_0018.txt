Overload events require an individual’s heart to put a sustained effort. These can be identified from the heart rate stream (by finding intervals of Table 2: Data streams and sources Data stream Sources Heart rate Strava, Apple Health-Kit Power Strava Cadence Strava Altitude Strava Location Strava, Google Location History Step Count Apple Health-Kit Weight Apple Health-Kit Stairs Apple Health-Kit high heart rate) or by combining altitude stream (to detect climb events) and cycling (or running, or hiking) events. If these events are repeated over time, they are likely to result in an increase in left ventricle volume (as depicted in fig. 1). These events can be represented as V olOverload := (HR > 140) ∨ (Cyclinд∧detect −climb (Altitude )) Pressure Overload events require the heart to put in a short and intense effort, which presents as a spike in the heart rate stream. These can also be determined by using the power output stream collected during cycling events and identi- fying intervals where power output is higher than 400W. Over time, these events lead to a reduction in left ventricular volume. These events can be represented as PressOverload := detect − spike (HR ) ∨ (Power > 400W ) • Environmental interface events An individual’s expo- some streams can be created from their location history combined with publicly available GIS data provided by dif- ferent government organizations. PM2.5 intake can be com- puted from air pollutant data (provided by EPA) and the heart rate stream (used to estimate the breathing rate using results from [49]). We are estimating individual tidal volume using formulation given in [13]. Multiplying the estimated tidal volume and breathing rate gives us the total air intake per minute for the individual, using which we can find their PM2.5 intake. Prolonged PM2.5 exposure has many long- term
