and the heart rate stream (used to estimate the breathing rate using results from [49]). We are estimating individual tidal volume using formulation given in [13]. Multiplying the estimated tidal volume and breathing rate gives us the total air intake per minute for the individual, using which we can find their PM2.5 intake. Prolonged PM2.5 exposure has many long- term and short-term health effects[50]. Blood O2 level of individuals is known to decrease with alti- tude as air pressure decreases with an increase in altitude. It leads to reduced blood oxygen saturation levels, which can be quantified by using the relationship described in [18]. Low blood oxygen levels can lead to hypoxia, which can affect various biological functions [17]. 7 RESULTS 7.1 RQ1: Data fusion We can use multiple data streams from different sources to rec- ognize different instances of an interface event. This is evident in fig. 6, which depicts the occurrences of cardiovascular volume and pressure overload events. Volume overload events are detected in two ways, 1) We identify intervals with a sufficiently high heart rate, and 2) We identify intervals where the person is climbing up Figure 6: This figure shows different interface events retrieved using user-generated data. Different days of the year are rep- resented as concentric circles, and different sectors of the circle represent different times of the day. Events in a day are represented as colored arcs on that circle. Volume and pressure overload events are retrieved using lifestyle data and events such as heart rate and exercise events. We can see that we can retrieve a significantly larger number of interface events by combining events from multiple data streams. This figure also shows the environmental interface events. High PM2.5 intake events are recognized over one week. These are the instances where per minute
