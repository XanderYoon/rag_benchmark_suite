or symptoms which do not have a well-defined relationship with each other. For example, we could discover if a person is al- lergic to a particular pollutant (e.g., pollen) by correlating their exposome stream with adverse health outcomes. Causal discovery algorithms could be used to find a causal link between different lifestyle events and biological parameters[ 11]. Such causal links indicate an unknown interface event. Situations like this would need to be explored further by the experts in that particular domain. We plan to build upon the existing system and discover relation- ships between lifestyle events and biological parameters. REFERENCES [1] [n.d.].
