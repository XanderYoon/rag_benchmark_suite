and knowledge graphs, we may be able to automate this process by directly converting the insights from medical literature to events definition. The approach detailed in this paper facilitates contin- uous health state estimation and, eventually, continuous health navigation, as described in [33]. 8.1 Application: Health State Estimation We have used the event retrieval framework in conjunction with a health state estimation framework, the details of which are be- yond the scope of this work. We are trying to estimate the cardio- respiratory fitness of the user using V O2Max as an indicator. The graph depicting the causal relationship between various measured and estimated variables is depicted in fig. 9. The interface events for this estimation scheme were sleep and exercise events. We used sleep events to estimate the user’s resting heart rate and aggregated the exercise events’ duration to estimate the change in arteriove- nous oxygen difference from its base value [1]. The details for this project could be found in [32]. A nutrition guidance/recommendation system could utilize such a system to calculate an individual’s electrolyte requirements by combining their location stream with local weather to estimate their activity levels and local temperature, which in turn allows us to estimate how much sodium they lost through sweat[34]. This can be generalized to other macronutrients too. 8.2 Future Work: Knowledge Discovery We can employ knowledge discovery algorithms to find recurring patterns between interface events and changes in biological vari- ables or symptoms which do not have a well-defined relationship with each other. For example, we could discover if a person is al- lergic to a particular pollutant (e.g., pollen) by correlating their exposome stream with adverse health outcomes. Causal discovery algorithms could be used to find a causal link between different lifestyle events and biological parameters[ 11]. Such causal links
