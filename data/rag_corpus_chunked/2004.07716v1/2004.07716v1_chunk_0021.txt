These events are, by definition, short, and the same can also be seen in fig 6. We can also combine the user-generated data with environmental data to generate their exposome streams. Figure 6 shows the occurrences of PM2.5 intake events over a week, and low blood oxygen events over a year. 7.2 RQ2: Continuous Retrieval We are retrieving the events continuously over a year, as shown in figure 8. A zoomed-in view is shown in figures 3 and 4 which high- light the combinations of events while retrieving an interface event. We apply event detection operators on incoming data streams and use the definition of the interface events to combine the generated events. Once we have retrieved the interface events over a suffi- ciently long period, we can analyze their occurrences and try to find useful patterns, such as relationship of volume overload events with circadian patterns. We can see in fig. 6, the density of the volume overload events is very low after sunset, which may lead us to think that any disruptions in sleep patterns are unlikely to be caused by these events. We can overlay a similar plot of sleep events on this plot and see if there is any relationship between the event streams. 7.3 RQ3: Real world query The system is also useful for answering a real-world query about a person’s life in terms of attributes and patterns of relevant interface events. One such example is in fig. 7 where we try to respond to a physician’s questions about a person’s exercise habits. Typically a doctor would ask the person about the frequency and intensity of their exercise routine. These answers are in figure 7, where we display the exercise frequency and total duration of exercise events for every week of the year. We also
