data objects for the data streams and event streams, the adapters pass these objects to a database connector object which handles the I/O operations in the database. This data model allows us to create a new data stream by combining data from multiple sources, thus providing a less sparse data source for events. Data from different sources can also be combined to provide a more accurate estimate of the underlying value. We can also enrich existing events by using aggregated data streams. 5.2 Event Operators and Transformations All event operators and transformation are implemented as func- tions that process a data stream or event stream, where event op- erators requiring more than one stream accept those as additional inputs. The different transformations are in different modules, and the appropriate module is selected based on the interface event definition provided. The transformation functions can create a new data stream or a new event stream that can then be passed to the database connector for storing in the events log or data stream storage. Thus once a new stream has been created, it can be used like any other event or data stream for creating further events. We expect this system to be used for estimating different biological variables in different contexts. The estimation framework should be able to query the system for relevant interface events. For ex- ample, if we are trying to estimate the cardiovascular health of an individual, the researcher or the user should be able to specify the interface events using the event pattern language. The estimation framework can trigger the interface events retrieval by querying for those, or it can be made continuous by adding appropriate triggers whenever a new event is added to the events log. 6 METHODOLOGY In this paper, we present a system for
