data stream (e.g., binning heart rate in different ranges) to recognizing events and actions from a video stream (e.g., fall detection). We currently use a subset of the event pattern language proposed in [21] to describe the interface events. We have implemented a subset of the event operators described in [ 21] specifically NOT (¬) , AND(∧), OR(∨) and DELAY(δ) operators, which can be used in conjunction with user-defined event detection operators to de- scribe complex events. For example, if we want to identify events where the heart rate of the individual is above 120 bpm, and PM2.5 concentration is above 10µg/m3 of air, then we would need first to create a PM2.5 stream using their location stream. We could then define these exposure events using the formulation given below. Figure 4 shows some of the retrieved events. ExposureEvent := (Heartrate > 120) ∧ (PM 2.5 > 10) These event operators could be combined with user-defined event recognition operators allowing us to utilize more data streams and recognize more complicated events. For example, we define a climb-detection operator for the altitude data stream. This operator detects time intervals when the user is climbing up a slope. The detected events could be combined with cycling events and events where the person’s heart rate is above 170 to find out high-intensity uphill cycling events, which cause cardiovascular volume overload. The event formulation is shown below, and some of the retrieved events are shown in figure 3 U phillCycle := Cyclinд∧ detect − climb (Altitude ) Figure 3: This figure shows the application of AND operator to combine events. We are trying to detect interface events where the heart rate of the individual is in zone 4 (170-190 bpm) while they are climbing a slope on a bicycle. Figure 4: This figure depicts
