We plan to instantiate the system for multiple users in future projects. There are two primary sources of personal data that we have utilized in our experiments: • Detailed physiological data generated during an exercise event sampled at per second frequency. These data streams and events are collected from Strava and can provide a greater understanding of the user’s health state. • Lifestyle data collected as events or data streams during the course of the day. These are typically sampled at a lower frequency. These data streams and events are collected from various sources such as Apple HealthKit and Google timeline etc. These capture the lifestyle events that we expect to encounter during our day-to-day lives such as sleep, meal times, and commute. These data streams and corresponding sources are listed in table 2. We have also used the pollution data captured by various environ- mental agencies across the world and aggregated by EPA. The data files can be found at [5]. We find the monitoring station nearest to the user’s location and use the file generated by the station at the given time to estimate the user’s exposure to different pollutants. 6.2 Interface Events We have defined interface events derived from biomedical literature using the previously mentioned event operators and specific event- detection operators for data streams. We are retrieving two lifestyle based interface events and two environmental interface events which are described below. • Lifestyle interface events Volume Overload events require an individual’s heart to put a sustained effort. These can be identified from the heart rate stream (by finding intervals of Table 2: Data streams and sources Data stream Sources Heart rate Strava, Apple Health-Kit Power Strava Cadence Strava Altitude Strava Location Strava, Google Location History Step Count Apple Health-Kit Weight Apple Health-Kit Stairs Apple Health-Kit high
