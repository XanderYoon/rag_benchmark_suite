events are retrieved using lifestyle data and events such as heart rate and exercise events. We can see that we can retrieve a significantly larger number of interface events by combining events from multiple data streams. This figure also shows the environmental interface events. High PM2.5 intake events are recognized over one week. These are the instances where per minute PM2.5 intake was higher than 0.7 µg. Low blood oxygen events are recognized over one year, where blood oxygen saturation goes below 95%. The highlighted sectors roughly represent the time between sunrise and sunset; thus, we can see how different events overlap with circadian patterns. Figure 7: This figure shows the results of a real-world query about exercise behavior. The bar plots show the exercise fre- quency and exercise minutes per week over a year. The polar plot shows all the exercise events during the day, where the highlighted sector roughly matches the time between sun- set and sunrise. Thus we can see how likely are these events to cause any disruptions in circadian patterns. a slope under their power (e.g., cycling). These two event defini- tions are combined using an OR operator to give all occurrences of volume overload events. We could add more methods of rec- ognizing volume overload events using the same operator with minimal additional effort. Similarly, pressure overload events are being recognized from heart rate data stream (spike detection) and power stream (high effort intervals). These events are, by definition, short, and the same can also be seen in fig 6. We can also combine the user-generated data with environmental data to generate their exposome streams. Figure 6 shows the occurrences of PM2.5 intake events over a week, and low blood oxygen events over a year. 7.2 RQ2: Continuous Retrieval We are retrieving the events
