have a vastly different impact on our heart, and it is important that we find the cardiovascular volume and pressure overload events if we want to find the impact of any exercise on our heart. Another simple example of an interface event would be an acute stress response from the body. This could be caused by a public speaking situation, fear of a threat, an overload of work at the office, or an emotional situation. All these events are quite varied, yet a primary influence on the physical biology will be through the stress response of releasing cortisol into the bloodstream and an increase in blood pressure [25]. In our work, we demonstrate a system that allows us to aggregate data from different sources to enrich an existing event or create new interface events. We can find lifestyle events that cause changes in health by finding the interface events associated with lifestyle events. We are trying to answer the following research questions (RQ) in this work: • RQ1. How can we use different sources to identify a specific interface event? • RQ2. How can we retrieve an interface event continuously over time using its definition? • RQ3. How can we convert a real-world query to relevant interface events and identify the required attributes and patterns? 2 RELATED WORKS 2.1 Daily Events Aggregation: Lifelogs Aggregating and recognizing events in our daily lives is a pop- ular problem in the multimedia community. This problem has been termed "Lifelogging", which is explained as "a phenomenon whereby people can digitally record their own daily lives in varying amounts of detail, for a variety of purposes"[16]. Lifelogging is the first step towards recognizing various daily activities and how they define user’s behavior. Lifelogging applications collect a variety of data streams about an individual, which has
