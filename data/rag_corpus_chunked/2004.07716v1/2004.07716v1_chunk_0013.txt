shown in figure 3 U phillCycle := Cyclinд∧ detect − climb (Altitude ) Figure 3: This figure shows the application of AND operator to combine events. We are trying to detect interface events where the heart rate of the individual is in zone 4 (170-190 bpm) while they are climbing a slope on a bicycle. Figure 4: This figure depicts the instances during a day where the individual’s PM2.5 intake is expected to be high. This is determined by combining heart rate zone events (HR > 120) with High PM2.5 concentration events, which in turn is determined using location stream and air pollution data. Table 1: Available sample schema for Data and event streams. Source adapters can choose a schema for different data streams being generated from that source. All events need to follow the event schema specified below. Different event attributes can be stored under the parameters field. Stream Field name Data type Event Event type String Event name String Start time Timestamp End time Timestamp Parameters Key-Value pairs Data streams Set Real valued Data Stream Timestamp Timestamp Value Numeric Unit String Source String Location Data Stream Timestamp Timestamp Value Location Unit String Source String Figure 5: This figure shows a high level description of the system, starting from different data sources controlled by the user. These sources pass their data to the respective data adapters which convert the data to a unified schema. This schema is followed in the events log and the data stream store. The knowledge layer consists of definition of various complex events which are derived from measured events and data streams. 5 SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE As discussed in previous sections, there are two primary compo- nents of this system, and we will discuss their architecture sepa- rately. Event aggregation and knowledge-driven retrieval are very loosely
