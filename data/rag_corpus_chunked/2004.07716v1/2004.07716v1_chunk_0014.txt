the events log and the data stream store. The knowledge layer consists of definition of various complex events which are derived from measured events and data streams. 5 SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE As discussed in previous sections, there are two primary compo- nents of this system, and we will discuss their architecture sepa- rately. Event aggregation and knowledge-driven retrieval are very loosely coupled in this work so that the event retrieval framework could be used on different platforms, which need not follow the same data model. Figure 5 depicts a high-level architecture of the whole system and illustrates the flow of data between different components. 5.1 Event Aggregation Different data sources have their schema and modalities; thus, it is essential to have a separate parser for each source, which con- verts the incoming data to a uniform format and adds a reference to corresponding data streams for each event. The output of the adapters is different events measured by these systems and the associated data streams. All the adapters’ output must follow one of the schemas depicted in table 1. The events log table contains, and each data stream has its table in the relational database. All data adapters have the same basic framework. They access a source-relation mapping to identify corresponding relations for every data stream and, if needed, create a new table for the data stream by picking one of the available schema (Fig. 5). After creat- ing different relational data objects for the data streams and event streams, the adapters pass these objects to a database connector object which handles the I/O operations in the database. This data model allows us to create a new data stream by combining data from multiple sources, thus providing a less sparse data source for events. Data from different sources can also be
