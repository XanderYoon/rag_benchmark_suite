useful in studying underlying causes of different diseases and assessing disease risk factors[29][42][10]. There are IoT devices that can cap- ture air quality and particulate matter concentration even when we are indoors, thus making our exposome even more accurate[4]. These user-generated data and event streams can be used to iden- tify recurring user habits and lifestyle choices which impact their health in the long and short term. The importance of multimodal health tracking and estimation systems is even more apparent in the current context of the widespread pandemic of COVID-19. There are ongoing research studies to build early-diagnosis systems for COVID-19 using multimodal data collected from a variety of wear- able devices [2][6]. Such systems can have an immense impact in our fight against this pandemic by diagnosing individuals before they become symptomatic and significantly reducing the commu- nity spread of the disease. While these devices do capture a large amount of data about events happening in our lives, they typically stay in their silos. It is necessary to combine all such events and data streams to enable multimodal applications to perform effective health estimation and guidance. We may want to combine events or data streams from different sources to identify more complex events that have a de- terministic relationship with health parameters. Such events act as an interface between lifestyle events and biological systems; hence arXiv:2004.07716v1 [cs.HC] 16 Apr 2020 Figure 1: This figure shows that detecting relevant interface events is necessary to estimate the physiological state of an individual from their lifelog information. Here two exam- ples of life events are given that cause opposite outcomes in cardiac adaptation. Both events at a crude level can be con- sidered exercise, but precisely extracting the interface event is critical if we are to use the lifelog information to estimate
