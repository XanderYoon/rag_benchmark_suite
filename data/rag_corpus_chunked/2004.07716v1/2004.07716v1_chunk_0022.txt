is in fig. 7 where we try to respond to a physician’s questions about a person’s exercise habits. Typically a doctor would ask the person about the frequency and intensity of their exercise routine. These answers are in figure 7, where we display the exercise frequency and total duration of exercise events for every week of the year. We also show all the exercise Figure 8: This figure shows the continuous retrieval of vol- ume overload and hypoxia events over the course of a year. (cycling) events in a format that can be compared with any other lifestyle habit (e.g., sleep) to facilitate the discovery of new behav- ioral/physiological patterns. Figure 9: This figure shows the relationship between differ- ent variables required for estimating VO2 Max from daily life data and event streams. The highlighted nodes refer to interface events or data streams created from interface events. 8 CONCLUSION In this paper, we propose an approach for specifying and retrieving health events, which we call interface events, using the domain knowledge from biomedical literature. As we showed, using multi- ple data streams in a knowledge-driven manner allows us to lever- age the available medical literature and also leaves the possibility of adding new data streams and information sources in the future. One drawback of this approach is the effort needed to convert the existing knowledge into event operator language. However, we believe that with the advances in natural language processing and knowledge graphs, we may be able to automate this process by directly converting the insights from medical literature to events definition. The approach detailed in this paper facilitates contin- uous health state estimation and, eventually, continuous health navigation, as described in [33]. 8.1 Application: Health State Estimation We have used the event retrieval framework in conjunction with a health
