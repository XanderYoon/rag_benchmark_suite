exer- cise and sleeping habit variations can cause circadian disrup- tions. 4 KNOWLEDGE DRIVEN EVENT RETRIEV AL Various events in our daily lives have a direct long-term and short- term impact on our health. Every time we eat, sleep, or walk up a set of stairs, our health state changes imperceptibly. Over time, these changes accumulate and may present themselves as chronic diseases. In order to provide health navigation for individuals[33], we need to recognize all such events that are relevant for deter- mining a user’s health state. We have adopted a knowledge-driven approach to recognize and retrieve those events. We are calling these interface events as these act as an interface between daily events and biological systems. A lot of these interface events have been recognized in the medi- cal literature. For example, PM2.5 exposure and circadian rhythm disruption are caused by different lifestyle events such as outdoor exercises, changes in sleeping and eating habits, and screen activity and impact the functioning of various biological systems (Figure 2). Similarly, links between diet and various chronic diseases such as type II diabetes, hypertension, and ASCVD has been well estab- lished in the literature. Thus, we must utilize the existing knowledge to guide the retrieval of these interface events from user-generated data. The interface events can be specified as transformations and combi- nations of existing events and data streams. These transformations can be as varied as applying a threshold on a data stream (e.g., binning heart rate in different ranges) to recognizing events and actions from a video stream (e.g., fall detection). We currently use a subset of the event pattern language proposed in [21] to describe the interface events. We have implemented a subset of the event operators described in [ 21] specifically NOT (¬) , AND(∧), OR(∨) and DELAY(δ)
