This problem has been termed "Lifelogging", which is explained as "a phenomenon whereby people can digitally record their own daily lives in varying amounts of detail, for a variety of purposes"[16]. Lifelogging is the first step towards recognizing various daily activities and how they define user’s behavior. Lifelogging applications collect a variety of data streams about an individual, which has the potential to offer unique insights into human behavior. There are many visual lifelogging applications and projects which aim to understand the user’s life and activities by using the images taken by a wearable camera (E.g., GoPro) over a long period and the data collected could be used to identify events and daily activities happening in user’s life for varied purposes[47][15][14][46]. The daily activity recognition could be further enhanced by merging the visual log with other multi-sensory data that can be collected using smartphones, wearable devices, and different IoT systems [7]. Some applications attempt to accomplish this task without using the visual logs to make the logging process more unobtrusive[37]. 2.2 Event retrieval frameworks People tend to view their time and experiences as different events that occurred in their lives. Even when we do remember an event from our lives, rarely do we remember the experiential information associated with it. Thus events provide a very natural abstraction over the underlying data streams generated by various systems and are easily understood by people. They also provide a very convenient mechanism to understand the behavior of a system even though the nature of the underlying data streams may change. With the rising popularity of smartphones, cameras, wearable devices, and IoT sensors, people are generating a humongous volume of data. Thus event recognition and retrieval are critical to utilize and manage the growing volume of data effectively. 2.2.1 Data-driven retrieval. A large amount
