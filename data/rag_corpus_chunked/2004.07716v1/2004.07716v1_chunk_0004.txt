events is necessary to estimate the physiological state of an individual from their lifelog information. Here two exam- ples of life events are given that cause opposite outcomes in cardiac adaptation. Both events at a crude level can be con- sidered exercise, but precisely extracting the interface event is critical if we are to use the lifelog information to estimate evolving health states. we are calling them interface events. These events determine the mechanism through which lifestyle events impact our biology, and variations in these interface events could lead to entirely different outcomes for similar lifestyle events. This can be observed when considering the long-term cardiac effects of different types of physical activities. Physical activities can strain our heart muscles in two ways, cardiovascular volume overload and pressure overload. Cardiovascular volume overload is a biological event where the heart is required to pump large volumes of blood through the circulatory system. This event would cause structural changes in the heart in the form of eccentric hypertrophy, where the left ventricular chamber volume increases. The volume overload interface event could be caused by a variety of exercise events such as cycling, jogging, soccer, dance, or hiking. Other exercise events such as weight lifting, sprinting, bouldering or even bowel constipation would cause pressure overload in the heart. These events would cause concentric hypertrophy of the heart[31][28][12]. This is illustrated in Figure 1. In this case, we see that similar lifestyle events can have a vastly different impact on our heart, and it is important that we find the cardiovascular volume and pressure overload events if we want to find the impact of any exercise on our heart. Another simple example of an interface event would be an acute stress response from the body. This could be caused by a public speaking situation,
