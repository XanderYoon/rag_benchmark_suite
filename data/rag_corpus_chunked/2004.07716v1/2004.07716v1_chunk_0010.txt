data in one log for the individual, which can then be utilized to identify their habits and how those impact the user’s life. Building the Personal Event Chronicle is an active research topic, and many researchers are working on systems to recognize and combine daily life events from different sources and sensors in an unobtrusive manner. [37] describes a system that utilizes a smartphone to collect various data streams and segment an individual’s day into widely recognized life events [23]. In this work, we propose to use any such system which recognizes a subset of life events and aggregate the output of those systems to recognize events that directly impact user’s health in one or more ways. We view every system as a source for a stream of events, and each event may also have a set of data streams associated with it, which provide additional information about the event. For example, a running event captured using a wearable device may have been recognized using the corresponding accelerometer data and has associated heart rate and GPS position streams, which provide in- formation about the event such as calories burned, altitude change, and average pace during the event. Figure 2: PM2.5 exposure has been linked with heart failure and death [41][43][24]. Regularly sleeping and eating at ab- normal circadian times is associated with increased risk for obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease[40]. Lifestyle events such as time zone changes, light exposure, and exer- cise and sleeping habit variations can cause circadian disrup- tions. 4 KNOWLEDGE DRIVEN EVENT RETRIEV AL Various events in our daily lives have a direct long-term and short- term impact on our health. Every time we eat, sleep, or walk up a set of stairs, our health state changes imperceptibly. Over time, these changes accumulate and may present themselves
