that have persisted for years. These events slowly change people’s health to an irreversible state, without symptomatic warning. The most widely spread dis- ease burden in the world is cardiovascular disease, and factors that change our cardiovascular health state act without any perceivable signals [30][8]. While there are tests available to measure a person’s risk for chronic diseases, they are usually performed episodically and only in a clinical setting. In the example of cardiovascular dis- ease, the invasive test of choice would be an angiogram [44]. Since these tests are so invasive, they cannot be performed frequently enough to have a constant understanding of the health of an indi- vidual. This highlights the need for using unobtrusively collected lifestyle data for estimating individual health parameters [35]. With the rising popularity of wearable, mobile, and IoT devices in all aspects of life, individuals are generating more lifelog data than ever before in human history. These sensors are capable of tracking our life the whole day, every day. Lifelogging systems do precisely this [37], and track events related to a person’s actions (such as exercise or food consumed), or their physical environment (such as exposure to smoke from a fire). Capturing all such events and data streams allows us to enhance the quality of continuous health monitoring systems. Our location history throughout the day can be combined with publicly available pollution and environmental data for computing our exposome, which has been found useful in studying underlying causes of different diseases and assessing disease risk factors[29][42][10]. There are IoT devices that can cap- ture air quality and particulate matter concentration even when we are indoors, thus making our exposome even more accurate[4]. These user-generated data and event streams can be used to iden- tify recurring user habits and lifestyle choices which impact their
