The second step is using these features to train a classifier. This makes the system "static" as it uses only the local temporal features. With recent developments in deep learning, Recurrent Neural Networks have gained popularity for recognizing events in any stream of data and also allow us to consider an extended range of temporal information [48]. [22] and [39] attempt to recognize events in multi- person videos in a sports setting (soccer and basketball, respectively) using RNNs. 2.2.2 Knowledge-driven retrieval. In many problems, there exists an underlying syntactic or semantic structure in data streams. This is especially true for natural language processing, where the data follows the grammatical rules of the language. Knowledge-driven retrieval is appropriate in such situations, where we know the composition of events in terms of other events or patterns observed in data streams. This kind of structure allows us to specify the events as patterns of other events or patterns in data streams. This has been demonstrated in [19], [36]. [19] utilizes lexico-syntactic patterns related to an event to identify and extract the sentences about the event from web search results. These sentences are then used to build a commonsense knowledge base about the event. [20] describes a lexico-semantic pattern language to extract event relationships from a text, which is then later used to learn ontology instances from the text that help domain experts with ontology population process. In all of these instances, a pattern description language is used to encode the domain-knowledge sourced rules to parse the incoming data and retrieve the events from text data. We have adopted a similar approach in multimodal streams, where an event pattern language is used to define complex events using directly measured events or events recognized from a subset of data streams, and the patterns described by
