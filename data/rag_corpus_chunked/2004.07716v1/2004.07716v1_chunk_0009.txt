description language is used to encode the domain-knowledge sourced rules to parse the incoming data and retrieve the events from text data. We have adopted a similar approach in multimodal streams, where an event pattern language is used to define complex events using directly measured events or events recognized from a subset of data streams, and the patterns described by these rules are obtained from medical literature. 3 EVENTS AGGREGATION FRAMEWORK There are various publicly available applications and devices that capture and measure different user activities. We can track our sleep events and measure sleep quality using wearable devices (e.g., FitBit, Garmin, Apple Watch) or smartphone applications (e.g., Sleep Cycle). We have applications like MyFitnessPal that allow us to create a log of our meals, along with the nutritional content of the food items. There are applications to track workouts and athletic activities that collect data at a higher resolution than daily life activities (e.g., Strava, Training Peaks) and measure our performance metrics for those activities in addition to physiological parameters such as heart rate. Many of these applications collect data without user intervention, which is one of the reasons for the widespread adoption of such systems and allows us to build future applications on top. Aggregation of events and data of different modalities and from different sources is necessary to fully utilize different ubiquitous systems tracking and measuring different aspects of our lives[38]. We have to combine the incoming data in one log for the individual, which can then be utilized to identify their habits and how those impact the user’s life. Building the Personal Event Chronicle is an active research topic, and many researchers are working on systems to recognize and combine daily life events from different sources and sensors in an unobtrusive manner.
