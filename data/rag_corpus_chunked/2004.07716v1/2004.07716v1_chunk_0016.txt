researcher or the user should be able to specify the interface events using the event pattern language. The estimation framework can trigger the interface events retrieval by querying for those, or it can be made continuous by adding appropriate triggers whenever a new event is added to the events log. 6 METHODOLOGY In this paper, we present a system for retrieving interface events from multimodal data and event streams. We obtain the defini- tion for different such events from medical literature and identify lifestyle events that could be utilized to retrieve those. For example, exposure to different pollutants is an important interface event which impacts different aspects of a person’s health. We can calcu- late the pollutant exposure from the user’s continuous GPS location stream and combining it with publicly available pollutant informa- tion provided by EPA [3]. Once the interface events have been defined, we can use the def- inition to retrieve those events and then utilize them for further estimation or guidance. 6.1 Dataset We have used lifestyle and physiological data streams collected by an individual over ten years for our experiments. Different data streams have been collected over different periods and vary in the sampling frequency. We expect our system to be used for experi- ments in an N-of-1 setting [27] for providing individualized health guidance using observational data; thus, the evaluation of this sys- tem should be done for an individual over a period of time. We plan to instantiate the system for multiple users in future projects. There are two primary sources of personal data that we have utilized in our experiments: • Detailed physiological data generated during an exercise event sampled at per second frequency. These data streams and events are collected from Strava and can provide a greater understanding of the user’s health
