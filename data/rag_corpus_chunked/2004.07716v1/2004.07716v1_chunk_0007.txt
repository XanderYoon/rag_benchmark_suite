understand the behavior of a system even though the nature of the underlying data streams may change. With the rising popularity of smartphones, cameras, wearable devices, and IoT sensors, people are generating a humongous volume of data. Thus event recognition and retrieval are critical to utilize and manage the growing volume of data effectively. 2.2.1 Data-driven retrieval. A large amount of data on the web is unstructured (E.g., Images, Videos) when it comes to extracting semantic value from it. Data-driven retrieval is appropriate in such situations, where a large volume of data is available, but the exact relationship between available data and the events is not well- defined or structured. It is especially the case for event retrieval from image, video, or audio streams. We would typically see data- driven multimodal event recognition and retrieval in surveillance systems where we want to recognize a set of predefined events from multimodal data streams (audio and video), and there is a large amount of tagged data available for training machine learning models. [9] defines a multi-level feature extraction and training methodology to detect events from audio streams. [45] describes a system to recognize scream and gunshot events from audio streams. [26] describes a system to utilize multiple modalities to detect and retrieve an event. A lot of these multimedia event detection systems adopt a two-level process, first is feature generation at a clip level that is in-turn generated by aggregating frame-level features. The second step is using these features to train a classifier. This makes the system "static" as it uses only the local temporal features. With recent developments in deep learning, Recurrent Neural Networks have gained popularity for recognizing events in any stream of data and also allow us to consider an extended range of temporal information [48].
