These events slowly change people’s health to an irreversible state, without symptomatic warning. The most widely spread dis- ease burden in the world is cardiovascular disease, and factors that change our cardiovascular health state act without any perceivable signals [30][8]. While there are tests available to measure a person’s risk for chronic diseases, they are
