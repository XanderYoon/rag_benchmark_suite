the platform, they are encour- aged to complete various training courses to enhance their tutoring skills. Given the wide range of courses available, new tutors may feel overwhelmed when deciding where to begin their learning journey. In such scenarios, they may ask general questions such as, “What can I learn today since I am a new tutor onboarding to this platform? ” They do not have prior course completions or specific learning pref- erences logged in the system, making it challenging for the recommendation system to personalize suggestions based on historical data. When prompted with“ I am a new user ”, the traditional recommender system failed to generate a recom- mendation because its algorithm relies on the cosine simi- larity of the descriptive texts of the user’s desired learning topic and the database items, and there are no courses with similar title or description as the phrase ‘ new user ’. In con- trast, both our standard LLM and the RAG-enhanced LLM system can provide relevant course suggestions for the new user, with the LLM offering more detailed descriptions based on its internal knowledge base and RAG offering more cus- tomized outputs based on its external knowledge base and the prompt template we designed. The comparative results for both the standard and RAG-based recommender systems are displayed in Figure 3. Regarding system performance, the traditional system typi- cally took about 0.02 seconds longer than RAMO to gener- ate responses according to the same user interest—a certain topic the user wants to learn, and this delay increased with the complexity of the user’s input regarding relevant skills. 4.2 LLM vs. LLM with RAG To explore how well our LLMs can provide personalized course recommendations, we used prompts that specified a 2https://www.kaggle.com/code/sagarbapodara/ coursera-course-recommendation-system-webapp particular skill to be learned. The non-RAG LLM (based
