MOOCs platforms. In response to address the limitations of prior work in recom- mendation systems, where the recommendations lack suffi- cient personalization and interaction with users, researchers have proposed integrating large language models (LLMs) into course recommendations [18]. This approach enhances recommendation accuracy and personalization by leverag- ing user history and conversational prompts. Recent frame- works like GPT4Rec [21] and Chat-Rec [9] demonstrated the potential of LLMs in improving course alignment with learn- ers’ interests and interaction. However, LLMs can some- times generate misleading or outdated information. To coun- teract these shortcomings, one possible solution is the in- tegration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLMs [26]. RAG [10] is a process that optimizes the output of LLMs by extending their robust capabilities to cater specifically to distinct domains or an organization’s internal knowledge base, eliminating the need for retraining the model [8]. The use of RAG in recommendation systems enhances the adapt- ability of LLMs, ensuring that recommendations remain cur- arXiv:2407.04925v1 [cs.IR] 6 Jul 2024 Figure 1: Interface of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation for MOOCs (RAMO) system rent and contextually relevant [26]. This advancement paves the way for more precise and targeted course recommen- dations that adapt to changes in educational content and learner preferences. Despite these improvements, there is a noticeable gap in research specifically focused on using LLMs in course recommender systems, particularly in ad- dressing the “cold start ” problem where the system lacks a user’s profile. Thus, our study aims to investigate the poten- tial of LLMs, particularly those enhanced by RAG, in pro- viding course recommendations tailored to individual user needs. We introduce a course recommender system, RAMO (Retrieval-Augmented Generation for MOOCs), which em- ploys a RAG-based LLM model (refer to Figure 1). RAMO leverages RAG’s advantage to improve the quality of course recommendations, addressing and
