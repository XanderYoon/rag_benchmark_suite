our study aims to investigate the poten- tial of LLMs, particularly those enhanced by RAG, in pro- viding course recommendations tailored to individual user needs. We introduce a course recommender system, RAMO (Retrieval-Augmented Generation for MOOCs), which em- ploys a RAG-based LLM model (refer to Figure 1). RAMO leverages RAG’s advantage to improve the quality of course recommendations, addressing and mitigating common issues associated with LLMs especially in “ cold start ” problem. 2. RELA TED WORKS 2.1 Course Recommender Systems Course recommender systems are essential in educational technology, helping students choose courses that align with their interests and academic goals. Many prior studies have employed collaborative filtering methods to build course rec- ommender systems [2, 31, 19]. For instance, Schafer et al. [31] proposed a recommender system that suggested courses based on the preferences of similar users. A more recent ex- ample by Koren et al. [19] developed advanced collaborative filtering techniques to enhance course recommendation accu- racy. However, a significant issue arises when recommending courses for new users, as there is no historical data available for these individuals—this is known as the “cold start” prob- lem [35]. To address this challenge, a recent study by Wu et al. [35] leveraged large language models (LLMs), which utilize extensive pre-trained knowledge from web datasets, demonstrating potential in overcoming the cold start prob- lem. Despite the advancements in LLMs, their integration into course recommendation systems remains largely unex- plored, presenting an opportunity for future research to in- novate and improve student course selection processes. 2.2 Large Language Models in Education Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, trained on extensive datasets, have the ability to generate human-like text and respond to questions with exceptional precision [12, 36]. Many studies have highlighted the potential of LLMs in educational applications, leveraging their capabilities to
