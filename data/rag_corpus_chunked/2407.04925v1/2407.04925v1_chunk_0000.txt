RAMO: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Enhancing MOOCs Recommendations ∗ Jiarui Rao Carnegie Mellon University 5000 Forbes Ave Pittsburgh, P A 15213 jiaruira@andrew.cmu.edu Jionghao Lin Carnegie Mellon University 5000 Forbes Ave Pittsburgh, P A 15213 jionghal@andrew.cmu.edu ABSTRACT Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have significantly enhanced educational accessibility by offering a wide vari- ety of courses and breaking down traditional barriers re- lated to geography, finance, and time. However, students of- ten face difficulties navigating the vast selection of courses, especially when exploring new fields of study. Driven by this challenge, researchers have been exploring course rec- ommender systems to offer tailored guidance that aligns with individual learning preferences and career aspirations. These systems face particular challenges in effectively ad- dressing the “cold start” problem for new users. Recent advancements in recommender systems suggest integrating large language models (LLMs) into the recommendation pro- cess to enhance personalized recommendations and address the “cold start” problem. Motivated by these advancements, our study introduces RAMO (Retrieval-Augmented Genera- tion for MOOCs), a system specifically designed to overcome the“cold start”challenges of traditional course recommender systems. The RAMO system leverages the capabilities of LLMs, along with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)- facilitated contextual understanding, to provide course rec- ommendations through a conversational interface, aiming to enhance the e-learning experience.
