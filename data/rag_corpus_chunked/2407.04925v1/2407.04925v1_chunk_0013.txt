like “I want to learn python, can you recommend me some courses?”, RAMO can give the output to the user: “ Sure! Here are some recommended Python courses for you: 1. In- troduction to Python 2. Crash Course on Python 3. First Python Program 4. Python Basics These courses cover a range of topics from basic syntax to building interactive ap- plications. Happy learning! ” When the user changes their mind and decides to learn about another topic, RAMO can give relevant recommendations. The outputs consistently matched the user requirements in relevance, successfully re- trieving the pertinent courses from the Coursera dataset, more examples could be found at Figure 5. Figure 5: User questions and related outputs Figure 6: Prompt templates and related outputs We also utilized different retrieval prompt templates to ex- plore how the output varies based on different prompts. Specifically, we used the same user question “I want to learn python”, and altered the prompt templates to specify the number of recommended courses and the level of detail pro- vided in the output, ranging from mere course titles to com- prehensive descriptions that include titles, URLs, and ra- tionales for each recommendation. The variations in the prompt templates and their corresponding outputs are il- lustrated in Figure 6. Here, red lines highlight changes in the number of courses recommended, blue lines detail the content of the courses—such as the inclusion of reasons for recommendations or just the course titles, ratings, and URLs—while green highlights how we addressed the “ cold- start” problem, resulting in recommendations of the three most popular (based on course ratings) and easiest courses (based on its difficulty level), as depicted in the output mod- ule labeled 1 in Figure 6. The generated response in re- sponse to varied prompts underscores the system’s robust-
