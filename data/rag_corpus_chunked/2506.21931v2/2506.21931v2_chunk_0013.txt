Electronics (14.4% improvement in NDCG@5) and Home (8.9%). These results confirm the importance of user preference summarization for enhancing context relevance beyond static embedding-based retrieval. Introducing the Context Summary Agent further boosts per- formance, especially in the Clothing domain (28.8% NDCG@5 im- provement), suggesting that item-level contextual understanding is critical in categories where compatibility and style matter. The com- plete Agentic RAG system, incorporating all components, achieves the best results, with up to 14% additional gains in NDCG@5 for Clothing. This confirms that semantic reasoning via natural lan- guage inference effectively bridges the gap between user intent and candidate item representation. Together, the agents provide complementary value, enabling state-of-the-art performance in conversational recommendation. 4 Conclusion ARAG reframes retrieval-augmented recommendation as a coor- dinated reasoning task among four specialized LLM agents. By separating the concerns of user understanding, semantic align- ment, context synthesis, and ranking, the framework converts a coarse embedding-based recall set into a finely filtered, semanti- cally grounded candidate list that directly reflects both long-term preferences and session intent. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show that this agentic decomposition yields substan- tial accuracy gains while simultaneously providing transparent ra- tionales that enhance interpretability and user trust. These results demonstrate that agent-oriented orchestration inside the RAG loop is an effective, practical route to highly personalized, context-aware recommendation.
