(3) Final Ranking. The Item-Ranker Agent (IRA) consumes { muser, mctx } and generates a ranked list 𝜋 together with an explanation trace. The above steps provide a multi-agent, reasoning-oriented ap- proach that refines an initial set of retrieved items into a contextu- ally aligned recommendation list. By delegating specialized tasks (e.g., NLI, summarization, user understanding, and ranking) to dif- ferent large language model agents, ARAG enables: (i) Context A wareness:Both long-term and short-term user behaviors factor into the final ranking, (ii) Semantic Grounding: NLI and summariza- tion agents enhance interpretability and precision, and (iii) Person- alization: The final score reflects the user’s unique and evolving preferences, ensuring recommendations remain both relevant and adaptable. 3 Experiments 3.1 Dataset Our experiments utilize the widely-adopted Amazon Review dataset (He & McAuley, 2016), a large-scale collection of product reviews and metadata spanning multiple product categories on Amazon.com. This dataset contains millions of customer reviews, ratings, and product interactions across
