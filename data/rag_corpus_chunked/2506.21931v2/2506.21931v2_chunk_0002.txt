Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation for Person- alized Recommendation. In Proceedings of ACM’s Special Interest Group on Information Retrieval (SIGIR). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 5 pages. 1 Introduction Adapting Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to rec- ommendation scenarios offers promising opportunities to enhance the accuracy and personalization of suggestions [3, 4]. In this con- text, RAG can be leveraged to augment traditional recommendation algorithms with real-time, diverse information retrieval. By incor- porating RAG, recommendation systems can go beyond relying solely on user preferences and item characteristics stored in a static database. Instead, they can dynamically fetch and consider addi- tional relevant data such as recent trends, user reviews, expert opinions, or even real-time market data [14]. This approach allows arXiv:2506.21931v2 [cs.IR] 11 Aug 2025 SIGIR, July 13-17, 2025, Padova, Italy Maragheh et al. Figure 1: ARAG framework: the User Understanding Agent summarizes long-term and session-level preferences; the NLI Agent scores each candidate for semantic alignment; the Context Summary Agent condenses NLI-filtered evidence into a focused context; and the Item Ranker Agent fuses these signals to produce the final personalized ranking. for more context-aware and up-to-date recommendations. For in- stance, a movie recommendation system using RAG could retrieve and analyze recent critic reviews, audience reactions, and current cultural trends to provide more timely and relevant suggestions. Moreover, RAG can help explain recommendations by retrieving and presenting supporting information, enhancing user trust and engagement [8]. The adaptive nature of RAG also enables recom- mendation systems to handle long-tail items or new users more effectively by drawing upon a broader knowledge base, potentially addressing common challenges like cold start problems in collabo- rative filtering [15]. While RAG systems have shown promise in enhancing recom- mendation systems, there is significant room for improvement in their performance and effectiveness. The current limitations of RAG in recommendation
