in the Clothing domain (42.12% for NDCG@5, 35.54% for Hit@5), followed by Electronics (37.94% and 30.87%) and Home (25.60% and 22.68%). This pattern suggests that the effectiveness of Agentic RAG may vary by domain characteristics, with potentially greater benefits in categories where item attributes and user prefer- ences are more diverse or complex. The consistency of improvement across all datasets validates that the agentic approach addresses fun- damental limitations in both recency-based and standard retrieval methods for conversational recommendation tasks. Interestingly, the comparative performance between Recency- based Ranking and Vanilla RAG varies by domain. In the Clothing category, Recency-based approaches outperform Vanilla RAG (0.309 vs. 0.299 for NDCG@5), while the opposite holds for Electronics and Home categories. This observation points to domain-specific dy- namics in user recommendation patterns, where temporal recency may be more valuable in fashion-oriented categories compared to electronics or home goods. Despite these variations, the consistent superiority of Agentic RAG across all domains indicates that the intelligent, adaptive retrieval strategies employed by the agentic framework offer substantial advantages over both temporal and standard retrieval approaches in conversational recommendation scenarios. 3.4 Ablation Study The ablation study (second part of Table 1) highlights the incre- mental benefits of each component in our recommendation pipeline. Starting from the Vanilla RAG baseline, which yields modest NDCG@5 scores of 0.299, 0.238, and 0.229 for Clothing, Electronics, and Home, adding the User Summary Agent leads to consistent gains across all domains—most notably in Electronics (14.4% improvement in NDCG@5) and Home (8.9%). These results confirm the importance of user preference summarization for enhancing context relevance beyond static embedding-based retrieval. Introducing the Context Summary Agent further boosts per- formance, especially in the Clothing domain (28.8% NDCG@5 im- provement), suggesting that item-level contextual understanding is critical in categories where compatibility and style matter.
