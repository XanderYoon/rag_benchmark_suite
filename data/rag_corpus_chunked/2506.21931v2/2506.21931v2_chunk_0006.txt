is to produce a final ranking, or a permutation 𝜋 over the I: 𝜋 = 𝑓Rank (u, I), which orders items by their relevance to the user’s contextu. 2.2 ARAG framework In this subsection we formally introduce the components of ARAG. 2.2.1 Initial cosine similarity-based RAG. We use a RAG framework to obtain an initial subset I0 ⊆ I of candidate items. Assume there is an embedding function: 𝑓Emb : I ∪ { u} → R𝑑, which maps both items and user context into a shared𝑑-dimensional embedding space. We measure similarity between two embeddings via sim(·, ·), e.g., cosine similarity. The top-𝑘 retrieved items are chosen by: I0 = argtop𝑘 n sim 𝑓Emb (𝑖), 𝑓Emb (u) 𝑖 ∈ I o . This yields an initial recall set of size 𝑘 that will be refined by subsequent agents. 2.2.2 NLI Agent for Contextual Alignment. A Natural Language Inference (NLI) Agent evaluates each item 𝑖 ∈ I 0 to check how well its metadata 𝑇 (𝑖) aligns with the user context. Let 𝑠NLI (𝑖, u) = Φ 𝑇 (𝑖), u, denote the alignment score produced by the NLI Agent, where Φ is an LLM-based function. A high score indicates that 𝑖 strongly supports or matches the user’s interests. 2.2.3 Context Summary Agent. A Context Summary Agent(CSA) then summarizes the textual metadata of only those candidate items that the NLI Agent has deemed sufficiently aligned with the user context. Formally, define I+ = { 𝑖 ∈ I 0 | 𝑠NLI (𝑖, u) ≥ 𝜃 }, where 𝑠NLI (𝑖, u) is the NLI alignment score and 𝜃 is a threshold above which an item is considered accepted. The Context Summary Agent then produces a concise summary, 𝑆ctx = Ψ n 𝑇 (𝑖) 𝑖 ∈ I + o , where Ψ(·) is an LLM-driven summarization
