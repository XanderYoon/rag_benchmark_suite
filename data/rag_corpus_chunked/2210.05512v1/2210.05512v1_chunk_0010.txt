uses the concatenation of query and the document as the input to a BERT encoder. The BERT encoder is then followed by a projection layer 𝑊𝑝𝑟𝑜 𝑗 on top of its [𝐶𝐿𝑆 ] token to compute the relevance score: 𝑠 (𝑞, 𝑑) = 𝐵𝐸𝑅𝑇 ( [𝐶𝐿𝑆 ] 𝑞 [𝑆𝐸𝑃 ] 𝑑 [𝑆𝐸𝑃 ]) [𝐶𝐿𝑆 ] ∗ 𝑊𝑝𝑟𝑜 𝑗 (4) In this equation, 𝑞 and 𝑑 represent the query and the document respectively and [𝐶𝐿𝑆 ] as well as [𝑆𝐸𝑃 ] are special BERT tokens [8]. 4https://github.com/ielab/TILDE/tree/main/TILDEv2 ICTIR ’22, July 11–12, 2022, Madrid, Spain.

This dataset was originally introduced as a benchmark for representation learn- ing tasks. Later, several works including [1, 19] used the tasks of {co-view, co-read, citation, co-citation}-prediction from this bench- mark as a query-by-example retrieval setting. As Figure 2 depicts, in this setting, given a query document, the goal is to retrieve and rank the most relevant documents out of a collection. The evalu- ation dataset for each of these four tasks includes approximately 30K total papers from a held-out pool of papers, consisting of 1K query papers and a candidate set of up to 5 positive papers and 25 negative papers [5]. To make our results comparable, we follow the prior work on SciDocs to prepare the same training data [ 1]. To this aim, we take the validation set of each of tasks and use 85% of them as training and 15% of them as the validation. Thus, each query in the train set has 5 relevant documents and 25 non-relevant documents. While TILDE is trained over
