Non-oracle interpolation. We can see in Figure 3 (blue lines) that for the effective interpolations, i.e, the interpolations that result in higher effectiveness than each individual ranker included in the interpolation, the interpolation weight 𝛼 in the combination of BM25 and TILDEv2 has a wider range than in the combination of BM25 and TILDE. This indicates that in this experimental setting the interpolation of BM25 and TILDEv2 could be achieved by a broader range of 𝛼 values and is therefore more robust to the choice of interpolation weight than for BM25 and TILDE. Oracle interpolation. As a measure of the statistical dispersion, we report the inter-quartile range (IQR) for the oracle interpolation weight 𝛼 which is shown in Table 4. Taking the range of 𝛼 [0.0, 1.0] into account, we can see that we have low inter-quartile range (IQR) for the optimal values of𝛼 per query in the interpolation with TILDE (top part of the table). On the other hand, the IQR for the optimal values of 𝛼 per query for the interpolation with TILDEv2 are much higher (bottom part of the table), which indicates that the optimal interpolation setting for the queries are more varied. This observation could give some sense of robustness against query variation for TILDE in comparison to TILDEv2 in this experimental setting. In other words, a query-dependent approach for
