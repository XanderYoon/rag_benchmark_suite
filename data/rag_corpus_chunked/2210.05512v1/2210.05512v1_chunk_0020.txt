that using 𝑚 = 100 results in roughly 2.6 new tokens on average. These numbers beside the statistics of the tokens in SciDocs benchmark, provided in Section 3.4, indicate that 𝑚 should be tuned in order to take advantage from the document expansion with TILDE in QBE retrieval setting. Finally, we see that the zero-shot utilization of TILDEMSMARCO and TILDEv2MSMARCO does not show superior performance over the fine-tuned TILDE and TILDEv2 with both BERT and SciBERT encoders. It should be noted that taking models which are already fine-tuned on general domain (like TILDEMSMARCO and TILDEv2MSMARCO) and further On the Interpolation of Contextualized Term-based Ranking with BM25 for Query-by-Example Retrieval ICTIR ’22, July 11–12, 2022, Madrid, Spain. Table 3: Results for non-oracle interpolation (the interpolation parameter 𝛼 is optimized on the validation set) between BM25𝑆𝑇 𝑀2, TILDE 𝑆𝑐𝑖𝐵𝐸𝑅𝑇 , and TILDEv2 𝑆𝑐𝑖𝐵𝐸𝑅𝑇 . Statistical significance improvements are according to paired t-test (p<0.05) with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. Rows 𝑎, 𝑏, and 𝑐 are included from Table 1 for ease of comparison.
