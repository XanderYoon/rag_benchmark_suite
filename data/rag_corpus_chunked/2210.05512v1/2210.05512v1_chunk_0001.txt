contextualized term-based ranking models being beneficial in QBE setting. We follow-up on our findings by studying the score interpolation between the relevance score from TILDE (TILDEv2) and BM25. We conclude that these two contextualized term-based ranking models capture different relevance signals than BM25 and combining the different term-based rankers results in statistically significant improvements in QBE retrieval. Our work sheds light on the challenges of retrieval settings different from the common evaluation benchmarks. It could be of value as future work to study other contextualized term-based ranking models in QBE settings.

This retrieval setup is typical in professional, domain-specific tasks such as legal case law retrieval [1, 2], patent prior art search [11, 24, 25], and scientific literature search [1, 19, 20]. While using a document as a query could become challenging due to its length and complex semantic structure, prior work has shown
