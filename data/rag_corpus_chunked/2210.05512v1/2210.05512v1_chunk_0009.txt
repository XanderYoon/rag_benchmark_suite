𝑞 and 𝑑 are the query and the document respectively;𝑑 𝑗 is the 𝑗th token of the document;𝑣𝑑 𝑗 is the term importance weight for the 3https://github.com/ielab/TILDE 𝑗th token of𝑑 , and 𝑐 (𝑞𝑖 ) is the count of the𝑖-th unique token which is achieved by using the BERT tokenizer as the query encoder. In this equation, 𝑣𝑑 𝑗 is computed using the same method as in Lin and Ma [16] in which a 𝑅𝐸𝐿𝑈 function is used on the projection layer to force the model to map the token representations into a positive scalar weight: 𝑣𝑑 𝑗 = 𝑅𝑒𝐿𝑈 (𝑊 1×𝑛 𝑝𝑟𝑜 𝑗 𝐵𝐸𝑅𝑇 (𝑑 𝑗 ) + 𝑏) (3) in which𝑑 𝑗 is the 𝑗th token in document𝑑 and 𝑏 is the learnable bias parameter of the projection layer𝑊𝑝𝑟𝑜 𝑗 . Lin and Ma [16] show that using a scalar weight as term importance (uniCOIL [16]) instead of a vector representation (COIL [12]) results in a decrease in the effectiveness; however, by using query expansion, uniCOIL can achieve higher effectiveness. Following the method proposed by Zhuang and Zuccon [33] for query expansion with TILDE, we will show how TILDEv2 will act when we expand documents with TILDE. For TILDEv2, we use the implementation from the authors’ code repository.4 2.4 Cross-encoder BERT Ranker The state-of-the-art results on SciDocs is reported by Abolghasemi et al. [1] where they use a multi-task optimized cross-encoder BERT ranker [22]. The cross-encoder BERT ranker uses the concatenation of query and the document as the input to a BERT encoder. The BERT encoder is then followed by a projection layer 𝑊𝑝𝑟𝑜 𝑗 on top of its [𝐶𝐿𝑆 ] token to compute the relevance score: 𝑠 (𝑞, 𝑑) = 𝐵𝐸𝑅𝑇 ( [𝐶𝐿𝑆 ] 𝑞 [𝑆𝐸𝑃 ] 𝑑 [𝑆𝐸𝑃 ]) [𝐶𝐿𝑆 ] ∗ 𝑊𝑝𝑟𝑜 𝑗 (4) In
