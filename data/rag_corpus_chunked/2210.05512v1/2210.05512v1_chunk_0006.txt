development; • We show that the relevance signals of TILDE and TILDEv2 can be complementary to that of BM25 as interpolation of the methods leads to an improvement in ranking effectiveness; • We also investigate interpolations of BM25 with TILDE and TILDEv2 in an ideal setting where the optimal interpolation weight is known a priori, and by doing so, we show that more stratified approaches for the interpolation could result in higher gains from the interpolation of BM25 with TILDE and TILDEv2. In section 2 we describe the retrieval models used in this work. In section 3 we provide details about our methods and experiments and in section 4 we analyze the results and discuss the answers to our research questions. Section 5 is dedicated to to further analysis of the results, and finally, in Section 6 we provide the conclusion.

For BM25 [ 27], we use the implementation by Elastic- search2 with the parameters 𝑘 = 2.75, and 𝑏 = 1, which was tuned over the validation set. Probabilistic Language Models. For language modeling (LM) based retrieval [4, 13, 26], we use the built-in similarity functions of Elas- ticsearch for the implementation of language model with Jelinek Mercer (JM) smoothing [32]. 2.2 Term Independent Likelihood Model: TILDE TILDE is a tokenizer-based term-based retrieval model which fol- lows a term independence assumption and formulates the likelihood of a query as follows: TILDE-QL(𝑞|𝑑) = |𝑞 |∑︁ 𝑖 𝑙𝑜𝑔 (𝑃𝜃 (𝑞𝑖 |𝑑)) (1) in which 𝑞 is the query, and 𝑑 is the document. As Figure 1 shows, to compute the relevance score,
