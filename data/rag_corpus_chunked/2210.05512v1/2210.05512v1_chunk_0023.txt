a substantial improvement for both TILDE and TILDEv2. Moreover, we can see in Table 4 that there is a subset of queries for which the BM25 ranking alone is better than the interpolation (queries with optimal 𝛼=1). This number is lower for the interpo- lation with TILDE than for the interpolation with TILDEv2. One hypothesis for this observation could be that the interpolation with TILDE is likely to be more helpful for BM25 since TILDE could bring more contextualization power for BM25 as it incorporates the term importance for all tokens in the query. In other words, since TILDEv2 pre-computes term weights only for the tokens of the document (whereas TILDE pre-computes the term importance weight for all the tokens in the BERT vocabulary per document), due to the chance of vocabulary mismatch in TILDEv2, it could incorporate less query-dependent contextualization than TILDE. In addition, we see that the margin between the oracle interpola- tion results and both non-interpolated scores as well as non-oracle interpolation scores (Table 3) is substantial, which demonstrates that more complex aggregation methods could benefit more from the relevance signals from TILDE, TILDEv2 and BM25. 5 DISCUSSION In this section, we further analyze the interpolation between BM25 and TILDE (TILDEv2) in terms of the interpolation effectiveness and the interpolation weight 𝛼. 5.1 Interpolation effectiveness The first two rows on the top of Figure 3 correspond to the inter- polation between TILDE and BM25 and the two rows in the bot- tom correspond to the interpolation between TILDEv2 and BM25. Comparing the nDCG and MAP plots for the interpolation between TILDE and BM25, we can see that for this combination,𝛼=0.1 shows the highest ranking quality for both nDCG and MAP metrics in all tasks. Thus, a high weight for TILDE with a small weight for BM25 ICTIR
