retrieval on documents which are expanded at indexing time. To this aim, we use TILDE in the same way as the original paper [33]. TILDE is at an advantage where it is more efficient than doc2query [23]. In this work, using TILDE SciBERT of which we found it performs the best compared to other TILDE models (Table 1), we generate 𝑚 = 200, and 𝑚 = 300 expansion terms for TILDEv2SciBERT. It is noteworthy that similar to the original paper [33] not all expansion terms are added to a document, but only new expansion terms — that are not yet present in the document — are added. 3.5 Domain-Specific BERT in TILDE and TILDEv2 To answer RQ1, and RQ4, we will investigate the power that can be brought by domain-specific pre-training to term-based rank- ing models. To do so, we evaluate the models’ ranking quality in On the Interpolation of Contextualized Term-based Ranking with BM25 for Query-by-Example Retrieval ICTIR ’22, July 11–12, 2022, Madrid, Spain.
