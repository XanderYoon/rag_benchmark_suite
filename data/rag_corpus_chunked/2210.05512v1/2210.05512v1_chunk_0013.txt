(𝑞, 𝑑) (5) Here, 𝑠𝐵𝑀 25 stands for the BM25 score for query 𝑞, and document 𝑑, and 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡𝑢𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑧𝑒𝑑 refers to the relevance score from TILDE or TILDEv2. Also, 𝛼 is the hyperparameter that controls the impact of the scores from BM25 and TILDE (or TILDEv2). Prior to the interpo- lation both of the relevance scores are normalized using 𝑧-scaling (subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation). We optimize 𝛼 on the validation set. Additionally, to further investigate the impact of interpolation, we do a per-query oracle interpolation in which we assume the best interpolation setting, i.e., optimal 𝛼, could be predicted per query, and thus we can explore how much effectiveness is reachable by the interpolation of the scores. In the following of the paper, “oracle interpolation” refers to this latter interpolation setup and “non-oracle interpolation” refers to the vanilla interpolation, i.e., one 𝛼 for all queries that is optimized on the validation set. 3.4 Document Expansion with TILDE The Average token count of SciDocs documents (abstract+title) is 219 and 208 for BERT and SciBERT respectively. Their 90% token count quantiles are 341 and 385. Comparing these numbers to the maximum input length of BERT models, i.e., 512 tokens, we can see a capacity for the expansion of the documents. To further investigate RQ1, following recent works which use document expansion to alleviate the vocabulary mismatch in contextualized term-based retrieval [16, 33], we evaluate the impact of retrieval on documents which are expanded at indexing time. To this aim, we use TILDE in the same way as the original paper [33]. TILDE is at an advantage where it is more efficient than doc2query [23]. In this work, using TILDE SciBERT of which we found it performs the best compared to other TILDE models (Table 1), we generate
