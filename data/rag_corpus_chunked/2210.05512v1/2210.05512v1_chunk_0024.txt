rows in the bot- tom correspond to the interpolation between TILDEv2 and BM25. Comparing the nDCG and MAP plots for the interpolation between TILDE and BM25, we can see that for this combination,𝛼=0.1 shows the highest ranking quality for both nDCG and MAP metrics in all tasks. Thus, a high weight for TILDE with a small weight for BM25 ICTIR ’22, July 11–12, 2022, Madrid, Spain. Amin Abolghasemi, Arian Askari, and Suzan Verberne Figure 3: Results for TILDE and TILDEv2 with varying values of interpolation parameter 𝛼. The lines in blue and orange represent the effectiveness based on the non-oracle and oracle interpolations respectively. 𝛼 = 0.0 represents the TILDE- or TILDEv2-only setting; 𝛼 = 1.0 represents the BM25-only setting. gives the highest effectiveness for this combination. This observa- tion could mean that while TILDE, as contextualized transformer- based model, is able to outperform BM25 as an exact matching model, it could still benefit from the strong lexical relevance scores from BM25. On the other hand, for the combination of TILDEv2 and BM25 we see that the highest ranking quality is obtained with 𝛼 ∈ {0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8} depending on the task. The exceptions are in the cite, and coview tasks as described in the answer to RQ3 in Section 4. Thus, in the combination of TILDEv2 and BM25, an equal or slightly higher weight for BM25 relative to TILDEvs gives the optimal results. A hypothesis for this observation could be that while both BM25 and TILDEv2 are performing based on exact matching, the term weights from TILDEv2, which are predicted On the Interpolation of Contextualized Term-based Ranking with BM25 for Query-by-Example Retrieval ICTIR ’22, July 11–12, 2022, Madrid, Spain.
