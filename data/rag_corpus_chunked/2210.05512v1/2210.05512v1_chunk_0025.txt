this observation could be that while both BM25 and TILDEv2 are performing based on exact matching, the term weights from TILDEv2, which are predicted On the Interpolation of Contextualized Term-based Ranking with BM25 for Query-by-Example Retrieval ICTIR ’22, July 11–12, 2022, Madrid, Spain. Table 4: Results for oracle interpolation (optimal 𝛼 per query) between BM25𝑆𝑇 𝑀2, TILDE𝑆𝑐𝑖𝐵𝐸𝑅𝑇 , and TILDEv2𝑆𝑐𝑖𝐵𝐸𝑅𝑇 . Statisti- cal significance with paired t-test (p<0.05) is reported only with respect to non-interpolated scores ( 𝛼=0) of these three models in Table 1 (row a, e and h). 𝛼 average represents the mean of the optimal 𝛼 values picked per query. The number of queries with optimal 𝛼=0 stands for the number of queries for which the interpolation does not improve their effectiveness compared to TILDE or TILDEv2 only.
