the BM25 score over varying values of interpolation parameter 𝛼 with the step of 0.1. Besides, Table 3 shows the ranking quality for the in- terpolations with the 𝛼 that is tuned over the validation set. We can see that an optimal interpolation between the scores from BM25 and the contextualized term-based ranking models TILDE and TILDEv2 could provide significant improvements for almost all tasks over the individual rankers participating in the interpolation. The only exceptions are in the co-view, and cite tasks. To be specific, there is no improvement over BM25 in the nDCG metric in theco-view (line e vs. line a in Table 3). Besides, in the cite task the improvement over TILDEv2 (line e vs. line c in Table 3) is not significant for the nDCG metric, and there is no improvement for the MAP metric. Nevertheless, the improvements obtained by the interpolation for almost all tasks and metrics indicates that TILDE and TILDEv2 are capturing different relevance signals compared to BM25. To further investigate the impact of the score interpolation with BM25 scores, we perform an oracle interpolation in which we as- sume the optimal interpolation hyperparameter𝛼 is known for each individual query. This query-specific optimal value is selected over varying values of 𝛼 with the step of 0.1. Table 4 as well as orange lines in Figure 3 show the results for the oracle interpolation. We can see that the oracle interpolation would result in a substantial improvement for both TILDE and TILDEv2. Moreover, we can see in Table 4 that there is a subset of queries for which the BM25 ranking alone is better than the interpolation (queries with optimal 𝛼=1). This number is lower for the interpo- lation with TILDE than for the interpolation with TILDEv2. One hypothesis for this observation could be
