Statistical significance improvements are according to paired t-test (p<0.05) with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing.

It is noteworthy that to make sure we are expanding the documents with enough tokens we investigate the average number of tokens added to the documents by the expansion with TILDESciBERT. By doing so, we find that for 𝑚 = 200, and 𝑚 = 300, approximately 49 and 128 new tokens are appended to the documents on average. Additionally, we find that using 𝑚 = 100 results in roughly 2.6 new tokens on average. These numbers beside the statistics of the tokens in SciDocs benchmark, provided in Section 3.4, indicate that 𝑚 should be tuned in order to take advantage from the document expansion with TILDE in QBE retrieval setting. Finally, we see that the zero-shot utilization of TILDEMSMARCO and TILDEv2MSMARCO
