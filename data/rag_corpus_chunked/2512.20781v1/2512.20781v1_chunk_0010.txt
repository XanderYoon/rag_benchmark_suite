pipeline that expands CIR datasets with multi-target triplets and refines them into discriminative single-target triplets. Stage 1 identifies multiple valid targets using both visual and textual similarity signals. Stage 2 rewrites the modifica- tion text to distinguish one target from semantically similar distractors. This design supports both inclusive and precise evaluation. An overview is illustrated in Figure 3. Stage 1: Multi-Target Triplet Construction.We first re- trieve a diverse set of plausible targets for each (reference image, modification text) pair using three CLIP-based crite- ria: • Textual to Modification: Top-k images similar to a text query describing the modification only. • Compositional: Top-k images similar to a composed query combining the modification and non-conflicting details from the reference image. • Visual Similarity to Original Target: Top-k images simi- lar to the original ground-truth image. The textual queries in (1) and (2) are generated by prompt- ing an LLM to produce two concise sentences: one for the modification, and another preserving non-conflicting aspects of the reference. This allows fine-grained, compositional re- trieval. From the three groups of top-k candidates—each cor- responding to one retrieval criterion—we apply an LLM- based visual assessor to assign a confidence score between 0.0 and 1.0 for each image. Scoring is performed group- wise, with the reference image and modification text pro- vided as context. Any image that receives a score above a predefined threshold (denotedτ) in its respective group is selected as a valid multi-target. We useτ= 0.85and k= 10by default. This approach ensures high-quality se- mantic coverage while requiring no manual annotation. Stage 2: Single-Target Rewriting via Contrastive Prompting.To evaluate fine-grained discrimination, we convert multi-target pools into single-target triplets. From each pool, we randomly sample one target and two con- trastive distractors. An LLM is then prompted with the ref- erence image, original modification, target, and
