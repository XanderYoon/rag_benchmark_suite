SEARLE demonstrates the most stable performance when λ= 0.2, while CIReVL improves steadily up toλ= 1.0. Accordingly, we setλ= 0.2for SEARLE andλ= 1.0for CIReVL as the default values in subsequent analyses. Tables S4, S5, and S6 present a component-wise analysis of SoFT, where each constraint—Reward and Penalty—is applied individually or in combination. Overall, the com- bination of both constraints generally leads to the highest scores, indicating that their synergy tends to enhance re- trieval precision and robustness. At the same time, applying only the reward constraint yields more stable performance than using the penalty constraint alone, suggesting that posi- tive guidance aligns more consistently with the base retrieval signal.
