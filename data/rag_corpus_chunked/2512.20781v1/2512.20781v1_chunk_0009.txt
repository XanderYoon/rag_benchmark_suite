Stage 1 selects diverse target images for each reference- modification pair to capture open-ended user intent. Stage 2 rewrites the modification text to focus on a specific target with contrastive distractors, enabling precise single-target evaluation. into any CIR systems, making it especially suitable for zero- shot settings where architectural changes or supervision are impractical. 3.2 Multi-Target Triplet Dataset Pipeline Most CIR benchmarks assume a single ground-truth image per query, which limits evaluation under ambiguous or open- ended user intents. To address this, we propose a two-stage pipeline that expands CIR datasets with multi-target triplets and refines them into discriminative single-target triplets. Stage 1 identifies multiple valid targets using both visual and textual similarity signals. Stage 2 rewrites the modifica- tion text to distinguish one target from semantically similar distractors. This design supports both inclusive and precise evaluation. An overview is illustrated in Figure 3. Stage 1:
