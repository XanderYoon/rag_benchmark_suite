better satisfy the modification intent, such retrievals may not be reflected as correct during evaluation, leading to apparent instabil- ity or diminished gains. By explicitly incorporating multiple valid targets per query, the Multi-Target benchmark allevi- ates this issue and provides a more faithful assessment of SoFT’s impact. Overall, these results suggest that the observed instabil- ity of SoFT in the standard FashionIQ setting stems largely from annotation underspecification, rather than from the filtering mechanism itself. When evaluation protocols bet- ter align with the open-ended nature of user intent, SoFT demonstrates consistent and robust improvements across a wide range of configurations. B.3 Qualitative Results We present examples from our multi-target versions of CIRR and FashionIQ in Figure S1 and S2. Each example in- cludes the original triplet, a set of valid target images, and a refined modification text for a randomly selected target (highlighted in red box). These examples illustrate the am- biguity in user intent and how our pipeline resolves it into precise single-target queries.
