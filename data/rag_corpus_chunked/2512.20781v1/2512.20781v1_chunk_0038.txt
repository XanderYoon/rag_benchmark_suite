FashionIQ.We evalu- ate SoFT on the Multi-Target versions of two stan- dard CIR benchmarks: CIRR and FashionIQ. Experi- ments are conducted using two baseline retrieval mod- els—CIReVL and SEARLE—with and without the pro- posed SoFT module. We vary the interpolation weightλ∈ {0.1,0.3,0.5,0.7,0.9,1.0}, which adjusts the relative con- tribution of the constraint-based reweighting to the base model score. Values in parentheses in the tables denote the λused. Performance is reported in terms of R@5, R@10, R@25, and R@50. Impact of Target Annotation on SoFT Effectiveness. We observe a clear difference in the stability of SoFT’s ef- fectiveness between the standard and Multi-Target versions of FashionIQ, particularly when SEARLE is used as the base retriever. As shown in Table S3, under the original single- target benchmark, applying SoFT does not consistently im- prove performance: in several cases, the baseline retriever without SoFT achieves the highest score. In contrast, re- sults reported in Tables S9 through S13 show that under the Multi-Target setting, SoFT consistently improves retrieval performance across categories and evaluation metrics. This trend holds regardless of the specific value ofλor the under- lying retriever, indicating that SoFT’s effectiveness becomes substantially more reliable when multiple valid targets are taken into account. This discrepancy is attributed to differences in target an- notation scope. In the original FashionIQ benchmark, each query is paired with a single annotated target, despite the existence of multiple semantically valid candidates. Conse- quently, even when SoFT promotes images that better satisfy the modification intent, such retrievals may not be reflected as correct during evaluation, leading to apparent instabil- ity or diminished gains. By explicitly incorporating multiple valid targets per query, the Multi-Target benchmark allevi- ates this issue and provides a more faithful assessment of SoFT’s impact. Overall, these results suggest that the observed instabil- ity of SoFT in the
