confidence scores assigned to original benchmark targets by our LLM- based scoring module. Building on these multi-target sets, we further construct single-target triplets to support precise evaluation under con- trastive conditions. This stage is applied only to queries with at least three valid targets from Stage 1, ensuring that one target and two contrastive distractors can be selected from the same candidate pool. As a result, single-target triplets are constructed for 2,245 CIRR queries, and for 1,681, 1,827 and 1,666 queries in the Shirt, Dress and Toptee sub- sets of FashionIQ, respectively. As illustrated in Figure 3, the refined texts introduce precise descriptors—e.g., “gray coat”, “crocheted toy”—that improve discriminative power in high-similarity scenarios. More qualitative examples of the constructed triplets for both CIRR and FashionIQ are provided in the Appendix. 4 Experiments 4.1 Experimental Setup Datasets.We evaluate SoFT on three standard CIR benchmarks-CIRCO (Baldrati et al. 2023b), CIRR (Liu et al. 2021b), and FashionIQ (Wu et al. 2021)-as well as our ex- tended Multi-Target variants. CIRCO is constructed from the COCO 2017 unlabeled set (Lin et al. 2014), provides multiple valid targets per query. CIRR contains real-world scene images and is designed to test fine-grained reasoning via retrieval within visually similar subsets. FashionIQ is a fashion-focused benchmark comprising triplets across Shirt, Dress and Toptee categories, with evaluation conducted on the validation split. For both CIRCO and CIRR, evaluation is performed on the official test split by submitting prediction files to the respective evaluation servers. Baselines.We compare our method against two publicly available CIR baselines: SEARLE (Baldrati et al. 2023a) and CIReVL (Karthik et al. 2024). Both provide full imple- mentations and serve as reliable references for evaluating plug-and-play compatibility.
