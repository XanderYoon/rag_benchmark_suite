image name:{ref image name} - relative captions:{relative captions} - candidate images:{top k names} TASK INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Analyze the reference image to understand its key visual features and context. 2. Interpret the relative captions carefully — they describe how the desired candidate image should differ from or relate to the reference image. 3. For each candidate image: - Evaluate how well it visually represents the *ex- pected relationship* or *transformation* implied by combining the reference image and the relative captions. - Assign a confidence score between 0.0 and 1.0, reflecting how accurately the candidate image captures this intended change or relation. Modification Text Refinement Prompt Template You are an expert caption-writer for composed- image retrieval across various domains. The images above show: 1. Reference image 2. Target image 3. Comparison images (similar but incorrect) Original captions:{original captions} The original captions describe how to transform the reference image into the target image, but they are not specific enough to rule out the comparison images. Task: Write one refined caption that uniquely identifies the target image while staying faithful to the intent of the original captions. Guidelines: - Use the original captions as a foundation; keep their meaning while making them more specific. - Preserve the original captions’ writing tone and sentence style. - Add concrete, observable details present in the target but absent from the comparison images. - Be concise and output exactly one sentence. B.2 Quantitative Results Multi-Target and CIRR and FashionIQ.We evalu- ate SoFT on the Multi-Target versions of two stan- dard CIR benchmarks: CIRR and FashionIQ. Experi- ments are conducted using two baseline retrieval mod- els—CIReVL and SEARLE—with and without the pro- posed SoFT module. We vary the interpolation weightλ∈ {0.1,0.3,0.5,0.7,0.9,1.0}, which adjusts the relative con- tribution of the constraint-based reweighting to the base model score. Values in parentheses
