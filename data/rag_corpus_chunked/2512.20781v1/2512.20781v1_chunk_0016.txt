SoFT consistently improves mAP@5 and mAP@25 across all categories and base mod- els. and CIRR. On CIRCO with ViT-B/32, it enhancesmAP@5 from 9.35 to 12.57 (+3.22) andmAP@50from 11.84 to 15.17 (+3.33) for SEARLE. For CIReVL, the improvements are more substantial:mAP@5increases from 14.94 to 19.21 (+4.27) andmAP@50from from 17.82 to 22.75 (+4.93). With the stronger ViT-L/14 backbone, CIReVL show the most significant gains—mAP@5 rises from 18.57 to 23.90 (+5.33), and mAP@50 from 21.80 to 27.93 (+6.13). On CIRR, SoFT also yields consistent gains, especially in the subsetsplit, which demands finer-grained disambiguation. For example, when applied to SEARLE with ViT-B/32, R@1on the subset improves from 54.89 to 64.29, surpassing both LDRE (60.53) and OSrCIR (62.31). CIReVL+SoFT further raisesR@1from 60.17 to 70.31 (+10.14), again out- performing all baselines. Similar trends are observed with ViT-L/14. Table 2 shows that SoFT also benefits CIReVL on the FashionIQ, with average improvements of +2.76 (R@10) and +3.5 (R@50) on ViT-B/32, and even higher gains on ViT-L/14. In contrast, SEARLE exhibits mixed results, showing improvements in some cases but slight declines in others. These fluctuations may stem from the differing rea- soning mechanisms of the two retrievers. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that on Multi-Target FashionIQ, SoFT consis- tently improves performance regardless of the base model (see Sec 4.3). This suggests that while baseline charac- teristics affect stability, the occasional drops on the stan- dard FashionIQ are more likely due to the dataset’s limita- tion—implicitly overlooking semantically valid alternative targets rather than reflecting a failure of SoFT itself. To ensure that the improvements stem
