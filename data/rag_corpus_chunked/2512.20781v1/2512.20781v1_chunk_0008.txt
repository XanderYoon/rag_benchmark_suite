mod, we prompt an instruction-tuned LLM in two step. Full prompt template is provided in the Appendix. In Step 1: Attribute Classification, the LLM identifies key attribute-value pairs and categorizes them into three types: keepattributes, which should be retained from the reference image;addattributes, which are newly required according to the modification; andremoveattributes, which are present in the reference but should be eliminated in the target. Unlike generic descriptions, the LLM is instructed to infer attributes critical for achieving the transformation. In Step 2: Constraint Generation, these sets are converted into: • aprescriptive constraint,(combiningkeepandadd), and • aproscriptive constraint(based onremove). These serve as semantic filters, enforcing bidirectional con- trol over the retrieval output. Soft Reweighting with Dual Constraints.Given the two constraints, we adjust candidate similarity score without modifying the underlying model. For each candidate image Ic, we compute CLIP-based cosine similarities in the joint embedding space: •s base: similarity between(I ref , Tmod)andI c from a CIR model; •s reward: similarity betweenI c and the prescriptive con- straint; •s penalty: similarity betweenI c and the proscriptive con- straint. We then compute a SoFT scores SoFT defined as: sSoFT =s base ⊙ sreward + 1−s penalty 2 (1) Finally, the reweighted similarity scores final used for ranking is given by: sfinal = (1−λ)s base +λs SoFT (2) This formulation enablessoft constraint enforcementby promoting candidates aligned with the prescriptive intent while down-weighting those associated with the proscrip- tive constraint. The final score, computed as a convex com- bination of the base and filtered scores, remains continuous, interpretable, and tunable. Importantly, SoFT ismodel-agnostic and training-free, operating entirely at inference time via score-level modula- tion.
