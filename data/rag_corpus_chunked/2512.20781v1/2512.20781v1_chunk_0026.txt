the reference image and extract three types of attribute-value lists. - “keep”: A list of key attribute values that should remain unchanged in the reference image according to the modification text. - “add”: A list of attribute values that are not present in the reference image but are explicitly or implicitly required by the modification text. - “remove”: A list of attribute values that are present in the reference image but are explicitly removed by the modification text. ## Step 2. Query Generation Using the attribute-value lists from Step 1, generate text queries that can be directly used for image retrieval. Each query must be fluent, self-contained. If an attribute is described in relative terms, you must resolve it into a concrete absolute caption using visual clues from the reference image. - “prescriptive query”: Write a short, specific image caption that describes the visual features that should be included in the target image, focusing on the attribute values in the “keep” and “add” lists. - “proscriptive query”: Write a short, specific image caption that describes the reference image as it is, using positive, natural language, focusing on the attribute values in the “remove” list. ## Input: Modification Text: “{mod text}” Reference image: Method CIRCO (mAP@k) @5 @10 @25 @50 ViT-B/32 SEARLE 9.35 9.94 11.13 11.84 SEARLE + SoFT (0.1) 11.47 12.14 13.39 14.14 SEARLE + SoFT (0.2) 12.57 13.12 14.38 15.17 SEARLE + SoFT (0.3) 12.37 12.89 14.25 15.00 SEARLE + SoFT (0.5) 11.33 11.61 12.86 13.59 SEARLE + SoFT (0.7) 9.49 9.72 10.81 11.40 SEARLE + SoFT (0.9) 8.19 8.38 9.23 9.72 CIReVL 14.94 15.42 17.00 17.82 CIReVL + SoFT (0.1) 17.68 18.32 20.02 20.91 CIReVL + SoFT (0.3) 17.98 18.61 20.35 21.27 CIReVL + SoFT (0.5) 18.33 18.99 20.72 21.64 CIReVL + SoFT (0.7) 18.65 19.37 21.13 22.08
