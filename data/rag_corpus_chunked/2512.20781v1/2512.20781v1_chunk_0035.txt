Distinct templates are used for CIRR and FashionIQ to account for domain-specific characteristics and annotation styles. Prompt Templates for Confidence Scoring of Candidate Groups.For each (reference image, modification text) pair, we form three candidate groups based on distinct re- trieval criteria:Textual to Modification,Compositional, and Visual Similarity. Each group is then evaluated by an LLM using a unified prompt structure that receives the refer- ence image, the modification text, and the candidate images within the group as input. The LLM assigns a confidence score between 0.0 and 1.0 to each image, indicating how well it aligns with the intended modification. Prompt Template for Refining Single-Target Modifica- tion Text.To support precise evaluation under reduced ambiguity, we refine the original modification text so that it describes a single target image explicitly. This process en- sures that the refined text is not only faithful to the original intent but also discriminative against plausible distractors. Query Generation Prompt Template - CIRR You are given two pieces of input: 1. A reference image description that tells you what the original image looks like. 2. A User’s Modifications text that describes how the user wants the image to be changed. Your task is to write a two-sentence description of the image the user wants. - The sentence1 should focus on the only User’s modifications—describe the image primarily ac- cording to the User’s Modifications. - The sentence2 should preserve the elements from the reference image that do **not** conflict with the User’s Modifications, describing details from the original image that can be retained. If there are no additional elements to preserve beyond what is stated in the User’s Modifications, return an empty string. Describe the image using only concrete, observable attributes. Make sure both sentences are concise and consistent. ## User’s Modifications “{caption1}” Query Generation Prompt Template -
