to identify and link semantically equivalent entities. In the music information retrieval domain, an analogous task is Music Cover Retrieval—also known as Version Identification or Cover Detec- tion—where the goal is to recognize distinct renditions of the same underlying composition [49]. Robust systems are critical for catalog management, copyright enforcement, cross-platform track linking, and music retrieval [49]. Defining similarity between covers, however, is challenging: models must ac- count for wide variations in tempo, pitch, structure, lyrics or recording con- ditions [49]. State-of-the-art approaches have largely focused on harmonic and melodic features, relying on complex pipelines that aim to achieve invariance arXiv:2601.11262v1 [cs.SD] 16 Jan 2026 2 J. Affolter et al. to these attributes [18, 26, 30]. While effective, such models demand significant training time and computational resources, and their growing reliance on deep or multimodal architectures further limits scalability and reproducibility [1]. Unlike melodic or harmonic features, which may vary widely across rendi- tions, prior work has shown that lyrics constitute a strong invariant [1, 10, 15, 31, 46]: (i) they are typically preserved across renditions, (ii) they largely re- tain their semantic content even under translation or minor rewrites, and (iii) they provide decisive cues for distinguishing works that share similar harmonic or melodic profiles. A well-known illustration is Jimi Hendrix’s cover of "All Along the Watchtower" from Bob Dylan, where harmony and melody diverge strongly from the original, yet the lyrics remain largely intact. Despite this, their potential has been underexplored, mainly due to two obstacles: the avail- ability of editorial lyrics at scale—often restricted by third-party licensing—and the challenge of extracting lyrics from polyphonic audio [49], a task where re- cent advances have improved accuracy but remain computationally demanding. While early works that use lyrics [1, 46] relied on relatively simple approaches to derive lyric representations, resulting
