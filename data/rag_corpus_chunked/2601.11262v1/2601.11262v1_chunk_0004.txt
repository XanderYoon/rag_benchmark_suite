such as transposition or structural changes [1, 13, 14, 50, 51]. Beyond these, multimodal methods that integrate complementary features have demonstrated clear advantages over unimodal models [1, 14, 15, 46]. Although lyrics offer a strong discriminative signal for version identifica- tion [1, 15, 31, 46], their integration into Music Cover Retrieval systems is rel- atively recent, primarily due to the absence of large-scale datasets with clean, time-aligned lyrics and the difficulty of transcribing lyrics from polyphonic au- dio [49]. In early attempts, [46] adopted a Singing Voice Recognition (SVR) framework combining a TDNN-based acoustic model [22] with a language model to decode phoneme sequences compared via string matching. [1] proposed a lightweight Automatic Lyrics Recognition (ALR) that produced character pos- teriorgrams subsequently processed by a second, independently trained model fine-tuned for the retrieval task. Although these approaches marked important first steps, they relied on acoustic models to represent lyrics, yielding limited retrieval performance. Moreover, transcription models were trained from scratch on English-only datasets [32], restricting multilingual generalization and adding the overhead of training a separate retrieval model. Recent advances in lyrics-based cover detection include dedicated datasets, such as LyricsCovers 2.0 [4], and new methods [5, 15, 31, 38]. Among these, [15] achieved stronger results by adapting Whisper [36] with lightweight prefix- and suffix-tuning, enabling faster inference while keeping most parameters frozen. However, the approach remains integrated into a complex multimodal pipeline, increasing model size and computational cost, and making it difficult to isolate the impact of lyrics. Reproducibility is further constrained by the lack of open- source implementations and technical details [1]. Automatic Lyrics Recognition.Modern Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems are based on end-to-end neural architectures that map raw audio di- rectly to text, in contrast to older hybrid pipelines combining hidden Markov models with deep neural networks (HMM-DNN) [29].
