applicability dependent on the availability and quality of lyrics information. Incorporating complementary har- monic features could help mitigate this limitation, particularly for cover versions that preserve melodic structure while substantially altering lyrics or falling out- side the scope of the current model. Third, the vocal detection component used during preprocessing is proprietary, which impacts full reproducibility; however, open-source alternatives [8, 37] for vocal activity detection could be explored with limited changes to the pipeline. Finally, although the vocal detection and segmentation stages improve transcription quality, they introduce additional computational overhead that one might want to reduce to gain a substantial runtime improvement compared to audio-only systems such as ByteCover.
