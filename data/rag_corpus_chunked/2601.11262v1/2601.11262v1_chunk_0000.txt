State-of-the-art approaches have largely focused on harmonic and melodic features, employing increasingly complex audio pipelines designed to be invariant to musical attributes that often vary widely across covers. While effective, these methods demand substantial training time and computational resources. By contrast, lyrics constitute a strong invariant across covers, though their use has been limited by the difficulty of extracting them accurately and efficiently from polyphonic audio. Early methods relied on simple frameworks that limited down- stream performance, while more recent systems deliver stronger results but require large models integrated within complex multimodal archi- tectures. We introduce LIVI (Lyrics-Informed Version Identification), an approach that seeks to balance retrieval accuracy with computational efficiency. First, LIVI leverages supervision from state-of-the-art tran- scription and text embedding models during training to achieve retrieval accuracy on par with—or superior to—harmonic-based systems. Second, LIVI remains lightweight and efficient by removing the transcription step at inference, challenging the dominance of complexity-heavy pipelines.

In the music information retrieval domain, an analogous task is Music Cover Retrieval—also known as Version Identification or Cover Detec- tion—where the goal is to recognize distinct renditions of the same underlying composition [49]. Robust systems are critical for catalog management, copyright enforcement, cross-platform track linking, and music retrieval [49]. Defining similarity between
