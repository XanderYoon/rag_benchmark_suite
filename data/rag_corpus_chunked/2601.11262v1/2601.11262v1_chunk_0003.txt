It delivers an efficient, reproducible3, and domain-grounded alternative, challenging the dominance of complexity-heavy multimodal systems. By design, our method applies only to tracks with sufficient vocal content, with a preprocessing stage used to exclude those lacking it. While this restriction narrows the scope of applicability, its practical impact is limited given the pre- dominance of vocal music in mainstream repertoires and its central role in indus- trial applications [11]. Moreover, a lyrics-informed approach such as LIVI could naturally be complemented by harmonic features, as in [46], forming part of a broader system that integrates both textual and musical cues. 3 Code available athttps://github.com/deezer/LIVI-Lyrics-Informed-Version-Identification Scalable Music Cover Retrieval Using Lyrics-Aligned Audio Embeddings 3 2 Related Works Version Identification.Research on Music Cover Retrieval has undergone sev- eral stages of development over the past two decades. Early systems based on hand-crafted features achieved encouraging results on small benchmarks, but failed to scale due to their reliance on costly alignment techniques such as dy- namic time warping (DTW) [33, 49]. The advent of deep learning marked a turning point, enabling data-driven feature learning from harmonic and melodic representations such as predominant melody, pitch class profiles (PCP), or the constant-Q transform (CQT) [50]. Since then, progress has followed two main di- rections: one line of work pushes towards increasingly deep architectures such as ResNet[2,15–18,26,30,41,53,54],whileanotheremphasizesmusicallyinformed inductive biases to achieve invariance to transformations such as transposition or structural changes [1, 13, 14, 50, 51]. Beyond these, multimodal methods that integrate complementary features have demonstrated clear advantages over unimodal models [1, 14, 15, 46]. Although lyrics offer a strong discriminative signal for version identifica- tion [1, 15, 31, 46], their integration into Music Cover Retrieval systems is rel- atively recent, primarily due to the
