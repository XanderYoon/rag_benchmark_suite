On SHS100k, Bytecover2 slightly outperforms LIVI, but this dif- ference can be partially explained by dataset characteristics: SHS100k includes a notable fraction of parodies, covers that preserve the melody but replace lyrics withironiccontent,whicharechallengingforourlyrics-centeredapproach.While differences on Covers80 and SHS100k are often not statistically significant, likely due to limited dataset sizes and ceiling effects across models, LIVI achieves sta- tistically significant improvements over all audio baselines across all metrics on the largest and most diverse benchmark Discogs-VI. Together, these results show that LIVI generalizes effectively to Music Cover Retrieval. It nearly matches the lyrics-based upper bound, clearly outperforms raw Whisper representations, and competes with or surpasses state-of-the-art audio baselines on vocal tracks. Its relatively simple and
