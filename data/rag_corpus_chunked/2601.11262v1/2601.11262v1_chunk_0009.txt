=αL cos + (1−α)L MSE, α∈[0,1] Unlike standard multimodal representation learning [20, 27, 48], which jointly trains both audio and text encoders to construct a joint embedding space, our method fixes the textual space and adapts only the audio encoder. This sub- tle difference allows the training process to exploit the geometry of the lyrics- informed embedding space directly, rather than relying on implicit structure induced by contrastive objectives and in-batch negatives. 4 Implementation Details of LIVI 4.1 Data Preprocessing Because transcription models are trained primarily on speech, they tend to hal- lucinate in non-vocal sections, generating spurious outputs despite the absence of linguistic content [6, 23, 28, 47]. A dedicated preprocessing stage is therefore introduced to filter out tracks with insufficient lyrical content and extract vocal- only segments. We employ a proprietary model deep learning model to estimate vocalness, as it yields more reliable predictions than Whisper’s integrated voice activity detection, which we found to suffer from lower transcription accuracy and frequent hallucinations (see Section 5.2). This model consists of the Musicnn architecture4 [34], augmented with a single linear layer of dimension 2 for binary classification. It estimates a vocalness probabilityvfor each non-overlapping 3s audio window, and a global vocalness score is obtained by averaging across all windows. Tracks with a score below a thresholdλ∈[0,1]are excluded to ensure sufficient lyrical content. Second, windows withv≥0.5are retained as vocal segments, concatenated into contiguous regions, and symmetrically padded by up to 10s to smooth temporal boundaries. The resulting segments are then trun- cated or zero-padded to a fixed length of 30s to match the input requirements 4 Model architecture and pretrained weights are available athttps://github.com/jordipons/musicnn.
