LIVI achieves sta- tistically significant improvements over all audio baselines across all metrics on the largest and most diverse benchmark Discogs-VI. Together, these results show that LIVI generalizes effectively to Music Cover Retrieval. It nearly matches the lyrics-based upper bound, clearly outperforms raw Whisper representations, and competes with or surpasses state-of-the-art audio baselines on vocal tracks. Its relatively simple and reproducible design contrasts with the complexity of models like ByteCover2, yet its performance across datasets establishes LIVI as a compact and powerful alternative. 5.5 Model Size and Inference A central motivation for LIVI was to circumvent the computational costs of Whisper’s autogressive decoding process. To quantify efficiency gains, we mea- sure end-to-end latency on200randomly sampled tracks from Discogs-VI, com- Fig. 3: Runtime and model size comparison.Average preprocessing and inference times are shown alongside model sizes for LIVI and baseline models.

For all models, we separatepreprocessing(audioloadingforaudiobaselines,plusvocaldetectionfor LIVI) from model inference (forward pass). We also report model size in terms of trainable parameters (Figure 3). The transcription pipeline requires on average 6.07s per track, with Whisper alone contributing4.41s. LIVI reduces total la- tency to1.90s, corresponding to a3.2×end-to-end speed-up. Where LIVI truly stands out is at the inference stage: its forward pass completes in0.22s, nearly 20×faster than Whisper and3–6×faster than audio baselines (0.66–1.40s). In addition, its latency variance is much lower (std.0.12vs.1.03–2.66), ensur- ing more predictable and stable performance. The main overhead instead arises from the preprocessing stage, where vocal detection and segmentation remain relatively costly compared to the inference of LIVI itself. Reducing this cost therefore represents an important direction for future work. Yet LIVI offers a favorable trade-off between complexity and accuracy when compared to base- lines. With31.9M
