at the track level suggest that the encoder integrates local cues into stable global representations, the results further demonstrate that our approach achieves tight audio-lyric alignment. 5.4 Application to Music Cover Retrieval We evaluate in Table 2 the audio encodergaudio on the retrieval task by comput- ing segment-level embeddingsa i =g audio(xi)for all vocal segmentsx i of each track (see Section 4.1) and aggregating them into a global representation. To dis- entangle the contributions of our method, we first use lyrics embeddings as an approximate upper bound, since LIVI is trained to project audio into this space: local embeddingst i =g text(xi)are averaged intotlocal, while global embeddings tglobal are computed from full transcriptions. As a second ablation, we introduce a Whisper baseline obtained by mean-pooling frame-level encoder states (Fig- ure 1.a); this removes the projection module and training stage, thereby isolating the effect of LIVI’s alignment beyond raw ASR features. Finally, we compare against state-of-the-art systems for version identification [2, 16, 41, 54]6, using official implementations and pretrained checkpoints from [41]. LIVI consistently outperforms lyrics embeddings derived from averaged local segmentsandapproaches—orevensurpasses—theupperbounddefinedbyglobal embeddings. Whisper embeddings, by contrast, yield poor performance across all datasets, underscoring the gains from LIVI’s architecture and training strategy. Through attention-based pooling and a projection network, Whisper’s outputs are effectively mapped into the lyrics-informed embedding space, producing rep- resentations sufficiently discriminative to recognize versions. Compared to audio baselines, LIVI delivers competitive or superior performance, with particularly 6 An evaluation against [31] was not performed due to concurrent publication timelines. 12 J.
