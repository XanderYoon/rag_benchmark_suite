mod- ern RAG system design. Current research has dedicated significant ef- forts to optimize the retrieval process in RAG sys- tems. Within them, Several approaches focus on multi-round retrieval iterations to obtain more com- prehensive and higher-quality content (Yao et al., 2023). Others employ task-specific or domain- adapted model fine-tuning to enhance performance in targeted scenarios. Alternative strategies involve implementing diversified retrieval techniques or ag- gregating information from heterogeneous sources (Huang et al., 2023). Chunk optimization strategies demonstrate effectiveness in improving retrieval re- sults by adjusting the chunk size (Sarthi et al., 2024) while mitigating risks of model performance degra- dation (Zhao et al., 2024). Despite these advance- ments in performance enhancement, RAG systems consistently encounter significant efficiency chal- lenges as knowledge bases expand. In the domain of large-scale data retrieval, Ap- proximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search attracts significant attention due to its capability to sub- stantially reduce search complexity under most scenarios (Do et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2017). Among ANN techniques (Luo et al., 2021), hash- ing methods emerged as one of the most widely adopted approaches, offering exceptional storage efficiency and rapid retrieval capabilities (Cantini et al., 2021). In particular, deep hashing methods (Xia et al., 2014) employ deep neural networks to learn discriminative feature representations and convert them into compact hash codes, substan- tially enhancing retrieval efficiency while reducing storage requirements and computational costs (Lai et al., 2015). Figure 1 illustrates a typical deep su- pervised hashing framework. This approach marks an unprecedented breakthrough in large-scale im- age retrieval and significantly outperforms conven- tional method (Chen et al., 2021), which also pro- vide a novel perspective for optimizing RAG effi- ciency. In the era of RAG, the knowledge bases signifi- cantly surpass traditional image retrieval datasets in scale and growth velocity. In light of this,
