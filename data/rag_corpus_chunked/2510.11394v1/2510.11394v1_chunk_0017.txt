detailed in Table 3 reveal significant insights. The removal of either the initial answer generation stage or the support- ing evidence selection stage induces a substantial decline in answer correctness. In contrast, the detrimental effect on citation quality resulting from these omissions is comparatively less pronounced. This observation indicates that statements originating from both stages possess a complementary nature, collectively contributing to the comprehensiveness of the final answer. Conversely, the ablation of the NLI verification module demonstrates a negligible impact on answer correctness. However, this removal causes a severe deterio- ration in citation quality. This finding underscores the critical role of the verification step in ensuring the reliability of the citations within the final answer.

Recognizing that general LLMs possess substantial natural language understanding capabilities, employing the same LLM to perform both answer generation and statement verification tasks within VeriCite offers a promising avenue for significantly reducing framework complexity. Consequently, we in- vestigate an integrated approach where a single LLM is tasked with generating answers and verifying the support for individual state- ments within retrieved passages. This verification is implemented by instructing the model to output a binary judgment (“Yes” or “No”) regarding whether each statement is supported by its correspond- ing passage. Furthermore, the experimental design incorporates the current SOTA LLM, DeepSeek-R1, specifically for the verification task.
