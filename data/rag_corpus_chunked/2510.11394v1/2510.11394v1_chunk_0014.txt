all baseline methods. Notably, the GLM-4 model delivers the most substantial improvement with a 4.54% increase in correctness over the best performing Vanilla baseline. Regarding citation quality, Llama3 and Qwen2.5 models achieve significant enhancements in citation F1, surpassing the strongest baseline. In contrast, Gemma-2 and GLM-4 perform marginally below their respective optimal baselines in this metric. For the ELI5 dataset, VeriCite underperforms relative to the more robust baselines in answer correctness across all five models, indi- cating potential limitations in its answer generation mechanism for non-factoid questions. It is noteworthy that the extensively fine-tuned APO baseline demonstrates strong correctness here, exhibiting only minor degradation with the GLM-4 model. Con- versely, VeriCite achieves substantial gains in citation quality, with all five models exceeding the best baseline by an average margin of 11.41% in Citation F1 score, thereby validating its efficacy for citation optimization. On multi-hop QA datasets, VeriCite shows a pronounced im- provement in answer correctness exclusively with the Qwen2.5 model, which surpasses all other baselines. However, its perfor- mance with the remaining three models falls slightly below their respective best baselines. This observation suggests that VeriCite’s supporting evidence selection stage may be suboptimal for multi- hop scenarios requiring cross-passage information integration, highlighting a potential area for architectural refinement. Despite this, all models exhibit exceptional citation quality, significantly outperforming the strongest baselines in Citation F1 scores. Overall, the results indicate that VeriCite matches or exceeds the best baselines in answer correctness, with particularly notable gains observed for the Qwen2.5 and GLM-4 models. Simultaneously, citation quality was significantly enhanced across all five models compared to the best baseline performances. Furthermore, both parameter scales of the Qwen2.5 model exhibited similar improve- ments, suggesting that the proposed method retains its potential for application to larger-scale models. 5 Analysis 5.1 Ablation Study This section presents
