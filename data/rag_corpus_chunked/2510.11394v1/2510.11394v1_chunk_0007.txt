(Supported, Insufficient, Contradictory, Irrelevant) for fine-grained attribution evaluation, enabling more precise quantification of attribution performance. 3 VeriCite framework 3.1 Task Formulation Following previous work [8, 20], the formal description of this task is as follows: Given a query 𝑞, top-𝑘 passages 𝑃={𝑝 1, 𝑝2, . . . , 𝑝𝑘 } are retrieved, and the LLM needs to generate an answer 𝐴. The answer 𝐴 consists of several statements 𝐴={𝑠 1, 𝑠2, . . .} . Each statement 𝑠𝑖 may cite a set of passages 𝐶𝑖 ={𝑐 𝑖1, 𝑐𝑖2, . . .} , where 𝑐𝑖 𝑗 ∈ [1, 𝑘] ∩Z. 3.2 Initial Answer Generation The initial answer generation phase follows standard RAG method- ology [16], where the query 𝑞 and all top- 𝑘 retrieved passages {𝑝1, 𝑝2, . . . , 𝑝𝑘 } are concatenated into a single input sequence for the LLM, producing an initial answer𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡_𝑎𝑛𝑠. 𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡_𝑎𝑛𝑠=𝐴𝑛𝑠𝑤𝑒𝑟(𝑞, 𝑝 1, 𝑝2, . . . , 𝑝𝑘 )(1) At this stage, we employ a few-shot instruction template to provide in-context learning examples, guiding the LLM to learn the citation patterns demonstrated in the exemplars. This approach explicitly requires the model to incorporate citations within each answer statement. The instruction template at this stage is shown in Appendix A.1. This phase aims to produce a foundational answer for subsequent refinement, requiring only citation incorporation without additional model constraints. While contemporary LLMs excel at answering simple commonsense queries, they inevitably exhibit hallucination tendencies when confronted with complex problems. To enhance answer reliability, we implement a rigorous verifi- cation and filtering mechanism. During initial answer validation, unsupported content must be systematically eliminated, retaining exclusively evidence-substantiated answer statements. To facili- tate granular reliability verification, the initial answer 𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡_𝑎𝑛𝑠 is decomposed into a set of statements {𝑠1, 𝑠2, . . .} , where each statement 𝑠𝑖 is
