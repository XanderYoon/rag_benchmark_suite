with particularly notable gains observed for the Qwen2.5 and GLM-4 models. Simultaneously, citation quality was significantly enhanced across all five models compared to the best baseline performances. Furthermore, both parameter scales of the Qwen2.5 model exhibited similar improve- ments, suggesting that the proposed method retains its potential for application to larger-scale models. 5 Analysis 5.1 Ablation Study This section presents an ablation study conducted on the VeriCite framework to evaluation the contribution of its core components. Experiments were performed using the Llama3-8B-Instruct model on the ASQA dataset. Three specific ablation variants were investigated. The first vari- ant omits the initial answer generation stage; consequently, the final answer is generated exclusively utilizing statements derived from the supporting evidence selection stage. The second variant removes the supporting evidence selection stage, with the final answer organized solely based on statements obtained from the initial answer generation stage. The third variant eliminates the NLI based verification module employed in both the initial answer generation and supporting evidence selection stages. Under this condition, all generated statements are assumed to be supported SIGIR-AP 2025, December 7–10, 2025, Xi’an, China Haosheng et al.
