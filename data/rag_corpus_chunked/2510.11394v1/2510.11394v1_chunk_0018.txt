is supported by its correspond- ing passage. Furthermore, the experimental design incorporates the current SOTA LLM, DeepSeek-R1, specifically for the verification task. The comparative evaluation utilized the Llama3-8B-Instruct model exclusively for answer generation and evaluated the effec- tiveness of these three distinct verifier configurations—namely, the VeriCite: Towards Reliable Citations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Rigorous Verification SIGIR-AP 2025, December 7–10, 2025, Xi’an, China LLM verifier, the DeepSeek-R1 verifier, and the NLI verifier—on a randomly selected subset of 200 samples from the ASQA dataset. Experimental results present in Table 4. Utilizing a general LLM for dual-role verification proved detrimental, leading to a noticeable decline in both answer correctness and citation quality relative to the NLI verifier. In contrast, the DeepSeek-R1 verifier achieved a marginal improvement in answer correctness compared to the NLI verifier, while its impact on citation quality was nearly equivalent. In terms of computational efficiency, while the LLM and NLI veri- fiers are comparable in both parameter sizes and operational costs, their practical deployment costs are substantially lower than those of the large-scale DeepSeek-R1 model. Therefore, based on this empirical evaluation balancing perfor- mance gains against resource expenditure, selecting the NLI model for the verification role emerges as the optimal choice, offering an effective and cost-efficient solution. 6 Conclusion In this paper, we propose VeriCite, a novel framework designed to enhance citation quality in RAG systems. The framework operates through three sequential stages: initial answer generation, support- ing evidence selection, and final answer refinement. Experimental results demonstrate that VeriCite significantly enhances citation quality while maintaining answer correctness comparable to the strongest baseline methods. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm the necessity of each core component within the framework. Addi- tionally, the paper discusses the critical importance of selecting a NLI model for the verification role, providing justification for this design choice. Acknowledgments
