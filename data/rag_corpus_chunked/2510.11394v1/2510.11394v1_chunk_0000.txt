Despite the impres- sive performance in complex question-answering tasks, RAG still struggles with hallucinations. Attributing RAG-generated content through in-line citations has demonstrated potential in reducing hallucinations and facilitating human verification. Existing citation generation methods primarily rely on either fine-tuning the genera- tor or employing post-processing approaches for citation matching. However, the former approach demands substantial annotated data and computational resources, while the latter often encounters dif- ficulties in managing multiple citations and frequently produces suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework, calledVeriCite, designed to rigorously validate supporting evi- dence and enhance answer attribution. Specifically,VeriCitebreaks down into a three-stage generation: 1) Theinitial answer generation first generates a response based on all available contexts and has its claims verified through the NLI model; 2) thesupporting evidence selectionassesses the utility of each document and extracts useful supporting evidences; 3) thefinal answer refinementintegrates the initial response and collected evidences to produce the final, refined answer. We conduct experiments across five open-sourceLLMs and four datasets, demonstrating that VeriCite can significantly improve
