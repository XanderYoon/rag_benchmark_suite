and final answer refinement. Experimental results demonstrate that VeriCite significantly enhances citation quality while maintaining answer correctness comparable to the strongest baseline methods. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm the necessity of each core component within the framework. Addi- tionally, the paper discusses the critical importance of selecting a NLI model for the verification role, providing justification for this design choice.
