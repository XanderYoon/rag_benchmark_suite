confronted with complex problems. To enhance answer reliability, we implement a rigorous verifi- cation and filtering mechanism. During initial answer validation, unsupported content must be systematically eliminated, retaining exclusively evidence-substantiated answer statements. To facili- tate granular reliability verification, the initial answer 𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡_𝑎𝑛𝑠 is decomposed into a set of statements {𝑠1, 𝑠2, . . .} , where each statement 𝑠𝑖 is associated with a potentially empty set of cita- tions {𝑐𝑖1, 𝑐𝑖2, . . .} . The verification process employs a NLI model 𝜙 trained for Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) tasks [2, 41], which predicts whether a hypothesis is entailed by, contradicts, or is neutral to given premises. Specifically, for each statement𝑠𝑖, we validate whether the corresponding retrieval passages {𝑝𝑐𝑖 𝑗 } (premises) entail the statement𝑠 𝑖 (hypothesis). 𝑠𝑢𝑝𝑖 =𝜙(𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑎𝑡(𝑝 𝑐𝑖 𝑗 ), 𝑠𝑖 )(2) The verification outcome 𝑠𝑢𝑝𝑖 is binary-valued: when the model determines that the answer statement 𝑠𝑖 is entailed by (a combina- tion of) the retrieved passages, 𝑠𝑢𝑝𝑖 is assignedTrue; otherwise, it returnsFalse, indicating an unsupported statement likely contain- ing hallucinated content that consequently fails verification and must be discarded. 3.3 Supporting Evidence Selection Irrelevant information can interfere with theLLM’s response gener- ation, potentially causing critical relevant details to be overlooked. While conventional RAG approaches generate answers based on coarsely aggregated retrieval results, our methodology addition- ally incorporates fine-grained evidence extraction.
