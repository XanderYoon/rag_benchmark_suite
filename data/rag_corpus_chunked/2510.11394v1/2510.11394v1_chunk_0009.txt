These distinct models often exhibit mutually incompatible relevance judgments. Retrievers may introduce either irrelevant information or seemingly relevant but non-actionable content, both of which can cause gen- erators to overlook genuinely critical information while producing noise-degraded outputs. Inspired by recent studies [ 26, 28, 33], our evidence selection phase leverages the LLM’s robust natural language understanding capabilities to collaborate with the retriever in context extraction. This dual engagement strategy comprehensively excavates poten- tially valuable content that might otherwise be overlooked within each passage. Specifically, the LLM first independently evaluates each retrieved passage’s utility for answering the query using the instruction template depicted in Appendix A.2. 𝑟𝑒𝑙 𝑖 =𝐶ℎ𝑒𝑐𝑘(𝑞, 𝑝 𝑖 )(3) Following the LLM’s secondary verification of passage utility, retained passages (𝑟𝑒𝑙 𝑖 =𝑇 𝑟𝑢𝑒 ) proceed to evidence selection. The generator then independently produces answers for each qualifying passage𝑝 𝑖 using the instruction template shown in Appendix A.3. 𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑖 =  𝐴𝑛𝑠𝑤𝑒𝑟(𝑞, 𝑝 𝑖 ), 𝑟𝑒𝑙 𝑖 =𝑇 𝑟𝑢𝑒 𝑁 𝑜𝑛𝑒 , 𝑟𝑒𝑙 𝑖 =𝐹𝑎𝑙𝑠𝑒 (4) Like other texts generated by LLMs, 𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑖 remains prone to hallucination issues, necessitating further verification of its en- tailment relationship with the corresponding original passage 𝑝𝑖. Similar to the previous phase, the verification process decomposes 𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑖 into statements {𝑠𝑖1, 𝑠𝑖2, . . .} . We then employ the NLI model 𝜙 to verify whether the original retrieval passage entails these statements. 𝑠𝑢𝑝𝑖 𝑗 =𝜙(𝑝 𝑖, 𝑠𝑖
