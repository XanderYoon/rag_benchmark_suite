remains prone to hallucination issues, necessitating further verification of its en- tailment relationship with the corresponding original passage 𝑝𝑖. Similar to the previous phase, the verification process decomposes 𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑖 into statements {𝑠𝑖1, 𝑠𝑖2, . . .} . We then employ the NLI model 𝜙 to verify whether the original retrieval passage entails these statements. 𝑠𝑢𝑝𝑖 𝑗 =𝜙(𝑝 𝑖, 𝑠𝑖 𝑗)(5) Statements 𝑠𝑖 𝑗 verified by the NLI model as entailed by passage 𝑝𝑖 are retained for subsequent summarization and automatically annotated with the corresponding citation marker “[i]”. This design fundamentally decouples attribution from generation during the summarization phase. Final answer citations directly reuse these pre-process markers rather than relying on the generator’s attri- bution capabilities, thereby significantly reducing demands on the LLM’s citation capacity. 3.4 Final Answer Refinement Following rigorous collection and verification procedures in the preceding stages, we obtain a curated set of semantically validated statements {𝑠1, 𝑠2, . . .} accompanied by their corresponding citation sets {𝑐1 ={𝑐 11, 𝑐12, . . .}, 𝑐 2 ={𝑐 21, 𝑐22, . . .}, . . .} . While these com- ponents exhibit high reliability due to rigorous verification, their inherent fragmentation and potential redundancy render them un- suitable for direct concatenation into a coherent final response. The refinement phase fundamentally redefines the large language model’s role rather than directly addressing the query or making at- tribution decisions, the model now functions as a synthesis engine. This engine processes the verified statements and citations as foun- dational input material, executing three critical transformations: restructuring logical flow and sentence sequencing to enhance co- herence, eliminating redundant content to improve conciseness, and strategically consolidating citations to optimize referential clarity. 𝑓 𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙_𝑎𝑛𝑠=𝑅𝑒 𝑓 𝑖𝑛𝑒(𝑞, 𝑃, 𝑠 1, 𝑐1, 𝑠2, 𝑐2, . . .)(6) To mitigate potential referential ambiguity and ensure contex- tual fidelity,
