extraction process. Through these steps of customizing and applying OpenSPG’s prompts, we achieve efficient knowledge extraction. 1https://github.com/OpenSPG/openspg 2https://openspg.yuque.com/ Fig. 4: Example of multi-source line graph transformation The following formula describes the data extraction process: KB = X Di ({e1, e2, ..., em} G {r1, r2, ..., rn}) (3) C. Homologous Subgraph Matching After the preliminary extraction of information, the next step is to identify the multi-source homologous data group set SV s and the isolated point set LVs. This process begins by initializing the unvisited node set Uunvisited = V, while setting the homologous data group SV s = ∅ and the isolated point set LVs = ∅. By traversing all nodes and retrieving node information from various domains, for matched homologous data, construct the homologous node sgi and its corresponding associated edge ei, and add them to the homologous node set Usg and edge set Esg, respectively. After the traversal, add (Usg, Esg) to SV s. If no homologous data is obtained after one round of traversal, add the node to the isolated point set LVs. After the traversal is completed, the node will be removed from the Uunvisited set. The time complexity of homologous subgraph matching is O(n log n), where n is the number of nodes in the knowledge graph G. For each homologous subgraph in SV s, homologous linear knowledge subgraph subSG ′i is constructed by utilizing the homologous node set Usg and the homologous edge set Esg. Subsequently, all subSG ′i and the isolated point set LVs are aggregated to obtain the homologous linear knowledge graph SG′. It should be noted that SG′ is solely used for consistency checks and retrieval queries of homologous data; other types of queries still conducts operations on the original knowledge graph G. Here, we provide a simple example of
