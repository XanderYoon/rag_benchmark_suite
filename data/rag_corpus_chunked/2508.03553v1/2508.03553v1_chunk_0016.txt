Answers (Cnodes, GA) 8: return Answer 9: end procedure where α is a weight coefficient that balances the contributions of LLM-assessed authority and historical authority, satisfying 0 ≤ α ≤ 1. Benefiting from the calculation idea of knowledge credibil- ity in the PTCA [33], AuthLLM(v) is assessed by the global influence and local connection strength of the node. The LLM can comprehensively calculate the credibility of knowledge by integrating the association strength between entities, entity type information, and multi-step path information. AutmLLM (v) = 1 1 + e−β·CLLM (v) (10) where CLLM(v) is the authority score provided by the LLM for node v is the average value of all nodes’ CLLM(v), and β is a parameter that controls the steepness of the scoring curve. c) Historical Authority: Authhist(v) is an authority score based on the node’s historical data. Inspired by Zhu’s work [34], we expect to use the credibility of historical data sources and current query-related data for incremental estimation. Authhist(v) = H · P rh(D) + P υp∈Dυ[q] P r(υp) H + |Data(q, subSG′i)| (11) where H is the number of entities provided by data source D for all historical queries, P rh(D) is the historical credibility of data source D, Dυ[q] is the set of correct answers, and Data(q, subSG′i) is the query-related data obtained from the multi-source line subgraph. Ultimately, we designed the multi-level confidence comput- ing algorithm, MCC, to calculate the credibility of the data sources in the homologous subgraph, ensuring the quality of the knowledge graph embedded in the LLM. The algorithm is shown in Algorithm1. It should be noted that the MCC algorithm does not directly provide the final graph confidence and node confidence; these values must be obtained through prompt to achieve the ulti- mate results. E.
