in Table III, MLG construction introduces modest preprocessing time (12.7s- 39.2s) while delivering 10-100× query acceleration. Specifi- cally, the flight dataset shows QT reduction from computa- tional infeasibility (marked NAN) to 29.8s through MLG’s compact structure. Concurrently, MKA sustains consistent accuracy improvements. Removing MKA causes F1 drops of 7.3% on Movies and 9.6% on Books, demonstrating MLG’s effectiveness in connecting fragmented knowledge across sources. The MCC module exhibits more significant effects on performance and hallucination control. Disabling MCC causes drastic F1 degradation of 20.1% on Movies and 33.2% on Stocks, with PT values indicating increased hallucination risks. This validates MCC’s critical role in eliminating unreliable information through hierarchical confidence computation. b) Hierarchical Analysis of MCC: Stratified ablation reveals the complementary roles of graph-level and node-level computations. For Movies (J/K/C configuration), removing graph-level filtering reduces F1 to 48.1% (+13.4% vs MCC- disabled) with QT increasing to 75.6s (+93% vs full frame- work). Conversely, disabling node-level computation yields 41.5% F1 (+6.8% vs baseline), showing graph-level filtering alone cannot resolve local conflicts. The complete MCC framework achieves 54.8% F1 by synergistically combining both layers. Error analysis shows distinct failure patterns: 38.7% errors under graph-level removal (Movies J/K) stem from cross- source inconsistencies, while 52.7% failures with node-level removal (Books J/C/X) originate from local authority issues. This confirms the functional specialization—graph-level en- sures global consistency, node-level verifies local credibility. Fig.7 demonstrates that an optimal balance between effi- ciency and accuracy is achieved at α = 0.5, where the hybrid weighting of LLM-assessed authority and historical authority peaks with an F1 score of 67.7% and balanced query time. Specifically, increasing α towards 1.0, which emphasizes the LLM, reduces query time from 83.2 seconds ( α = 0.0) to 51.8 seconds ( α = 1 .0) by minimizing historical data validation. Conversely, the F1 score follows
