[23] constructs offline memory graphs with a neural indexing mechanism, decreasing retrieval latency to one-eighth of traditional methods. While ToG 2.0 [25] further advances this field by introducing a graph-context co-retrieval framework that dynamically balances structured and unstruc- tured evidence, resulting in a 29% reduction in hallucination rates compared to unimodal approaches. Unlike prior approaches that primarily focus on unimodal confidence calculations, MultiRAG achieves superior halluci- nation mitigation through the adaptive filtering of conflicting subgraphs (GCC module) while maintaining multi-domain logical associations via its novel knowledge aggregation mech- anism (MKA module). B. Heterogeneous Graph Fusion for RAG The fusion of multi-source heterogeneous data relies on advanced graph representation techniques. FusionQuery [34] enhances cross-domain retrieval precision by integrating het- erogeneous graphs and computing dynamic credibility evalu- ations. The Triple Line Graph [31] addresses the challenge of knowledge fragmentation by systematically aggregating cross- domain relationships, leading to Multi-source Line Graph proposed in this paper. Additionally, leveraging the structured representation advantages of KAG [26] in knowledge-guided retrieval, we achieve a unified representation approach for multi-source KGs, underscoring the importance of heteroge- neous graph fusion in real-world applications. C. Hallucination Benchmark and Confidence-Aware Comput- ing The evaluation of hallucinations in LLMs and associated confidence calculation methods are crucial for mitigating hallucinations. HaluEval [49] offers 5,000 annotated samples across five error categories, but lacks granularity for relational hallucinations. RefChecker [50] implements triple decomposi- tion for fine-grained detection, improving precision by 26.1% over sentence-level methods. RAGTruth [51] contains nearly 18,000 RAG-generated responses with detailed manual annota- tions including word-level hallucination intensities. However, diverse and complex data sources continue to challenge exist- ing evaluation frameworks. VI. CONCLUSION In this work, we introduce MultiRAG, a framework de- signed to mitigate hallucination in multi-source knowledge- augmented generation. To address hallucinations arising from data sparsity and inconsistency, we propose two
