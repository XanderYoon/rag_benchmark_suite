= {d, name, c, meta} exists, where d represents the domain of data, c represents the content of the data file, name represents the file/attribute name, and meta represents the file metadata. Through a multi-source data fusion algorithm, we can obtain normalized data ˆD = {id, d, name, jsc, meta, (cols index)}. Here, id represents the unique identifier for normalization, d indicates the domain where the data file is located, name denotes the data file name, meta denotes the file metadata, and jsc denotes the file content stored using JSON-LD. If the stored data is structured data or other data formats that can use a columnar storage model, the column index cols index of all attributes will also be stored for rapid retrieval and query. Fig. 2 provides an example of JSON-LD format. Definition 2. Multi-source line graph [31]. Given a multi- source knowledge graph G and a transformed knowledge graph G′ (multi-source line graph, MLG), the MLG satisfies the following characteristics: 1) A node in G′ represents a triplet. 2) There is an associated edge between any two nodes in G′ if and only if the triples represented by these two nodes share a common node. Based on the definition, it can be inferred that MLG achieves high aggregation of related nodes, which can greatly improve the efficiency of data retrieval and accelerate subse- quent retrieval and query algorithms. Definition 3. Multi-source homologous data . For any two nodes υ1 and υ2 in G, they are defined as multi-source homologous if and only if they belong to the same retrieval candidate set in a single search. Definition 4. Homologous node and homologous sub- graph. Given a set of mult-domain homologous data SV = {υi}n i=1 in the knowledge graph G, we define the homologous center node as snode =
