LLM Context Trusted: CA981.Status=Delayed (0.89), DelayReason=Typhoon (0.85)Conflicts: ForumUser123:On-time (0.47), WeatherAPI:Clear (0.52) Final Answer Correct: ”CA981 delayed until after 14:30 due to typhoon” Hallucinated: ”CA981on-time with possible delay after 14:30” methodology enhances robustness against data sparsity and noise, particularly in the Books and Stocks datasets. Fig. 7: Influence of hyperparameter α on multi-source retrieval Q4: How is the performance of MultiRAG in multi-hop Q&A datasets after incorporating multi-level confidence calculation? To assess the validity of the multi-level confidence com- puting method in reducing hallucinations generated by large models and enhancing the credibility of Q&A systems, we compare the Recall@5 scores of different methods on the HotpotQA and 2WikiMultiHopQA datasets. The outcome of Table IV indicates that the multi-level confidence computing method not only demonstrates a higher average Recall@5 score but also maintains a lower standard deviation compared to traditional methods. This suggests that the multi-level confidence computing method is more con- sistent in its performance across different queries, leading to fewer hallucinations and more reliable Q&A responses. The lower standard deviation is a testament to the robustness of the mechanism in handling the variability in data and the complexity of the queries. Furthermore, we performed a detailed error analysis to iden- tify the types and frequency of hallucinations in the responses generated by the different methods. The results showed that the multi-level confidence computing method significantly reduced the frequency of hallucinations, particularly in the cases where the context was ambiguous or the information was not readily available in the knowledge base. Q5: What are the time costs of the two modules in MultiRAG? Intuitively, MLG aggregates homologous data from several sources, ensuring the density of the retrieval subgraphs without the need to traverse and store an excessive number of invalid nodes, thereby significantly reducing the time cost associated with traversing and
