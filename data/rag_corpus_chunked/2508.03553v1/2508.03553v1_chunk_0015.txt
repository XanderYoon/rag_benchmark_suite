We use mutual information entropy to calculate the similarity between node pairs, thereby assessing consistency. For a node v, its consistency score can be expressed as: Sn(v) = 1 |N (v)| X u∈N (v) S(v, u) (8) where N (v) is the set of nodes with the same attributes as node v, and S(v, u) is the similarity between nodes v and u as defined in Equation 5. b) Node Authority Score: Authority score is divided into two parts: the node’s authority assessed by the LLM and the node’s historical authority. This score reflects the importance and authenticity of the node. Additionally, we use an expert LLM to comprehensively evaluate the authority of the node. The node’s authority score A(v) can be calculated using the following formula: A(v) = α · AuthLLM (v) + (1 − α) · Authhist(v) (9) Algorithm 2 Multi-source Knowledge Line Graph Prompting 1: procedure MKLGP( q) 2: Eq, Rq ← Logic Form Generation (q) 3: Dq ← Multi Document Extraction (Vq) 4: SG ′ ← Prompt(Dq) 5: SV s, LVs ← MCC(SG ′, q, Dq) 6: Cnodes, GA ← Prompt(SV s, LVs) 7: Answer ← Generating Trustworthy Answers (Cnodes, GA) 8: return Answer 9: end procedure where α is a weight coefficient that balances the contributions of LLM-assessed authority and historical authority, satisfying 0 ≤ α ≤ 1. Benefiting from the calculation idea of knowledge credibil- ity in the PTCA [33], AuthLLM(v) is assessed by the global influence and local connection strength of the node. The LLM
