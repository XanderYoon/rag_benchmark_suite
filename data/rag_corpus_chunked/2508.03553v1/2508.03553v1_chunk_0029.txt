= 0.5, where the hybrid weighting of LLM-assessed authority and historical authority peaks with an F1 score of 67.7% and balanced query time. Specifically, increasing α towards 1.0, which emphasizes the LLM, reduces query time from 83.2 seconds ( α = 0.0) to 51.8 seconds ( α = 1 .0) by minimizing historical data validation. Conversely, the F1 score follows a non-monotonic pattern, reaching its maximum at α = 0.5 before declining as reliance on either the LLM or historical data becomes excessive. This equilibrium leverages the LLM’s contextual adaptability (AuthLLM) while maintaining the stability of expert systems (Authhist), as evidenced by a 62.4% reduction in errors during ablation studies when both components are utilized. By avoid- ing complete dependence on the LLM ( α ̸= 1.0) and integrat- ing probabilistic LLM inferences with deterministic historical patterns through multi-level confidence computing (Eq.9), the TABLE V: Case Study Query: ”What is the real-time status of Air China flight CA981 from Beijing Capital International Airport (PEK) to New York John F.
