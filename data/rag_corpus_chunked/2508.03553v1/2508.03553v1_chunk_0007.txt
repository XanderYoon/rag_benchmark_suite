υ1 and υ2 in G, they are defined as multi-source homologous if and only if they belong to the same retrieval candidate set in a single search. Definition 4. Homologous node and homologous sub- graph. Given a set of mult-domain homologous data SV = {υi}n i=1 in the knowledge graph G, we define the homologous center node as snode = {name, meta, num, C(v)}, the set of homologous nodes as Usnode, and the set of homologous edges as Esnode. Here, name represents the common attribute name, meta denotes the identical file metadata, num indicates the number of homologous data instances, and C(v) represents the data confidence. We define the association edge between snode and υi as ei = {wi}n i=1, where wi represents the weight Fig. 2: Data format of JSON-LD of node υi in the data confidence calculation. Thus, the ho- mologous center node and SG together form the homologous subgraph subSG. Definition 5. Homologous triple line graph . For all homologous subgraphs within the knowledge graph G, they collectively constitute the homologous knowledge graph SG. By performing a linear graph transformation on the homolo- gous knowledge graph, we obtain the homologous triple line graph SG′. By constructing a homologous triple line graph, multi- source homologous data are aggregated into a single sub- graph, centered around homologous nodes, enabling rapid consistency checks and conflict feedback for homologous data. Additionally, the knowledge graph contains a significant number of isolated nodes (i.e., nodes without homologous data), which are also incorporated into the homologous triple line graph. Definition 6. Candidate graph confidence and candidate node confidence. For a query Q(q, G) on the knowledge graph G, the corresponding Homologous line graph SG′ is obtained. The candidate graph confidence is an estimation of the con- fidence in the candidate Homologous subgraph, assessing the
