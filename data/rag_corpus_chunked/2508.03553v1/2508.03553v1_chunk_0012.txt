set Esg. Subsequently, all subSG ′i and the isolated point set LVs are aggregated to obtain the homologous linear knowledge graph SG′. It should be noted that SG′ is solely used for consistency checks and retrieval queries of homologous data; other types of queries still conducts operations on the original knowledge graph G. Here, we provide a simple example of a homologous triple line graph. As shown in Fig. 4, a homologous node is asso- ciated with 4 homologous data points. After transformation into a triple line graph, it forms a complete graph of order 4, indicating that the four triples are pairwise homologous. D. Multi-level Confidence Computing We define the candidate data from different domains ob- tained in a single retrieval as multi-source homologous data. These data have been extracted into a homologous line graph for temporary storage. Although targeting the same query object, they often provide inconsistent reference answers. Con- sidering the varying retrieval errors, the multi-level confidence calculation method is adpoted in this framework. First, the confidence of individual homologous line graphs is calculated, followed by the confidence of each candidate node, to deter- mine the final set of answer candidates. 1) Graph-Level Confidence Computing: In the first stage, a confidence calculation method based on mutual information entropy is introduced to assess the confidence of homologous line graphs. The core idea of this method is that if two nodes with the same attributes in a homologous line graph are close in content, their similarity is high, and thus their confidence is also high; conversely, if they are not, their confidence is low. Let G be a homologous line graph, and N (G) be the set of nodes in the graph. For any two nodes vi, vj ∈ N (G) with the same attributes, the similarity S(vi, vj)
