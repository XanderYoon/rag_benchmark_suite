The same applies to the following text. 1) TruthFinder(TF) [37]: the classic iterative data fusion method. 2) LTM [42]: the probabilistic data fusion method. 3) CoT [43] is a foundational approach that involves step- by-step reasoning to reach a conclusion, we use GPT- 3.5-Turbo as the base model. 4) Standard RAG [2] is a method that combines the strengths of retrieval and generation models to answer questions. Moreover, we also summerize these SOTA methods below: • IRCoT [44] is an advanced method that refines the reasoning process through iterative retrieval. • ChatKBQA [45] is a conversational interface-based method for knowledge base question answering. • MDQA [46] is a method designed to extract answers from multiple documents effectively. • FusionQuery [34] is a SOTA method based on the efficient on-demand fusion query framework. • RQ-RAG [47] is a method that integrates external
