MultiRAG integrated three data formats: structured departure schedules, semi-structured delay codes from airline systems, and unstructured weather alerts. The MKA mod- ule extracted key relationships (flight-delay-typhoon) with a confidence score of 0.87. Subsequently, the MCC module resolved conflicts through hierarchical verification by filter- ing out low-reliability sources, such as user forums (con- fidence score of 0.47), while prioritizing data from air- lines (confidence score of 0.89) and weather reports. This dual-layer validation—combining automated threshold checks (graph confidence of 0.71) with LLM-simulated expert reason- ing—enabled the precise reconciliation of contradictory depar- ture time claims. Ultimately, the system generated the verified conclusion, ”Delayed until after 14:30 due to typhoon,” while suppressing the inconsistent ”on-time” report. E. Restrictive Analysis Lastly but not least, we acknowledge several limitations inherent in our current framework. 1) Lack of optimization of text chunk segmentation. 2) Reliance on LLM-based expert evaluation, which may introduce potential security vulnerabilities. 3) Focuses on eliminating factual hallucinations but lacks handling of symbolic hallucinations. V. R ELATED WORK A. Graph-Structured Approaches for Hallucination Mitigation Recent advancements have demonstrated unique advantages of graph structures in mitigating hallucinations within RAG systems. MetaRAG [9] establishes knowledge association ver- ification through meta-cognitive graph reasoning paths, en- hancing self-correction mechanisms in multi-hop QA. Graph- CoT [48] innovatively leverages Graph Neural Networks to establish bidirectional connections between KGs and the latent space of LLMs. In result, it reduces factual inconsistencies by 37% on KGQA benchmarks. Inspired by neurobiology, HippoRAG [23] constructs offline memory graphs with a neural indexing mechanism, decreasing retrieval latency to one-eighth of traditional methods. While ToG 2.0 [25] further advances this field by introducing a graph-context co-retrieval framework that dynamically balances structured and unstruc- tured evidence, resulting in a 29% reduction in hallucination rates compared to unimodal approaches. Unlike prior approaches that primarily focus on unimodal
