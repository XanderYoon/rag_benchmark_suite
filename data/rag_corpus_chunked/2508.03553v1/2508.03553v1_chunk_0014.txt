average simi- larity S(vi, vj) of all node pairs in the graph: C(G) = 1 |N (G)|2 − |N (G)| X vi∈N (G) X vj ∈N (G) j̸=i S(vi, vj) (7) where |N (G)| denotes the number of nodes in the graph. Notably, a homologous line graph exhibiting high confi- dence demonstrates that its constituent nodes maintain strong attribute-level consistency across their content representations. 2) Node-Level Confidence Computing: In the second phase, the confidence of individual node C(v) is calculated, which takes into account the node’s consistency, authority, and his- torical confidence. The following are the detailed calculation methods and formulas.

We use mutual information entropy to calculate the similarity between node pairs,
