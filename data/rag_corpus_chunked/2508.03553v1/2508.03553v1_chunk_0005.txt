In the field of Knowledge-Guided RAG, the primary chal- lenges include efficiently accessing relevant knowledge and achieving reliable retrieval performance. This section intro- duces the core elements of our approach and precisely defines the problems we address. Let Q = {q1, q2, . . . , qn} be the set of query instances, where each qi corresponds to a distinct query. Let E = {e1, e2, . . . , em} be the set of entities in the knowledge graph, where each ej represents an entity. Let R = {r1, r2, . . . , rp} be the set of relationships in the knowledge graph, where each rk represents a relationship. Let D = {d1, d2, . . . , dt} be the set of documents, where each dl represents a document. We define the knowledge-guided retrieval enhancement generation problem as follows: arg max di∈D LLM (qi, di), X ej ∈E X rk∈R KG(ej, rk, di) (1) where LLM (qi, dl) denotes the score of the relevance be- tween query qi and document dl assessed by the LLM, and KG(ej, rk, dl) represents the degree of match between entity ej, relationship rk, and document dl. Furthermore, we optimize the knowledge construction and retrieval modules by introducing multi-source line graphs to accelerate knowledge establishment and enhance retrieval robustness. Specifically, the proposed approach is formally defined as follows: Definition 1. Multi-source data fusion. Given a set of sources H, the data D = {d, name, c, meta} exists, where d represents the domain of data, c represents the content of the data file, name represents the file/attribute name, and meta represents the file metadata. Through a multi-source data fusion algorithm, we can obtain normalized data ˆD = {id, d, name, jsc, meta, (cols index)}. Here, id represents the unique identifier for normalization,
