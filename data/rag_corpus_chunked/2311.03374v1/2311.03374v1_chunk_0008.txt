match to find similar words. Vector Space Representations: Code and comments belong- to different semantic granularity which is unified by a vector space representation. The participants have used various pre-trained embeddings to generate vectors for the words like those based on one hot encoding, tf-idf based, word2vec or context aware like ELMo and BERT. Each of the employed embedding models are trained or finetuned using software development corpora. Results: The participants are able to achieve a slight increase (in the range of 2%-4%) in the test prediction metrics and in many cases the performance decrease. However, the increase in bias due to the incorporation of silver standard data reduces the over-fitting of the models.

Conclusions The IRSE 2023 track empirically investigates the feasibility of augmenting existing classification models using datasets with labels generated from LLM’s. A total of 17 teams participated and submitted 56 experiments that used various types of machine learning models, embedding spaces, features and different LLMs to generate data. The LLM-generated labels reduce the overfitting of the overall classification model and also improve the F1 score when the combined data from all participants were used to augment the existing data with gold standard labels from industry practitioners.
