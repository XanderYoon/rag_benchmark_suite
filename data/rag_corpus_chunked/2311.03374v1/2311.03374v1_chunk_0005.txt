or Not Useful) that characterises whether the comment helps developers comprehend the associated code Therefore in this classification task, the output is based on whether the information contained in the comment is relevant and would help to comprehend the surrounding code, i.e., it isuseful. Useful: Comments have sufficient software development concept → Comment is Relevant, and these concepts are not mostly present in the surrounding code→ Comment is not Redundant, hence the comment is Useful Not Useful: Comments have sufficient software development concept → Comment is Rele- vant, and these concepts are mostly present in the surrounding code → Comment is Redundant, hence the comment is Not Useful It may also be the case that comments do not contain sufficient software development concepts → Comment is Not Relevant, hence the comment is Not Useful. It is left to the participants to decide on the threshold value for how many concepts retrieved make a comment relevant or how many matches with surrounding code make a comment redundant. The notion of relevant comments refers to those that developers perceive as important in comprehending the associated or surrounding lines of code. These concepts are related to the outline of the algorithm, data-structure descriptions, mapping to user interface details, possible exceptions, version details, etc. In the below examples, the comments highlight useful details about the input data to the function, which is not evident from the associated code itself. Dataset: For the IRSE track, we use a set of 9048 comments (from Github) with comment text, surrounding code snippets, and a label that specifies whether the comment is useful or not. Sample data has been characterised in Table 1. • The development dataset contains 8048 rows of comment text, surrounding code snippets, and labels (Useful and Not useful). • The test dataset contains 1,000
