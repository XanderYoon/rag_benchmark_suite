no significant difference between the correlation of eRAG with IPA and FiD LLMs, eRAG consistently exhibits a higher correlation with the FiD. This observation can be elucidated by considering the distinction between IPA and FiD methodologies. In IPA, all documents are concatenated together and then presented as a single input to the LLM. In contrast, FiD processes each docu- ment individually by feeding them separately to the LLM’s encoder. Given that our approach aligns more closely with FiD, we believe this alignment is a contributing factor to the higher correlation between eRAG and the downstream performance of FiD. How much more efficient is eRAG compared to the end-to- end evaluation? Here, we consider two factors: inference time and memory consumption. For inference time, we compare the total time required for end-to-end evaluation to generate scores with the total time used by eRAG. In this experiment, we opt for the batch size of each approach to be as large as possible, maximizing the Table 2: The runtime and memory consumption of eRAG in comparison with end-to-end evaluation.

The results of this experiment are reported in Table 2. The findings indicate that, on average, eRAG is 2.468 times faster than end-to-end evaluation. Further elaborating, the speedup for eRAG ranges from 1.232 to 3.252 times compared to end-to-end evaluation across the datasets, where the least
