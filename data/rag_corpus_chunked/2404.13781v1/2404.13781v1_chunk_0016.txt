across differ- ent dataset. In summary, these experiments suggest that eRAG is more efficient than end-to-end evaluation of a vanilla transformer, excelling in both inference time and memory utilization. 4 CONCLUSION This paper explores various approaches for evaluating retrieval models within a RAG pipeline. Additionally, it introduces eRAG, a novel approach for evaluating retrieval models in the RAG pipeline. eRAG leverages the per-document performance of the LLM on the downstream task to generate relevance labels. The findings suggest that the proposed approach exhibits significantly higher correlation with the downstream performance of the LLM. Furthermore, eRAG demonstrates greater efficiency than end-to-end evaluation in terms of both memory consumption and inference time.
