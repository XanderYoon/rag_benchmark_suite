Routing (Sugiura and Etzioni, 2000; Wang et al., 2024; Mu et al., 2024) seeks to direct queries to the most suitable search engines to opti- mize performance and reduce costs. Current query routing methods (Shnitzer et al., 2023; Mu et al., 2024) primarily use open-sourced (query, answer) paired data to create training labels. Specifically, by leveraging these gold-standard *Work done during internship at Alibaba Inc. †Corresponding author.

We merge all test sets and calculate average end2end QA scores, i.e., Correctness, on the merged examples. No- RAG denotes that LLMs respond to the query without retrieval. Scores with bold denote the best results. answers, they assess the quality of retrieval- augmented responses for queries routed through different search engines, thereby identifying the most effective engine for each query. However, the reliance on annotated paired data presents chal- lenges such as limited diversity and high annota- tion costs, which significantly restrict scalability. Moreover, there exists a pronounced discrepancy between the distribution of public datasets and real user queries, which severely impacts the out-of- distribution generalization (Shnitzer et al., 2023) of these methods, limiting their effectiveness in real- world applications. To enable models to generalize effectively to actual user queries, it is essential to train them directly on real user queries. Neverthe- less, real user queries often lack gold-standard an- swers, presenting a major challenge in determining the appropriate search engine assignment, particu- larly when no definitive answer is available. To address this challenge, we must transform our problem into a labelling-free form. Since query
