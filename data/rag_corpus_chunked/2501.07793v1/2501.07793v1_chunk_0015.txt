queries, ultimately, it is promising to obtain more refined and satisfied outcomes in diverse applications. • The effectiveness of our method is observed consistently across various LLMs and multiple datasets, underscoring the robustness and stabil- ity of our approach. The key reason is that a wide variety of real user queries are directly uti- lized for the learning of query routing, which can effectively guarantee data diversity. • On NLPCC-MH and CDQA datasets, our method outperforms the benchmarking baseline, demon- strating that it has learned the routing mechanism to some extent. This capability enables it to as- sign queries to the most suitable search engine, resulting in superior performance. While our method does not outperform the best baseline on some datasets, we attribute this limitation to the still insufficient volume of training data. Actu- ally, query routing among general-purpose search engines is an extremely difficult task, since even humans struggle to determine which search en- gine should be selected to handle a query when they have no knowledge about black-box search engines. Fortunately, since we have observed the data scaling effect, we have reason to believe that if we continue to expand the data volume, our method will show even greater improvements and achieve optimal results. Overall, by systematically varying the size of the training dataset, we observe compelling scalability for our method, which demonstrates its potential for utilizing more data for training. 5.3 The Evaluation of Generalization Ability Our model theoretically has good generalization ability. The underlying principle is that by collect- ing sufficient real user queries, data diversity can be ensured, enabling the model to effectively gener- alize to unseen data. Consequently, in this section, we compare our approach with existing supervised methods to assess its generalization ability. Setting Our method uses real user queries for training. As
