B Experimental Setting Details Construction Details about PrivateQA Pri- vateQA primarily consists of questions related to timeliness. The question-answer examples are col- lected from public QA websites or translated from public English datasets using GPT4. We prioritize privacy protection and data integrity, ensuring that the dataset contains only open-domain QA con- tent and excludes any private, harmful, or unethical material.
