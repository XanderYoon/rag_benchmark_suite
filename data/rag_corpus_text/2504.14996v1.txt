Distributed Cognition for AI-supported Remote Operations: Challenges and Research Directions. 1, 1 (April 2025), 7 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/nnnnnnn.nnnnnnn 1 Introduction The introduction of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) into remote operations will have a tremendous eﬀect on operators’ cogn i- tion [31, 37]. Remote operation refers to the process of moni toring, controlling, or supervising systems, machinery, o r environments from a distance using remote user interfaces [ 7, 28], sensors, and networked communication technolo- gies [25]. These operations depend on real-time informatio n visualisation to support operators in complex decision- making scenarios. Remote operations are widely used in doma ins where direct physical presence is impractical, costly, or hazardous [1]. Examples include air traﬃc control [9], in dustrial automation [3], and critical infrastructure man- agement. While AI-driven solutions can introduce eﬃciency gains in these domains, there may also be unintended consequences. Here, an increased reliance on AI could have p rofound implications for the operators’ cognitive func- tions, for example how the operators distribute cognition f or themselves [10, 12] and how it aﬀects team cognition for operators [20]. This paper was presented at the 2025 ACM Workshop on Human-AIInteraction for Augmented Reasoning (AIREASONING-2025-01). This is the authors’ version for arXiv. Authors’ Contact Information: Rune M.

Manuscript submitted to ACM Manuscript submitted to ACM 1 2 Jacobsen et al. Contemporary remote work and teleoperation scenarios ofte n exhibit distributed cognition, where cognitive pro- cesses are shared across human operators and tools in the env ironment [10], and now also AI systems. At the same time, team cognition, described as shared knowledge, menta l models and information processing for team coordina- tion, emerges as a critical factor. Put diﬀerently, a team’s collective cognitive state is not just the sum of individual s, but a product of communication and coordination that yields a shared understanding of tasks and situations [2, 32]. However, introducing AI into these teams in remote operatio ns also creates challenges. Prior work has, for exam- ple,identiﬁed risks of cognitive overload, as humans must m anage complex AI-driven information and alerts, and loss of situational awareness when automation handles tasks out -of-sight [23]. In turn, team dynamics can suﬀer when AI agents act without (eﬀectively) communicating their int entions, human teammates may consequently struggle to maintain common ground, leading to worsened coordination [ 18]. These challenges call for reimagining cognitive support systems with solutions that not only integrate AI in to augmented workﬂows but also actively protect human situational awareness and team cohesion, transforming rem ote operations into environments where technology and human expertise work in unison. In this paper, we highlight the impact of AI integration in re mote operations and the challenges it presents to distributed cognition among operators and team cognition i n human-AI collaboration. Grounded in the theories of distributed and team cognition, we identify three key areas of concern that arise in AI-supported remote operations: (1) reconﬁguring team cognition in human-AI teams, (2) adaptin g AI memory to align with human distributed cognition, and (3) leveraging AI as a fallback operator during communic ation disruptions. For each area of concern we describe pertinent challenges that emerges. To illustrate these cha llenges in a real-world setting, we focus on intelligent por ts, demonstrating how AI-driven decision-making may aﬀect coo rdination, memory structures, and resilience in remote environments. Based on these insights, we propose concrete research directions aimed at supporting and safeguarding human reasoning in AI-augmented workﬂows, ensuring that AI enhances, rather than disrupts, cognitive processes in remote operations. 2 Related Work Distributed cognition is a theoretical framework that exte nds the traditional view of cognition beyond an individual’ s mind to include interactions between people, artifacts, an d their environment. Hutchins [12, 13] introduced this con- cept through studies of ship navigation and cockpit operati ons, arguing that cognition is distributed across multiple memory and processing units, including both human and non-h uman components. In these settings, knowledge is not stored solely within individuals but is externalised in artifacts such as maps, logbooks, and instruments, which enable coordination and decision-making [24]. This perspe ctive shifts the focus from isolated cognitive processes to a broader system of interdependent elements working togethe r to accomplish goals, such as steering a ship or ﬂying an aircraft [13]. DC highlights three core aspects of distribu ted information processing: how knowledge is represented and shared, how communication occurs as an activity unfolds , and how coordination is achieved across distributed units [22]. For example, in Hutchins’ [12] analysis of ship n avigation, he describes how one worker records positional information in a logbook, which is then interpreted by a team member who recalibrates the navigational tools ac- cordingly. The coordination of these individual contribut ions allows the system as a whole to function eﬀectively. By framing cognition as a socio-technical process embedded in dynamic interactions, DC provides a lens to analyse how individuals, teams, and artifacts collectively solve comp lex problems. In collaborative environments, a term often used is team cog nition [21], which examines how groups of individ- uals collaboratively manage and process information to ach ieve shared objectives [20]. Teams operating in dynamic, Manuscript submitted to ACM Distributed Cognition for AI-supported Remote Operations : Challenges and Research Directions 3 high-stakes settings, such as emergency response, aviatio n, or remote operations, rely on eﬀective information ﬂow, coordination, and shared mental models to function eﬃcient ly [6, 20]. A key concept in team cognition is implicit coordination, where team members anticipate each other’s n eeds and actions without the need for explicit communi- cation [20, 26]. This anticipation reduces communication o verhead, allowing team members to focus on task execu- tion rather than constantly negotiating roles and responsi bilities [20]. Implicit coordination is particularly bene ﬁcial in time-sensitive environments, where excessive communic ation can increase cognitive load and slow down decision- making [20]. Shared mental models play a crucial role in this process by enabling team members to develop a mutual understanding of both their own tasks, roles, and expected b ehaviours [6], as well as the tasks of others in a team. These models help individuals predict the actions of their t eammates and adjust their behaviour accordingly, enhanc- ing synchronisation and reducing misunderstandings [5]. S ituational awareness further supports team cognition by ensuring that members remain informed about the evolving co ntext of their work, allowing them to react appropri- ately to unexpected changes [5, 6]. In distributed teams, particularly in remote or virtual operations, maintaining these cognitive mechanisms becomes more challenging due to the re liance on mediated communication and asynchronous collaboration. Nevertheless, applying a distributed cogn ition perspective to team-based work allows us to consider how cognitive processes extend beyond individual actors to encompass collective, technology-mediated workﬂows. 3 Areas of Concern in AI-supported Remote Operations AI is rapidly taking on a growing role as decision-making or d ecision-support tool, shaping workﬂows, adapting to change, and operating with decreasing human intervention i n remote operations. This shift challenges traditional models of team cognition, raising critical questions about how operators can interact with AI in remote operations. For both distributed cognition and team cognition, AI (with varying levels of autonomy) will aﬀect how individuals and teams make decisions, how memory distributed across mul tiple entities may inﬂuence operations, as well as how decisions made during fallouts of communication can aﬀect t he distributed cognition. Using intelligent ports as a case study, the following sections explore key HCI challenges an d research directions for designing AI that integrates into both individual and team-based decision making. 3.1 Reconfiguring Human-AI Team Cognition Remote operations rely on distributed cognition, where hum an teams coordinate across distances using digital com- munication tools [34, 35], automated systems [36], and AI-s upported decision making [17]. Traditionally, AI has been treated as a tool that aids human decision-making, optimisi ng processes under human supervision. However, as re- mote operations become increasingly complex, AI is beginni ng to act as a more autonomous agent, making decisions in environments where immediate human oversight is not alwa ys feasible. This challenges traditional models of team cognition, which assume that humans are the primary agents responsible for coordination and decision making. When AI systems operate independently in remote environments, n ew interactional challenges emerge. Intelligent ports exemplify these challenges, as they rely on AI-driven scheduling and planning systems to manage vessel traﬃc, cargo logistics, and predictive maintenance [27]. Unlike traditional ports, where human operators directly oversee operations, intelligent ports function with a mix o f human supervision and semi-autonomous AI decision- making [3]. When congestion occurs ( e.g., multiple vessels arriving simultaneously due to weather- related delays) various subsystems must collaboratively adjust docking sc hedules, reroute ships, and allocate resources. However, if these agents operate as isolated decision-makers withou t a shared interaction framework, human operators may struggle to maintain awareness of AI-driven decisions or to intervene eﬀectively when adjustments are needed [15]. Manuscript submitted to ACM 4 Jacobsen et al. Without clear communication mechanisms between AI and huma n supervisors, operators may be forced to override AI decisions based on incomplete understanding. To address this, HCI research must rethink how human-AI teams establish and maintain cognitive alignment. First, research should explore how AI can develop a communic ative presence, not just through status updates, but through proactive engagement, feedback requests, and real -time collaborative problem-solving. This could involve A I using conversational interfaces, ambient notiﬁcations, o r even spatialised audio cues (as envisioned in homes [14]) t o provide reasoning in an unobtrusive yet eﬀective way. Second, current AI explainability research often focuses on post-hoc justiﬁcations, where AI explains why it made a decision after the fact. However, in remote operations, hum an operators should not only interpret AI’s past decisions but also be aware and potentially negotiate its future ones. We envision that instead of AI simply assigning a docking schedule in an intelligent port, it could engage in a lightwe ight, constraint-based negotiation with human operators— adapting its plan based on the operators’ expertise and real -time situational awareness. 3.2 Adapting AI Memory Remote operations generate vast amounts of data, requiring teams to ﬁlter, prioritise, and adapt information to chang- ing circumstances [4, 33] ( e.g., adaptive forgetting). Unlike humans, who naturally forge t irrelevant details and adjust their focus based on context, AI systems typically retain da ta, potentially treating pieces of information as impor- tant [16] ( e.g., catastrophic remembering). While comprehensive memory m ay seem advantageous, it can lead to cognitive overload for human operators, outdated decision -making, and ineﬃciencies when AI retrieves or acts on obsolete information. In dynamic environments where remot e operators must respond quickly to evolving conditions, AI’s inability to “forget” can become a liability rather tha n a strength. The challenge, therefore, is not just about mem - ory storage but about how AI dynamically adapts what it remem bers, forgets, and prioritises to maintain eﬀective collaboration in remote teams. Intelligent ports exemplify this issue, as they rely on AI-d riven monitoring and coordination to optimise logistics, equipment usage, and vessel movements. Over time, these AI s ystems accumulate extensive records of ship docking schedules, crane assignments, and cargo movements [29]. Wh ile historical data is valuable for trend analysis and predictive maintenance, this kind of rigid memory retention can also create ineﬃciencies in real-time decision-makin g. For instance, if an intelligent port’s AI continues priorit ising a crane based on its past reliability without factorin g in recent wear-and-tear or maintenance logs, it may misalloca te resources, leading to delays and ineﬃciencies. Without a mechanism for adaptive forgetting [16, 33], AI systems ris k overwhelming remote human operators with excessive alerts, unwarranted recommendations, or constraints that no longer reﬂect the current reality in the remote operations. To address this, HCI research must approach AI memory as inte ractive, adaptive, and explainable. First, it can be diﬃcult for human operators to understand why AI retrieves certain information or how past decisions shape future recommendations. Future collaborative tools could provide interactive interfaces for the AI’s memory, where users can view, query, edit, or even challenge AI’s rec all [30]. Second, unlike humans, who naturally ﬁlter and forget infor mation based on relevance, AI needs explicit mecha- nisms to prioritise what should be retained versus discarde d. HCI research should investigate adaptive mechanisms, where AI dynamically de-prioritise, delays, or removes information based on operational context and human feedback. For instance, could remote operators receive “forgetting suggestions” from the AI, prompting them to decide whether certain past rules or patterns should still inﬂuence future actions? Manuscript submitted to ACM Distributed Cognition for AI-supported Remote Operations : Challenges and Research Directions 5 Third, memory is not just an AI challenge, it is a shared cogni tive resource. Research should explore human-AI collaborative memory spaces, where both human operators an d AI can jointly build, reﬁne, and adapt a shared oper- ational history. For instance, in intelligent ports, AI cou ld maintain a dynamic knowledge graph of past disruptions, interventions, and operator adjustments, allowing humans to annotate, revise, or tag information for future AI refer- ence. 3.3 AI as a Fallback Operator Remote operations are highly dependent on stable digital in frastructure to maintain coordination between human teams and AI-driven systems [19]. However, network failures, cyberattacks, extreme weather conditions, or unforeseen technical malfunctions can disrupt real-time communicati on, leaving remote operators unable to intervene in critica l situations [8, 11]. Many AI systems have an assistive nature , meaning they either halt operations, wait for human re- engagement, or rigidly follow pre-programmed protocols wh en a disruption occurs. This creates a major operational risk as when communication is lost—who or what ensures conti nuity? In high-stakes remote environments, a lack of adaptable AI agency can lead to cascading failures, as AI remains passive in moments when rapid, autonomous decision- making is required. How to design AI that can temporarily ass ume responsibility, ensuring operational continuity during communication disruptions while facilitating a smo oth transition back to human control once connectivity is restored is therefore a timely challenge. Intelligent ports highlight this challenge, as they rely onAI-driven logistics systems to manage vessel docking, cargo handling, and supply chain synchronisation. These ports de pend on a complex web of interconnected intelligent sys- tems and remote human oversight, making them vulnerable to f ailures in networked coordination. Imagine a scenario where multiple container ships are en route to an intelligen t port when a connectivity failure isolates the port’s AI from remote human supervisors. If AI lacks fallback autonom y, it may either pause vessel docking, causing congestion and fuel waste, or rigidly follow pre-set schedules without accounting for new variables, such as worsening weather or an emergency requiring priority docking. Conversely, an AI system capable of temporarily assuming control could reconﬁgure docking priorities, reroute vessels, or coordi nate local autonomous systems while signalling uncertaint y levels and awaiting human re-engagement. First, the shift between human-led and AI-led operations sh ould not be considered as a binary switch but a gradual, interactive transition. Research should explore not only h ow AI may signal autonomy escalation ( e.g., when it detects a disruption and takes over), but also how it prepares humans for re-engagement when connectivity is restored. Second, if AI must make decisions in the absence of human inpu t, it must also communicate how certain or un- certain it is about those decisions after reconnecting. Res earch could explore how AI expresses its own conﬁdence levels, ﬂagging moments when its fallback autonomy is opera ting with incomplete or ambiguous data. For example, in an intelligent port AI might autonomously reroute a vesse l but signal uncertainty due to missing weather reports, prompting a human operator to validate the decision once rec onnected. Third, continuing in a similar vein, once human operators re gain control, understanding what the system did in the user’s absence is critical in restoring situational awa reness. Research should investigate how AI can generate interpretable, interactive autonomy logs, where operator s can review, adjust, or override AI-driven decisions. 4 Conclusion In conclusion, integrating artiﬁcial intelligence into re mote operations is not merely a technological upgrade, it is a fundamental shift that redeﬁnes how cognitive processes ar e distributed among human operators, AI systems, and Manuscript submitted to ACM 6 Jacobsen et al. collaborative teams. Our discussion has highlighted three critical areas of concern: the need to reconﬁgure human- AI team cognition, the challenges of adapting AI memory to dy namic operational contexts, and the importance of designing AI to function as a reliable fallback operator dur ing communication disruptions. Using intelligent ports as a case study, we illustrated how these challenges manifes t in real-world settings, where the potential beneﬁts of AI-driven decision-making must be balanced against risks t o situational awareness and team coordination. Moving forward, research must focus on creating systems and interfaces that foster transparent, adaptive, and resilient human- AI collaboration. By doing so, we can harness the eﬃciency an d decision-making powers of AI while safeguarding the cognitive strengths and coordination of human teams. Ultim ately, the goal is to ensure that as AI becomes an ever- more integral part of remote operations, it enhances rather than undermines the distributed and collective intelligence that lies at the heart of eﬀective, safe, and complex operati onal practices.
