The Next Phase of Scientific Fact-Checking: Advanced Evidence Retrieval from Complex Structured Academic Papers Xingyu Deng xdeng37@sheffield.ac.uk University of Sheffield Sheffield, UK Xi Wang xi.wang@sheffield.ac.uk University of Sheffield Sheffield, UK Mark Stevenson mark.stevenson@sheffield.ac.uk University of Sheffield Sheffield, UK Abstract Scientific fact-checking aims to determine the veracity of scien- tific claims by retrieving and analysing evidence from research literature. The problem is inherently more complex than general fact-checking since it must accommodate the evolving nature of scientific knowledge, the structural complexity of academic litera- ture and the challenges posed by long-form, multimodal scientific expression. However, existing approaches focus on simplified ver- sions of the problem based on small-scale datasets consisting of abstracts rather than full papers, thereby avoiding the distinct chal- lenges associated with processing complete documents. This paper examines the limitations of current scientific fact-checking systems and reveals the many potential features and resources that could be exploited to advance their performance. It identifies key research challenges within evidence retrieval, including (1) evidence-driven retrieval that addresses semantic limitations and topic imbalance (2) time-aware evidence retrieval with citation tracking to mit- igate outdated information, (3) structured document parsing to leverage long-range context, (4) handling complex scientific expres- sions, including tables, figures, and domain-specific terminology and (5) assessing the credibility of scientific literature. Preliminary experiments were conducted to substantiate these challenges and identify potential solutions. This perspective paper aims to advance scientific fact-checking with a specialised IR system tailored for real-world applications.

Scientific fact-checking is a spe- cialised variant of this task, grounded in scientific knowledge, with the objective of combating misinformation that affects the pub- lic, helping researchers in knowledge discovery and assisting in- dividuals in understanding scientific advancements [ 97]. This is particularly important given the rapid emergence of new scien- tific findings, where both professionals and the public must assess the credibility of information. A prominent case occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, in which politically motivated misinfor- mation—ranging from inflated infection statistics to unsupported treatments—circulated extensively, eroding public trust and endan- gering health communication [58]. However, existing approaches to scientific fact-checking remain limited, primarily relying on the retrieval of evidence from relatively simple and small-scale sources [16, 49, 62, 72, 75, 100, 101, 104]. For example, SciFact-Open [101], the largest available dataset for scientific fact-checking, contains 500,000 documents – substantially smaller than PubMed, which con- tains over 37 million biomedical publications. In addition, SciFact- Open consists only of abstracts, rather than full-text papers, thereby excluding critical structural and citation information, ignoring long- range context and scientific expression conveyed through tables and figures. These design simplifications may hinder the applicabil- ity of current approaches in real-world settings, where scientific evidence is embedded in long and structurally complex documents with multimodal content. Fact-checking is a knowledge-intensive task, where the verifica- tion process relies on sourcing evidence from a reliable upstream Information Retrieval (IR) system. Emerging findings indicate the value of effective retrieval in improving fact-checking systems. For example, introducing even a small amount of noise into evi- dence can significantly degrade fact-checking performance [ 76]. Recent Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) techniques have been widely used for fact-checking [28, 47, 63, 70, 80, 84, 94], where retrieval models are fine-tuned to identify high-quality evidence for claim verification. These observations underscore the critical role of robust evidence retrieval, as an ideal IR system for fact- checking should rank all relevant evidence at the top while filtering out non-evidential noise. Ensuring retrieval robustness is crucial to maintaining sufficient yet relevant evidence, which is essential for improving scientific fact-checking accuracy. A major trend in fact-checking research is to consider realistic set- tings that employ rich, diverse and timely evidence sources, as seen in FEVER (using Wikipedia) [90] and AVeriTeC (using web-wide resources) [78]. In document level evidence retrieval, current arXiv:2506.20844v2 [cs.IR] 29 Jun 2025 ICTIR ’25, July 18, 2025, Padua, Italy Xingyu Deng, Xi Wang, Mark Stevenson general fact-checking systems over-rely on commercial search APIs, which do not consider the specific requirements of fact-checking [77, 91, 116]. Such reliance on commercial search APIs – with lim- ited adaptability – has left document retrieval methodologies under- explored in fact-checking, especially for domain-specific corpora such as scientific fact-checking. Current scientific fact-checking sys- tems primarily employ off-the-shelf IR methods [97], such as lexical matching and semantic relevance ranking, which do not scale effec- tively for large-scale scientific corpora. In addition, the distribution of relevant evidence across scientific topics is highly imbalanced, which degrades both retrieval effectiveness and efficiency, espe- cially for claims with scarce supporting literature. SciFact-Open [101], which extends the original SciFact dataset [ 100] for large- scale evaluation, illustrates this issue: verification performance on SciFact-Open drops by at least 15 F1 points for all well-performed fact-checking systems developed in SciFact [101]. While increasing corpus size enhances evidence diversity, it also amplifies retrieval noise, reducing efficiency in both retrieval and verification. Beyond that, high semantic relevance does not guarantee high evidential relevance, and irrelevant yet semantically similar documents can introduce noise into downstream verification [ 117]. These chal- lenges underscore the necessity of developing tailored document retrieval systems specifically designed for scientific fact-checking, as effective retrieval is a prerequisite for accurate claim verification. Beyond document-level evidence retrieval, within-document evidence retrieval is also essential for processing complex sci- entific literature. Scientific papers, unlike general fact-checking documents, are long, structured, domain-specific and involve addi- tional metadata. As scientific fact-checking evolves from abstract- based to full-paper retrieval, retrieval models must account for metadata (e.g., publish date, citations) and complex structured data format (e.g., charts, tables, figures). This necessitates the adaptation of verification models such as SciBERT [ 11] for domain-specific terminologies [100], Longformer [ 12] for long-range dependen- cies [102] and TAPAS [ 38] for tabular data verification [ 3]. Sci- entific expressions in academic papers are highly structured and contextually interdependent, where textual content, tabular data, and figures mutually reinforce the conveyed information. How- ever, existing scientific fact-checking systems primarily operate at the abstract level, adopting methodologies similar to general fact-checking [49, 50, 68, 72, 75, 97, 100, 102, 111, 119], albeit incor- porating domain-specific models such as BioSentVec [21] and SciB- ERT [11]. The development of public full-paper datasets aligns with the requirement of real-world scientific fact-checking systems for effective verification. This highlights the urgent need for retrieval and verification methodologies that can leverage entire scientific documents. Accordingly, within-document evidence retrieval and its integration into verification pipelines should be explored to fully unlock the potential of scientific literature for fact-checking. This perspective paper presents a comprehensive examination of the challenges associated with evidence retrieval in scientific fact- checking, highlighting challenges that are not typically faced within general fact-checking, leading to the need for specialised retrieval and verification strategies. We advocate for proactive re- search efforts to develop scalable methodologies while addressing the limitations of current datasets. We structure our discussion into two parts following a typical fact-checking pipeline: Sections 2–3 explore document-level evidence retrieval while Sections 4–8 ex- plore within-document evidence retrieval in scientific publication for scientific fact-checking. Each of the following sections identi- fies a research challenge followed by a tentative and illustrative research direction (RD). 2 Beyond Semantics Evidence retrieval for fact checking is closely related to traditional document retrieval techniques, which typically focus on retrieving documents that are semantically similar to a query or contain match- ing keywords. While this approach is effective in many scenarios, it often fails to address the ultimate objective of fact-checking – successful claim verification. Evidence retrieval that relies solely on semantic similarity may prioritise irrelevant or low-context infor- mation, introducing noise into the subsequent verification process. Recent IR studies [67, 92] show that semantic relevance alone may not ensure utility in knowledge-intensive NLP tasks under the RAG framework, suggesting the importance of utility-aware retrieval strategies. To improve the verification utility of evidence retrieval systems, techniques such as fine-tuning, joint optimisation, and learning from verification feedback have been developed. These approaches leverage relevance labels derived from annotated gold evidence [40, 68, 117, 119, 120]. Although graded relevance has been extensively explored in general IR, current evidence retrieval systems for fact-checking often oversimplify relevance as binary, failing to differentiate between fully non-evidential and partially relevant evidence. This coarse-grained labelling scheme fails to differentiate between completely non-evidential documents and partially relevant (plausible) evidence. Negative examples and ran- domly retrieved examples are equally treated as 0, despite exhibiting varying degrees of evidential support. We argue that evidence re- trieval should distinguish between non-evidential information and plausible evidence, enhancing the model’s ability to identify previ- ously unobserved but potentially useful evidence within large-scale corpora. Developing an IR system that can effectively differentiate be- tween evidential and non-evidential information requires access to fine-grained relevance labels during training. However, manu- ally constructing negative samples is both complex and resource- intensive due to the vast number of unlabelled documents and sentences that lack explicit pairing with given claims. Furthermore, assessing the degree of evidential support for a claim within unla- belled documents is inherently challenging. To validate the impact of fine-grained evidential relevance, beyond semantic relevance, we carry out preliminary experiments which explore the use of down- stream verification feedback to capture different levels of evidential values. Experiment Overview. The experiment investigates whether combining verification feedback with semantic relevance improves the performance of document evidence retrieval. Figure 1 presents the pipeline, where probabilities from downstream verification serve as feedback. Specifically, we integrate two components: 1) the semantic relevance score, computed using an off-the-shelf reranker model, and (2) the verification success feedback score, derived from a fine-tuned verifier model, indicating the degree to which a docu- ment is evidential for a given claim.

It also demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in evidence retrieval for verification [68, 97, 102]. The model assigns a predicted score, 𝑠𝑟 𝑐,𝑑, representing the semantic relevance for a document 𝑑 to a claim 𝑐 as defined in Equation 1. 𝑓 (𝑐, 𝑑) → 𝑠𝑟 𝑐,𝑑, 𝑠 𝑟 𝑐,𝑑 ∈ ( 0, 1) (1) MultiVerS is the best-performing verifier model on SciFact [ 97, 102]. We reproduced this model using the official implementation1 while adjusting the negative sampling parameter from 20 to 5 to avoid over-fitted verification feedback. The model predicts the veri- fication outcome as per the calculated probabilities for a document 𝑑 either supporting 𝑝𝑟 𝑐,𝑑, refuting 𝑝𝑠 𝑐,𝑑 or providing insufficient in- formation 𝑝𝑛 𝑐,𝑑, relative to a claim 𝑐, as follows: 𝑉 (𝑐, 𝑑) = 𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑎𝑥 (𝑝𝑟 𝑐,𝑑, 𝑝𝑛 𝑐,𝑑, 𝑝𝑠 𝑐,𝑑 ) (2) +Verification (Ideal Reranker Model) combines semantic relevance and verification feedback to refine evidential retrieval. The final retrieval score is calculated by summing the semantic score (𝑠𝑟 𝑐,𝑑) and the verification probabilities (𝑝𝑟 𝑐,𝑑 and 𝑝𝑛 𝑐,𝑑), followed by a nor- malisation step to ensure the score remains within (0,1), formulated as: 𝑠𝑟 +𝑣 𝑐,𝑑 = 1/2 ∗ (𝑠𝑟 𝑐,𝑑 + 𝑝𝑟 𝑐,𝑑 + 𝑝𝑠 𝑐,𝑑 ) ∈ ( 0, 1) (3) This formulation ensures that documents contributing to support or refute labels receive higher retrieval scores, enhancing the evi- dential quality of retrieved documents. To evaluate retrieval effectiveness, we use Recall@k (R@k), a common evaluation approach that measures the proportion of rele- vant evidence successfully retrieved within the top 𝑘 results. 1https://github.com/dwadden/multivers Table 1: Retrieval result on SciFact-Open and Check-COVID SciFact-Open R@50 R@20 R@10 R@5 R@3 R@1 BM25 66.09 54.78 45.22 38.04 30.87 20.22 monoT5-3B 88.91 79.13 71.09 57.17 48.26 31.09 +Verification 91.96 81.95 71.30 62.61 52.83 32.17 Check-COVID R@50 R@20 R@10 R@5 R@3 R@1 BM25 87.91 81.96 75.02 67.59 61.35 46.18 monoT5-3B 95.84 93.16 89.49 82.06 74.93 58.28 +Verification 96.13 94.55 91.48 84.04 77.80 61.84 Table 2: Evidence positions in the retrieved list.

We conduct our evaluation using datasets including: (1) SciFact [100]: A corpus of 5,183 abstracts from scientific arti- cles, with 809/300/300 samples for train, validation and test sets. The test set is not publicly accessible. (2) SciFact-Open [101]: An extended version of SciFact with 500K abstracts, re-annotating evi- dence documents for 279 claims from the original SciFact test set.(3) Check-COVID [104]: A COVID-19-specific fact-checking dataset, containing 347 abstracts from CORD-19 journal articles and 1,504 expert annotated news-related claims. MultiVerS is trained on the SciFact train set to create a verifier model that provides verification feedback. Since the SciFact test set is inaccessible, we evaluate document evidence retrieval on SciFact-Open and full Check-COVID. Results. The integration of verification feedback consistently en- hanced document evidence retrieval, as +Verification outperformed monoT5-3B across nearly all cut-off thresholds in both SciFact-Open and Check-COVID (Table 1). The improvements are particularly ev- ident at lower cut-offs, where retrieving the most relevant evidence is crucial. In SciFact-Open, Recall@5 and Recall@3 increased from 57.17% to 62.61% and from 48.26% to 52.83%, respectively. Similarly, in Check-COVID, these metrics improved from 82.06% to 84.04% and from 74.93% to 77.80%. These improvements are particularly meaningful given that the average number of gold evidence doc- uments per claim is 1 in Check-COVID and approximately 2 in SciFact-Open. To illustrate this improvement, we conducted a case study examining how different retrieval methods ranked specific evidence documents (Table 2). Compared to monoT5-3B, +Verifi- cation successfully elevated the ranks of E2, E3 and E5, retrieving three additional pieces of evidence within the top 5 results. Notably, E5, ranked 302nd by monoT5-3B, was effectively rescued by adding verification feedback in +Verification, demonstrating the value of integrating verification-informed retrieval signals. These findings highlight a promising research direction: shift- ing from semantic-only retrieval towards evidence-aware retrieval, where retrieval models explicitly account for evidential value. Our results suggest that leveraging well-performing verification models can help refine retrieval systems by distinguishing between purely ICTIR ’25, July 18, 2025, Padua, Italy Xingyu Deng, Xi Wang, Mark Stevenson semantic relevance and plausible evidential relevance among unan- notated documents. Furthermore, to continually improve evidence- aware retrieval, we propose the development of tailored IR systems capable of identifying evidential information, thereby enhancing evidence retrieval for scientific fact-checking. RD.1. Benchmark tailored IR system for fact-checking The preliminary study presented in this work outlined a framework to enhance evidence retrieval beyond only semantic relevance. To overcome the limitations of existing IR systems in scientific fact- checking scenarios, it is imperative to develop specialised IR sys- tems capable of handling the specific challenges of verification tasks. However, training an IR system on a single fact-checking dataset risks poor generalizability and potential overfitting, particularly due to data imbalance, a common issue in the relatively small datasets characteristic of scientific fact-checking [ 97, 116]. Furthermore, poor verification performance deteriorates retrieval accuracy, cre- ating a vicious feedback loop that further degrades overall system effectiveness. A multi-pronged strategy could mitigate these chal- lenges by pooling verification signals from various high-performing verifier models, leveraging large-scale datasets such as FEVER [90] to improve training robustness, and providing a shared retrieval checkpoint enable subsequent studies to fine-tune the model for specific scenarios or datasets while reducing training cost. Recent work [51, 74] has explored unified retrieval models for knowledge- intensive NLP tasks, focusing on retrieval quality and downstream task utility [73, 115], including question answering (QA) and fact- checking. Similarly, we propose a verification-driven IR system for evidence retrieval, which explicitly incorporates evidential infor- matics. This approach follows a two-step training paradigm: general pre-training on large, diverse datasets followed by domain-specific fine-tuning. This approach balances scalability and domain speci- ficity, ensuring IR models are both robust across different contexts and highly effective in targeted fact-checking applications. Addi- tionally, a corresponding benchmark should employ a diverse set of evaluation metrics beyond for the fact-checking task to ensure comprehensive assessment of performance within fact-checking [6]. These metrics could include verification accuracy, reflecting the downstream utility of retrieved evidence; decision latency, measur- ing the computational efficiency of retrieval models; and robustness to real-world conditions such as noisy data and incomplete evidence, to improve system resilience. Integrating verification feedback into evidence retrieval improves relevance assessment beyond binary labels, enhancing retrieval per- formance. Future research should focus on developing a benchmark IR system tailored for fact-checking, incorporating fine-grained relevance labels and verification-driven retrieval models. A scalable pre-training and fine-tuning approach has the potential to improve retrieval robustness and generalizability thereby producing more accurate and efficient fact-checking systems. 3 Imbalanced resources of scientific topics In existing general fact-checking datasets, such as FEVER which is based on Wikipedia, the distribution of gold evidence per claim is relatively even and sufficient. However, a significant imbalance of evidence is observed in scientific fact-checking. While the SciFact Table 3: Sufficient-evidence claim and none-evidence claim exam- ples in SciFact-Open. ‘Evidence’ is the number of evidence in SciFact- Open corpus and ‘Entities’ is the number of entities by searching bold-keyword in PubMed. Claim Evidence Entities Obesity is determined in part by genetic factors. 24 499k LRBA controls CTLA - 4 expression. 0 0.27k corpus (~5K documents) maintains a relatively balanced number of evidence documents per claim, this balance was disrupted when the dataset was expanded to create SciFact-Open (~500K documents). In this larger corpus, the majority of claims have none or only one piece of supporting evidence while others have over. Claims related to less-researched topics are generally associated with fewer scientific publications, as illustrated by the examples in Table 3. However, most fact-checking systems do not explicitly account for evidence imbalance. A common approach is to use a fixed re- trieval cut-off (i.e., selecting a predefined number of top-ranked documents for verification). One of the most inefficient approaches is setting the cut-off equal to the maximum number of evidence per claim in the dataset, ensuring that all possible evidence is re- trieved. This heuristic has not previously caused major issues since general fact-checking datasets contain a relatively balanced num- ber of supporting documents per claim. However, the imbalance in SciFact-Open suggests that the simple approach may not be suitable for open-domain scientific fact-checking with two major drawbacks: (1) Inefficiency.Although the maximum number of gold evi- dence documents in the SciFact-Open dataset is 24, less than one third of claims have more than two. Using the maximum number as a cut-off would be inefficient due to the large number of documents that would have to be processed by the verifier. (2) Inaccuracy.Introducing irrelevant evidence into downstream verification degrades fact-checking performance, whether the noise is semantically related or completely random [76] (as discussed in Section 2). To address these challenges in the current and future studies of scientific fact-checking, we proposed a research direction based on flexible cut-off strategy for retrieving evidence based on claim characteristics. RD.2. Flexible cut-off for Retrieved Evidence Ranked List Truncation (RLT) refers to the task of selecting an opti- mal prefix of a ranked list of retrieved documents, with the goal of balancing retrieval effectiveness and efficiency. Prior work explores both heuristic and learned approaches, using either relevance labels or features derived from score distributions to determine the cut-off point [10, 52, 59, 61, 103, 109]. A related line of work is stopping methods in technology-assisted review (TAR) [14, 15, 85], which aim to retrieve as much relevant information as possible while min- imising the effort spent on examining irrelevant documents. Both approaches aim to optimise an expected metric over candidate cut positions, typically using metrics such as 𝐹 1@𝑘 or 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 @𝑘. The datasets used in these prior studies on RLT and stopping methods, such as CLEF and TREC [25–27, 33, 43–45], exhibit imbalance but The Next Phase of Scientific Fact-Checking: Advanced Evidence Retrieval from Complex Structured Academic Papers ICTIR ’25, July 18, 2025, Padua, Italy typically contain enough relevant items per query to support recall- based supervision and evaluation. This dependence on sufficient relevance labels becomes problematic in fact-checking scenarios, where gold evidence documents are typically rare, making both recall-based stopping and supervised RLT approaches unsuited to this problem. To explore whether relevance score distributions indicate evi- dence sufficiency, we compare well-studied and less-studied claims from SciFact-Open. Following Wadden et. al. [ 101], claims with four or more gold evidence documents are considered to be well- studied and those with none to be less-studied. Using monoT5-3B, we compute several statistics over the ranked document scores, including first-document relevance, average and total scores, score decay, and the initial-to-final score ratio. Table 4 shows that well- studied claims tend to have higher top-ranked scores and sharper decay patterns, suggesting that relevance distributions may serve as indicators of evidence sufficiency.

A prediction module could utilise statistical features of relevance distribution such as those presented in Table 4. In addi- tion, metadata such as retrieved entity counts in PubMed (Table 3) can serve as auxiliary signals to refine the prediction. Claims pre- dicted as less-studied – e.g., with low total relevance or steep score decay – may be assigned smaller cut-offs to reduce verification cost, while RLT and stopping techniques could be applied to well-studied claims where concentrated high scores suggest richer evidence. While this naive strategy relies on heuristic features, it does not explicitly optimise verification performance. To address this, future approaches could explore learning a cut-off policy using feedback from the verification stage. Specifically, truncation points may be selected based on reward signals, such as whether the claim is cor- rectly verified or the confidence of the verifier. This would bypass the need for relevance-labelled supervision, which is often infeasi- ble in scientific fact-checking due to sparse annotations. Inspired by prior RLT and stopping method work, such a learned policy could optimise both efficiency and factual accuracy by aligning truncation decisions with downstream verification performance. 4 Time and Citation General fact-checking evidence corpus such as Wikipedia and fact- checking websites, often lack sentence-level evidence timestamps, making it difficult to determine the original publish time of sentence evidence in verification and hindering the development of time- aware retrieval methods. Timeliness is important in fact-checking, but in science, evolving evidence makes outdated studies particu- larly problematic. For instance, early COVID-19 treatment studies Table 5: Results of health QA task considering the different thresholds of the published time of literature [99] Year Precision Recall F1 score ≥2020 59.7 60.3 58.7 ≥2018 59.6 58.0 57.9 ≥2015 61.1 56.0 53.9 ≥2010 63.4 55.6 52.8 ≥2005 68.1 56.5 52.0 ≥2000 66.1 56.8 51.8 ≥1990 65.6 55.4 51.3 ≥1980 64.2 54.7 50.0 were later refuted, and outdated evidence may lead to harmful de- cisions. This section discusses whether scientific publications are more suitable for time-aware fact-checking and explores possible ways to leverage their inherent temporal characteristics. 4.1 Timeliness of evidence Unlike general fact-checking, where historical and static facts re- main unchanged, scientific knowledge continuously evolves. This fundamental difference necessitates time-aware retrieval in scien- tific fact-checking to ensure that retrieved evidence remain valid and reflective of the latest scientific consensus. A time-sensitive retrieval mechanism should prioritise recent publications to en- sure that fact-checking systems incorporate the most up-to-date methodologies and factual updates. This is especially crucial in fields like healthcare, where relying on outdated information could lead to misleading conclusions or incorrect decisions. For example, during a rapidly evolving pandemic, a medical treatment initially considered effective might later be deemed unreliable. This sec- tion discusses the challenges and opportunities of integrating the evidence timestamp into scientific fact-checking. Scientific fact-checking aims to find evidential information in the literature to verify a claim. Intuitively, considering outdated literature negatively affects verification. Research in healthcare question answering (QA) has demonstrated that time-aware re- trieval improves system performance [99], as shown in Table 5. The F1 score of the healthcare QA system improves as the publication year of evidence documents becomes more recent. By extension, scientific fact-checking on a large-scale corpus may also suffer from incorporating outdated evidence. These findings highlight the need for time-aware filtering in scientific fact-checking systems to en- hance reliability. Fact-checking datasets could explicitly incorporate timestamps as metadata to facilitate research into temporal rele- vance in retrieval and verification. A general fact-checking study [9] collected the ‘timestamp of last update’ of claims and evidential documents, allowing later research [ 8] to explore the impact of temporal data on verification. This study found that a time-aware system achieved a 15% improvement in macro F1 score, underscor- ing the importance of temporal information. However, this work was limited by: (1) focusing on verification only , where evidence documents had already been retrieved in a separate initial step, without ensuring that retrieval prioritised high-quality and tem- porally relevant evidence, and (2) the use of fragmented evidence – ICTIR ’25, July 18, 2025, Padua, Italy Xingyu Deng, Xi Wang, Mark Stevenson the general fact-checking datasets usually only contain small snip- pets of web documents, omitting many important time expressions present in full texts. Given these findings, it is essential to develop a fact-checking system that explicitly incorporates temporal awareness across both retrieval and verification stages to meet real-world applications. RD.3. Time-A ware Retrieval and Verification Traditional fact-checking approaches often handle conflicting evi- dence for a single claim by assigning neutral veracity labels, such as “mixture, " “unproven, " or “not enough information" [37, 97]. However, conflicting evidence often arises due to outdated stud- ies included in the retrieval process, which introduces noise and adversely affects prediction accuracy [99]. This issue has been ob- served in healthcare QA systems, where outdated evidence degrades performance [99]. To address this issue, we propose a time-aware approach that incorporates temporal information into both retrieval and verification stages: 1.Retrieval Stage: Outdated evidence should be filtered or de- prioritised during retrieval to ensure that the retrieved evidence set is temporally aligned with the latest scientific findings. 2.Verification Stage: After filtering by time-aware retrieval, all retrieved evidence should be considered but with differentiated weighting based on temporal relevance. Recent evidence should be prioritised through higher weights, while older evidence should serve as supplementary or contextual information rather than pri- mary evidence. By processing outdated evidence differently across retrieval and verification components, this direction explores how temporal in- formation can reduce noise and improve the reliability of scientific fact-checking systems. 4.2 Indirect evidence through citation General fact-checking faces a number of challenges when attempt- ing to determine the timeliness of evidence: (1) Lack of publication timestamp [8]. Many fact-checking sources, such as Wikipedia and fact-checking websites, do not provide precise publication dates for individual sentences or paragraphs. Instead, they record only the last edited timestamp, which does not accurately reflect when a fact was first published. (2) Tracking the origin of evidence. Evidence is often copied or paraphrased across multiple sources, making it difficult to determine the original publication date of a statement. (3) Search engine bias in retrieval . Pre-established fact-checking datasets retrieve evidence using top-k search engine results, where ranking mechanisms may prioritise recent documents due to time- aware ranking biases. This can misrepresent the actual chronology of claims and lead to fragmented evidence, making time extraction unreliable. While these challenges also affect scientific fact-checking, they can be naturally mitigated by leveraging full-text papers rather than abstract-only sources. The main advantages of using full-text papers include: (1) Explicit publication metadata: Each piece of literature has a clearly defined publication date, ensuring accurate temporal tracking. (2) Citation tracing for indirect evidence : Mandatory cita- tion rules in academic publications facilitate source tracing, even when statements are referenced indirectly. (3) Structured nature of academic papers : provides an indication of the origin of state- ments. For example, evidence in the background section typically references prior studies, whereas those in the abstract or results sections represent findings from the current publication. Given these inherent advantages, incorporating timestamps as metadata offers a promising research direction for full-paper-based scien- tific fact-checking. Exploring the temporal dynamics of claims and evidence should further enhance retrieval accuracy. Additionally, ci- tation tracking to trace the original source of paraphrased evidence, ensuring the first-published timestamp is accurately recorded. Citation-based tracking provides a promising approach to esti- mating evidence timestamps. However, the widespread presence of multiple citations in scientific literature makes it difficult to iden- tify which references should be tracked, increasing computational costs and reducing efficiency. Moreover, indirect citations and para- phrased references, particularly in introductory sections, further obscure the retrieval of the first-published source. To address these issues, we propose the following research direction to develop a more effective approach for citation tracking and timestamp attri- bution. RD.4. Citation-Based Evidence Tracking Intuitively, self-contained evidence refers to information directly presented in the body of the current paper, while cited evidence is derived from external sources referenced by the paper. To explore this distinction, we analysed 22 accessible full papers out of 24 gold evidence for the claim in Table 2. We prompted GPT-4o to search for supporting/refuting evidence and determine whether each piece of evidence was paraphrased/summarised from a citation or is self-contained. Figure 2: Evidence sources in scientific literature. The result shown in Figure 2 reveals, as expected, that cited evidence is predominantly located in the introduction, while self- contained evidence is more common in the results and conclusion sections. While we observed a few inaccurate outcomes (e.g., one ‘From Cited’ evidence appearing in ‘Abstract’ is misjudged), the overall distribution remains discernible and interpretable. In ad- dition, we also observed that sentences in scientific literature fre- quently contain multiple citations, making it costly to manually extract the original timestamp of cited evidence. To address this challenge, we propose a two-step approach: 1. Identify track-worthy citations.Not all citations are equally important for fact verification. Track-worthy citations should in- clude: conclusive evidence directly influences claim verification and The Next Phase of Scientific Fact-Checking: Advanced Evidence Retrieval from Complex Structured Academic Papers ICTIR ’25, July 18, 2025, Padua, Italy plausible evidence that may impact claim assessment [108]. Since checking every cited document is expensive, an initial filtering step is required. A potential solution is to rank citations based on their relevance and function. Citation recommendation [30, 34] is a similar task to identify relevant publications for a given statement using retrieval models. Beyond relevance, the function of citation can be referred to as a signal to adjust priority. Citations are classi- fied into eight categories: background, motivation, uses, extends, similarities, differences, compare/contrast, and future work [42]. While single evidence has multiple citations, the function of cita- tion can help identify the citations that align with the evidence. For example, for predicted evidence ‘Experiments show model A outperforms previous SOTA model B [citation 1,2,3]’, cited papers for ‘model A/B’ in the ‘introduction’ function are less check-worthy than the citation in the ‘compare/contrast’ function. By prioritising high-impact citations, retrieval costs can be significantly reduced. 2. Track the original timestamp of evidence. Once track- worthy citations are identified, the next step is to trace the original timestamp of cited evidence via direct and indirect citation tracking. Direct citation tracking can be applied if the publication date of the cited paper is straightforward to retrieve. However, some evidence is paraphrased or indirectly cited, requiring a deep tracking mech- anism to trace the citation path. Citation graph analysis [ 17, 96] can help map citation paths using directed graphs and applying search algorithms to identify the earliest relevant source. A recent study [118] found that reference errors – references do not include information to support statement – frequently appear ranging from 11% to 41% across domains. Addressing these errors introduces a sub-task for scientific fact-checking: verifying whether a cited reference truly supports the claim. To ensure feasibility, an early explorative study can assume that scientific literature generally adheres to citation conventions, preventing infinite citation loops in verification. In summary, to explore time-aware fact-checking for scientific literature, we propose two potential research directions: (1) Integrat- ing temporal information into retrieval and verification to handle outdated evidence and (2) Developing citation-based tracking meth- ods to identify the original source and timestamp of evidence. These directions provide a basis for studying the impact of time-aware mechanisms in scientific fact-checking systems. 5 Structured Long-Context Evidence Retrieval Existing scientific fact-checking datasets construct evidence cor- pora using fragmented sentences, paragraphs, or abstracts [16, 49, 62, 72, 75, 100, 104]. However, scientific literature is typically pre- sented in structured, visually rich formats, often as PDF documents, where different sections serve distinct functions: abstracts, results, and conclusions summarise key findings, while background and in- troduction sections provide prior research context. With the diverse and unique functionalities of scientific literature components, this section explores challenges and potential research directions for advancing scientific fact-checking at the full-paper level. Existing fact-checking pipelines typically follow a document retrieval and then sentence selection paradigm [ 37, 97, 116]. For general fact- checking, evidence retrieval often uses top-ranked sentences from top-ranked documents, treating them as self-contained evidence Title Authors Publish Venue Publish Time Citations: [ 25, 44 , 60 , 67, 78 , 82 , 92 Figure 3: An example for parsing the scientific literature units. However, this approach neglects long-range context, as using the extracted sentences ignores surrounding information to sup- port verification. In contrast, scientific documents exhibit higher document-level consistency of verdict, commonly one paper hav- ing a sole standpoint to a given question, making document-level processing necessary for scientific fact-checking [50, 102, 119]. LLMs have recently demonstrated growing capability to process long contexts. However, it remains challenging to fact-check an entire full-text document in a single pass [105]. LLMs are prone to hallucinating content that is not grounded in the provided docu- ments [2, 20, 23, 88] and are often susceptible to distraction from irrelevant context [82]. Their reasoning capabilities also degrade as text length increases [46]. A potential solution is context distil- lation, as used in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), to filter high-quality context and mitigate hallucination, which improves the performance of downstream QA tasks [106]. However, unlike the QA task, fact-checking requires explicit retrieval of explicit. Fil- tering context may remove crucial supporting evidence, leading to incomplete verification. Moreover, much of the historical scientific literature exists in PDF format. Although recent multimodal LLMs are capable of consuming PDFs and conducting reasoning tasks, their capabilities are still limited to surface-level understanding. For example, they frequently fail to capture cross-page content and complex layout structures [60, 87, 95]. By prompting GPT-4o to locate evidence in PDF literature with the results presented in Section 4.2, we observed that it mislocated evidence in incorrect sections or non-existent sections. These limitations indicate that ex- isting LLMs are not capable of supporting end-to-end fact-checking for long-context scientific literature – not only for raw PDFs but also for plain-text documents. In addition to their length, scientific papers follow a structured format that introduces additional challenges for verification. Back- ground and introduction sections often cite prior work, which may conflict with conclusions drawn later, while discussion sec- tions highlight limitations that can cast doubt on earlier findings. These internally inconsistent signals may introduce misleading information, demanding reasoning that accounts for both the fac- tual assertions and the functional roles of different sections. Pars- ing scientific documents into structured units enables a modular pipeline where retrieval and verification can be independently opti- mised. This modular structure facilitates interpretability, robustness, and denoising of conflicting or irrelevant content. Layout-aware tools offer a practical foundation for such structure-aware process- ing [19, 32, 41, 56, 81], as illustrated in Figure 3. ICTIR ’25, July 18, 2025, Padua, Italy Xingyu Deng, Xi Wang, Mark Stevenson To address these challenges, we advocate for a retrieval frame- work that explicitly considers the document structure commonly found within scientific literature. Such a system should identify targeted evidence, capture long-range context across sections, and suppress irrelevant or conflicting content. We next outline a direc- tion toward adaptive, section-aware retrieval strategies designed to meet these requirements. RD.5. Adaptive Section-A ware Evidence Retrieval Scientific literature follows a structured format where different sec- tions serve distinct functions, presenting challenges for traditional evidence retrieval and verification in fact-checking systems. Exist- ing retrieval methods often operate at the sentence or paragraph level, neglecting the long-range context and the structured nature of scientific documents. Additionally, large language models (LLMs) struggle to accurately associate claims with the appropriate sec- tions, leading to potential misinterpretations and inconsistencies. A promising research direction is adaptive section-aware ev- idence retrieval, which dynamically adjusts retrieval strategies based on document structure and claim types. This approach con- sists of two key components: Claim-evidence matching. Claims should first be matched to the most relevant sections. For instance, experiment-driven claims, such as “X method improves accuracy compared to Y, ” should pri- marily retrieve evidence from the ‘Results’ and ‘Conclusion’ sec- tions, as these contain empirical findings. In contrast, background or theoretical claims, such as “X method is widely used in Y applica- tions, ” should focus on the Introduction and Background sections, which provide foundational knowledge. Prioritising section-aware evidence retrieval helps filter irrelevant context and reduces re- trieval noise. Contextual expansion. After retrieving primary evidence, the system should augment it with relevant contextual information from other sections to improve interpretability. For example, method- ological details from the ‘Analysis’ section can provide additional support for experimental claims, while historical context from the Background section can clarify theoretical claims. Access to the full document allows for retrieving finer-grained evidence or comple- mentary details that fragmented approaches may overlook. In summary, an effective adaptive section-aware retrieval sys- tem must overcome challenges in accurately parsing document structures, prioritising relevant sections based on claim types, and efficiently handling conflicting evidence. By integrating structured document parsing, hierarchical retrieval strategies, and context- aware reasoning, future systems can leverage richer evidence from full-paper scientific literature while reducing LLM hallucinations. Advancing these techniques will enhance the reliability and inter- pretability of scientific fact-checking systems. 6 Multimodal content in Science Scientific literature often conveys key evidence using non-textual elements such as tables, charts, and figures, which are commonly used to present experimental results, statistical analyses, and the- oretical models, as shown in Figure 3. For full-text scientific fact- checking, especially across various fields of science and technol- ogy, it is crucial to move beyond text and accurately interpret these structured elements to ensure comprehensive verification. Fact-checking and misinformation detection on individual modal- ities – such as figures [ 1, 65, 66, 69, 93, 112], charts [ 4, 7], and tables [3, 13, 22, 29, 36, 57, 79, 83, 113] – has been studied inde- pendently [5]. To improve tabular reasoning, transformer-based approaches such as TAPAS [38] and Table-BERT [114] have been de- veloped. However, these techniques perform poorly in SCITAB [57], a dataset for scientific fact-checking on tables, with results barely above random. One possible cause is the lack of contextual ground- ing for tables, which are rarely self-contained. Similarly, figures and charts in scientific papers often require surrounding textual expla- nations for correct interpretation. Recent datasets like AVerImaTeC [18] address image-text verification using web-sourced data, but sci- entific domains present greater challenges: figures are densely struc- tured, often span multiple sections, and require domain-specific understanding capability. We argue that scientific fact-checking should shift toward full- paper analysis, where structured elements are interpreted along- side their textual context. Unlike standalone multimodal models, document-level processing enables cross-referencing between fig- ures/tables/charts and their descriptions, facilitating more faithful and complete verification. RD.6. Multi-modal Evidence Alignment Scientific fact-checking requires integrating evidence across multi- ple modalities, including text, tables, and figures, to ensure consis- tency and completeness. Recent multimodal information retrieval datasets in the scientific domain [ 71, 110] provide aligned pairs of textual and structured content, offering a foundation for cross- modal reasoning. However, in real scientific documents, structured elements, such as figures and tables, are not always located close to their descriptive text, making alignment a non-trivial challenge. A promising direction is to explicitly align structured elements with their corresponding textual explanations within the same document. In scientific articles, tables and figures are typically ex- plained through captions or surrounding sentences. Layout-aware parsing techniques can help identify these elements and link them to relevant text spans. Once aligned, their contents can be jointly encoded, enabling claim verification that draws on both structured data and contextual text. This alignment facilitates more coherent retrieval and reasoning across modalities, improving the reliability of multimodal fact-checking. This unified framework contrasts with traditional multimodal systems that process each modality in isolation. Effective alignment demands progress in scientific document understanding [24, 60], visual structure parsing [ 32], and domain-specific retrieval [ 71]. Integrating these efforts will support full-document, multimodal verification, where structured evidence is faithfully grounded in its textual context. 7 Credibility of scientific literature Existing evidence retrieval models often favour high-ranking doc- uments based on semantic relevance, often overlooking scientific rigour [98]. As a result, low-quality documents may be retrieved as evidence, undermining the credibility of scientific fact-checking. The reliability of a claim verification process is inherently tied to The Next Phase of Scientific Fact-Checking: Advanced Evidence Retrieval from Complex Structured Academic Papers ICTIR ’25, July 18, 2025, Padua, Italy the quality of the supporting literature, making evidence credibility a crucial factor in scientific fact-checking. In the domain of scientific literature, credibility assessment is influenced by multiple factors, including peer-review status, which ensures methodological scrutiny, citation impact which indicates how influential a study is within its field, and experimental rigour, reflecting the robustness of a study’s methodology. However, the proliferation of non-peer-reviewed manuscripts and publications from venues with varying editorial standards, particularly in open- access repositories, poses a growing challenge. Such sources may lack the rigorous methodological scrutiny necessary to ensure re- liable scientific conclusions. Therefore, incorporating additional quality indicators is essential for enhancing the robustness of sci- entific fact-checking. RD.7. Extending Indicators of Evidence Quality Evaluating scientific literature quality extends beyond content reliability, and should consider factors including venue reputa- tion, methodological rigour, and experimental transparency. High- impact journals and prestigious conferences generally enforce strin- gent peer-review standards, contributing to the credibility of pub- lished research. Similarly, the expertise and prior contributions of an author, particularly in reputable venues, can provide further insight into the credibility of a study. In addition to traditional metadata, emerging indicators such as replication status, data avail- ability, and adherence to reporting guidelines can further reflect methodological soundness. Although metadata-based credibility assessment is a useful heuristic, it is not foolproof. For example, selective reporting and statistical manipulation still exist, as some widely cited studies have later been retracted due to methodolog- ical flaws [31]. While the integration of such metadata remains a reasonable approach, as these indicators generally correlate with lit- erature quality, their limitations must be acknowledged, given that even widely cited studies can occasionally be subject to retraction due to undetected methodological flaws. 8 Scientific terminology complexity Scientific fact-checking systems often encounter challenges when aligning claims with supporting evidence due to mismatches in terminology granularity [101, 107]. The prevalence of hierarchical and synonymous scientific terms introduces significant challenges in fact verification. Many concepts exist at multiple levels of speci- ficity, where broader categories encompass more specific subtypes, leading to ambiguity in claim-evidence alignment. This issue is further exacerbated by high token-level similarity among related terms, making it difficult for models to differentiate between general and specific concepts. As a result, models often misinterpret evi- dence relevance, increasing the likelihood of incorrect verification outcomes. This issue arises when a claim uses a broad term, while the sup- porting evidence provides a more specific instance, or vice versa. As in the following example, such mismatches can lead to incor- rect veracity assignments, as existing models struggle to recognise hierarchical relationships between concepts. Claim: Cancer risk is lower in individuals with a history of alcohol consumption. Supports: Alcohol consumption was associated with a decreased risk of thyroid cancer. This issue is common within scientific fact checking and has been reported to occur within 44% of annotated examples in SciFact-Open [101]. Hence, we argue that capturing the hierarchical relationship could be a research direction to improve verification performance in the scientific domain, by solving the mismatch problem. RD.8. Hierarchical Concept Modelling To address this issue, ontology-based reasoning can be integrated into fact-checking pipelines. Structured ontologies such as MeSH [54] and UMLS [53] define hierarchical relationships that help sys- tems infer term specificity. Recognising that ‘lung cancer’ is a sub- type of ‘cancer’ enables better claim-evidence alignment, mitigat- ing errors caused by lexical similarity. Beyond that, the knowledge graph can enrich ontological reasoning by encoding both hier- archical and associative relationships among scientific concepts [39, 48]. However, its potential for resolving terminology granular- ity mismatches in scientific fact-checking remains unexplored. Ad- ditionally, representation learning techniques such as contrastive learning can embed these hierarchical relationships into vector space representations, reducing reliance on token-level similarity. Domain-specific models like SciBERT [11] and PubMedBERT [35] can further enhance contextual understanding by incorporating structured knowledge into retrieval and verification processes. By leveraging ontological reasoning, knowledge graphs, and struc- tured embeddings, scientific fact-checking systems can better align claims with relevant evidence, reducing verification errors caused by terminology granularity mismatches. In addition to enhancing precision, this also has potential to improve interpretability by making model decisions more transparent. 9 Conclusion This paper explores the evolution of scientific fact-checking method- ologies from abstract-level approaches to full-paper frameworks on large-scale corpora. As the volume and diversity of scientific knowledge continue to grow, the challenges of verifying claims across heterogeneous sources become increasingly complex. By addressing the complexities inherent in scientific literature, includ- ing its evolving nature, structured format, and the necessity for precise evidence retrieval, we underscore the importance of de- veloping specialised retrieval systems capable of managing large, multimodal, and time-sensitive evidence retrieval. Furthermore, this work proposes several research directions aimed at improving scientific fact-checking efficiency and reliability. They include the integration of time-aware evidence retrieval to ensure the use of the most relevant and up-to-date findings, adaptive document process- ing to enable context-sensitive retrieval strategies, and multi-modal evidence alignment to integrate text, tables and figures to enhance verification accuracy. Overcoming these challenges has potential to improve the accuracy of fact-checking processes and also facilitate the scalability and applicability of these systems in diverse scientific fact-checking scenarios. By bridging the gap between scientific fact- checking and effective evidence retrieval, these advancements will contribute to more robust, interpretable, and trustworthy scientific fact-checking methodologies for real-world applications.
