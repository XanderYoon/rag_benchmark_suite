Despite the impres- sive performance in complex question-answering tasks, RAG still struggles with hallucinations. Attributing RAG-generated content through in-line citations has demonstrated potential in reducing hallucinations and facilitating human verification. Existing citation generation methods primarily rely on either fine-tuning the genera- tor or employing post-processing approaches for citation matching. However, the former approach demands substantial annotated data and computational resources, while the latter often encounters dif- ficulties in managing multiple citations and frequently produces suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework, calledVeriCite, designed to rigorously validate supporting evi- dence and enhance answer attribution. Specifically,VeriCitebreaks down into a three-stage generation: 1) Theinitial answer generation first generates a response based on all available contexts and has its claims verified through the NLI model; 2) thesupporting evidence selectionassesses the utility of each document and extracts useful supporting evidences; 3) thefinal answer refinementintegrates the initial response and collected evidences to produce the final, refined answer. We conduct experiments across five open-sourceLLMs and four datasets, demonstrating that VeriCite can significantly improve citation quality while maintaining the correctness of the answers. 1 ∗Corresponding author. 1Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/QianHaosheng/VeriCite This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

VeriCite: Towards Reliable Citations in Retrieval- Augmented Generation via Rigorous Verification. InProceedings of the 2025 Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval in the Asia Pacific Region (SIGIR-AP 2025), December 7–10, 2025, Xi’an, China.ACM, New York, NY, USA, 8 pages. https://doi.org/ 10.1145/3767695.3769505 1 Introduction Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [9, 16, 30] plays a crucial role in enabling large language models (LLMs) [ 1, 19] to tackle challenges such as real-time news queries and domain-specific issues, thereby expanding the capabilities and application scope of LLMs. However, as retrieval technology is not always flawless, it simultaneously introduces new challenges for LLMs. For example, if irrelevant information is retrieved and used as a reference, the LLM may incorporate this noise and generate incorrect answers, exacerbating the hallucination issue[6, 15, 35]. Therefore, enabling LLMs to generate attributable responses is vital for ensuring trustworthiness and mitigating misinformation. An effective strategy to enhance the reliability of LLM responses is through citation mechanisms, whereby each statement is explicitly anchored to relevant source materials [5, 8, 17]. This approach not only establishes traceability by allowing users to independently verify the accuracy of responses, but also facilitates error diagnosis and promotes transparency in human-AI collaboration. arXiv:2510.11394v1 [cs.IR] 13 Oct 2025 SIGIR-AP 2025, December 7–10, 2025, Xi’an, China Haosheng et al. Current approaches for generating answers with citations can be broadly classified into two paradigms [14]. The first category, classified as “intrinsic attribution”, operates synchronously with text generation. These approaches typically treat citations as reg- ular tokens and enable LLM to directly generate citations within answers through fine-tuning or in-context learning [8, 20, 23]. Nev- ertheless, intrinsic integration approaches face several practical constraints: (1) Fine-tuning demands extensive domain-specific an- notation and significant computational resources; (2) In-context learning is highly sensitive to the input examples, leading to poor generalization performance. The other category can be classified as “extrinsic attribution”, which initially generates a draft answer and subsequently employs post-processing approaches to match retrieved passages with state- ments in the answer. Common matching methods include utilizing sentence similarity metrics such as BLEU [ 24] and ROUGE [ 18], or employing Natural Language Inference (NLI) classifiers to eval- uate entailment relationships [ 7]. Classic similarity metrics are computationally efficient, but their effectiveness is constrained by the challenge of determining thresholds. Conversely, although NLI models deliver higher accuracy, yet fundamentally struggle to han- dle cases where a single statement requires multiple citations [8]. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel frame- work namedVeriCite, which strengthens the reliability of cita- tions through rigorous verification. In contrast to previous stud- ies which primarily focused on the answer generation process or post-processing stages, VeriCite concentrates on the phase after retrieved passages are obtained but before final answer generation commences. VeriCite consists of three stages: initial answer gener- ation, supporting evidence selection, and final answer refinement (as illustrated in Figure 1). The initial answer generation stage gen- erates a response based on all retrieval passages and uses an NLI model to verify the citations in the statement, ensuring the reliabil- ity of the answer. The subsequent supporting evidence selection stage thoroughly extracts potentially useful evidence from each passage. This evidence must also undergo verification through the NLI model, and the verified evidence is then marked with citations. The final answer refinement stage integrates the initial answer and the extracted evidence, with the LLM responsible for reorganizing the order of the statements to improve fluency, removing redundant content, and merging citations. VeriCite aims to pre-screen the content within retrieved passages that is genuinely valuable for answer generation, pre-attributing citations to these high-quality segments to ensure source traceabil- ity. This preprocessing approach helps eliminate noise from the input, significantly alleviating the cognitive load on LLMs when extracting key information from long contexts. Furthermore, the strategy of pre-attributing citations reduces the model’s attribution difficulty, enabling the generator to more seamlessly and accurately reuse existing citations within the answer. Extensive experiments conducted across multiple datasets and LLMs demonstrate that while achieving answer accuracy on par with baselines, VeriCite yields a significant improvement in citation generation quality. 2 Related Work In retrieval-augmented question answering, methods for generating attributed answers typically fall into two primary categories. The first category employs “intrinsic attribution”, leveraging generative models’ inherent attribution capabilities. This approach typically utilizes supervised fine-tuning or in-context learning to enable models to produce answers with integrated citations. Among seminal implementations, WebGPT [23] enhances open- domain question answering (QA) accuracy by simulating human web browsing behavior. Built upon GPT-3 [1], this system extracts relevant webpage passages as supporting evidence and inserts ci- tations as commandS within answers. The authors trained reward models on extensive human preference annotations, optimizing answer quality through Proximal Policy Optimization [ 29]. Sub- sequent innovations include WebGLM [20], which integrates an LLM-augmented retriever, bootstrapped generator, and a human preference-aware scorer. Its automated annotation pipeline enabled large-scale training data generation, with supervised fine-tuning on citation-annotated QA data yielding robust attribution capabilities. APO [17] advances training methodology by formulating attribu- tion as preference learning and introducing a progressive optimiza- tion framework with sentence-level rewards that enhances align- ment efficiency. Distinctively, LongCite [42] tackles fine-grained citation in long-context QA through its Coarse to Fine (CoF) data construction scheme, enabling precise sentence-level attribution with superior traceability relative to passage-level alternatives. Un- like approaches requiring fine-tuning, alternative approaches em- ploy prompting to instruct models to incorporate citations during answer generation. ALCE [ 8] systematically evaluated multiple few-shot citation generation strategies, including Vanilla, Sum- mary, and Snippet. Alternative research efforts have designed more sophisticated reasoning pipelines dedicated to enabling models to perform proactive verification and citation refinement during generation. For instance, VTG [32] introduces a document storage mechanism with long short-term memory, implements an active retrieval component that generates diversified queries, and incor- porates a hierarchical verification module featuring an evidence finder to validate relationships between generated answers and their citations. Contrastingly, “extrinsic attribution” methods incorporate cita- tions during post-processing. These methods first generate an initial answer (with or without citations) using a generative model, then establish correspondences between the generated text and retrieved passages through text matching techniques, and finally insert appro- priate citations [11]. This strategy enables attribution even for mod- els lacking inherent citation capabilities. For instance, WebGLM’s automated citation annotation pipeline utilized the ROUGE-1 [18] similarity metric to evaluate citation correctness, filtering higher- quality training data. Beyond text similarity metrics, alternative approaches leverage NLI models to determine entailment relation- ships between answer sentences and retrieved passages, assigning citations based on classification results. ALCE implemented this NLI approach as a representative post-processing baseline method. Effective evaluation methodologies are indispensable for advanc- ing citation generation research, with established approaches en- compassing both human assessment and automated metrics [25, 38]. VeriCite: Towards Reliable Citations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Rigorous Verification SIGIR-AP 2025, December 7–10, 2025, Xi’an, China Figure 1: Overview of VeriCite framework. The pioneering human evaluation framework, Attributable to Iden- tified Sources (AIS) [27], measures textual faithfulness to source materials through a structured protocol: annotators first exam- ine model-generated text to determine whether each statement requires external source substantiation, then verify (1) the presence of explicit source attribution, and (2) content consistency between generated claims and corresponding source materials. While hu- man evaluation offers superior accuracy, its significant drawbacks include high labor costs and low efficiency. To address these chal- lenges, researchers proposed AutoAIS [7] based on AIS, which lever- ages NLI models to approximate human judgment. This automated approach refines evaluation granularity to the sentence level by examining entailment relationships between responses and source materials. Building upon this foundation, ALCE redefines citation recall and citation precision metrics while establishing the first benchmark for LLM attribution evaluation. This benchmark incor- porates multi-dimensional evaluation of fluency, correctness, and citation quality. Further advancing the field, CAQA [13] introduces a comprehensive four-category framework (Supported, Insufficient, Contradictory, Irrelevant) for fine-grained attribution evaluation, enabling more precise quantification of attribution performance. 3 VeriCite framework 3.1 Task Formulation Following previous work [8, 20], the formal description of this task is as follows: Given a query 𝑞, top-𝑘 passages 𝑃={𝑝 1, 𝑝2, . . . , 𝑝𝑘 } are retrieved, and the LLM needs to generate an answer 𝐴. The answer 𝐴 consists of several statements 𝐴={𝑠 1, 𝑠2, . . .} . Each statement 𝑠𝑖 may cite a set of passages 𝐶𝑖 ={𝑐 𝑖1, 𝑐𝑖2, . . .} , where 𝑐𝑖 𝑗 ∈ [1, 𝑘] ∩Z. 3.2 Initial Answer Generation The initial answer generation phase follows standard RAG method- ology [16], where the query 𝑞 and all top- 𝑘 retrieved passages {𝑝1, 𝑝2, . . . , 𝑝𝑘 } are concatenated into a single input sequence for the LLM, producing an initial answer𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡_𝑎𝑛𝑠. 𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡_𝑎𝑛𝑠=𝐴𝑛𝑠𝑤𝑒𝑟(𝑞, 𝑝 1, 𝑝2, . . . , 𝑝𝑘 )(1) At this stage, we employ a few-shot instruction template to provide in-context learning examples, guiding the LLM to learn the citation patterns demonstrated in the exemplars. This approach explicitly requires the model to incorporate citations within each answer statement. The instruction template at this stage is shown in Appendix A.1. This phase aims to produce a foundational answer for subsequent refinement, requiring only citation incorporation without additional model constraints. While contemporary LLMs excel at answering simple commonsense queries, they inevitably exhibit hallucination tendencies when confronted with complex problems. To enhance answer reliability, we implement a rigorous verifi- cation and filtering mechanism. During initial answer validation, unsupported content must be systematically eliminated, retaining exclusively evidence-substantiated answer statements. To facili- tate granular reliability verification, the initial answer 𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡_𝑎𝑛𝑠 is decomposed into a set of statements {𝑠1, 𝑠2, . . .} , where each statement 𝑠𝑖 is associated with a potentially empty set of cita- tions {𝑐𝑖1, 𝑐𝑖2, . . .} . The verification process employs a NLI model 𝜙 trained for Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) tasks [2, 41], which predicts whether a hypothesis is entailed by, contradicts, or is neutral to given premises. Specifically, for each statement𝑠𝑖, we validate whether the corresponding retrieval passages {𝑝𝑐𝑖 𝑗 } (premises) entail the statement𝑠 𝑖 (hypothesis). 𝑠𝑢𝑝𝑖 =𝜙(𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑎𝑡(𝑝 𝑐𝑖 𝑗 ), 𝑠𝑖 )(2) The verification outcome 𝑠𝑢𝑝𝑖 is binary-valued: when the model determines that the answer statement 𝑠𝑖 is entailed by (a combina- tion of) the retrieved passages, 𝑠𝑢𝑝𝑖 is assignedTrue; otherwise, it returnsFalse, indicating an unsupported statement likely contain- ing hallucinated content that consequently fails verification and must be discarded. 3.3 Supporting Evidence Selection Irrelevant information can interfere with theLLM’s response gener- ation, potentially causing critical relevant details to be overlooked. While conventional RAG approaches generate answers based on coarsely aggregated retrieval results, our methodology addition- ally incorporates fine-grained evidence extraction. This necessity SIGIR-AP 2025, December 7–10, 2025, Xi’an, China Haosheng et al. - Settings ASQA ELI5 HotpotQA MuSiQue Dataset statistics Task Long-form QA Long-form QA Multihop QA Multihop QA Question Type Factoid How/Why/What Factoid Factoid # Examples 948 1000 500 500 Evaluation metrics Correctness EM Recall Claim Recall EM Recall EM Recall Citation Quality Citation Recall, Citation Precision, Citation F1 Table 1: Statistics of different datasets. arises from the fundamental misalignment between retriever and generator objectives in standard RAG pipelines [21]. These distinct models often exhibit mutually incompatible relevance judgments. Retrievers may introduce either irrelevant information or seemingly relevant but non-actionable content, both of which can cause gen- erators to overlook genuinely critical information while producing noise-degraded outputs. Inspired by recent studies [ 26, 28, 33], our evidence selection phase leverages the LLM’s robust natural language understanding capabilities to collaborate with the retriever in context extraction. This dual engagement strategy comprehensively excavates poten- tially valuable content that might otherwise be overlooked within each passage. Specifically, the LLM first independently evaluates each retrieved passage’s utility for answering the query using the instruction template depicted in Appendix A.2. 𝑟𝑒𝑙 𝑖 =𝐶ℎ𝑒𝑐𝑘(𝑞, 𝑝 𝑖 )(3) Following the LLM’s secondary verification of passage utility, retained passages (𝑟𝑒𝑙 𝑖 =𝑇 𝑟𝑢𝑒 ) proceed to evidence selection. The generator then independently produces answers for each qualifying passage𝑝 𝑖 using the instruction template shown in Appendix A.3. 𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑖 =  𝐴𝑛𝑠𝑤𝑒𝑟(𝑞, 𝑝 𝑖 ), 𝑟𝑒𝑙 𝑖 =𝑇 𝑟𝑢𝑒 𝑁 𝑜𝑛𝑒 , 𝑟𝑒𝑙 𝑖 =𝐹𝑎𝑙𝑠𝑒 (4) Like other texts generated by LLMs, 𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑖 remains prone to hallucination issues, necessitating further verification of its en- tailment relationship with the corresponding original passage 𝑝𝑖. Similar to the previous phase, the verification process decomposes 𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑖 into statements {𝑠𝑖1, 𝑠𝑖2, . . .} . We then employ the NLI model 𝜙 to verify whether the original retrieval passage entails these statements. 𝑠𝑢𝑝𝑖 𝑗 =𝜙(𝑝 𝑖, 𝑠𝑖 𝑗)(5) Statements 𝑠𝑖 𝑗 verified by the NLI model as entailed by passage 𝑝𝑖 are retained for subsequent summarization and automatically annotated with the corresponding citation marker “[i]”. This design fundamentally decouples attribution from generation during the summarization phase. Final answer citations directly reuse these pre-process markers rather than relying on the generator’s attri- bution capabilities, thereby significantly reducing demands on the LLM’s citation capacity. 3.4 Final Answer Refinement Following rigorous collection and verification procedures in the preceding stages, we obtain a curated set of semantically validated statements {𝑠1, 𝑠2, . . .} accompanied by their corresponding citation sets {𝑐1 ={𝑐 11, 𝑐12, . . .}, 𝑐 2 ={𝑐 21, 𝑐22, . . .}, . . .} . While these com- ponents exhibit high reliability due to rigorous verification, their inherent fragmentation and potential redundancy render them un- suitable for direct concatenation into a coherent final response. The refinement phase fundamentally redefines the large language model’s role rather than directly addressing the query or making at- tribution decisions, the model now functions as a synthesis engine. This engine processes the verified statements and citations as foun- dational input material, executing three critical transformations: restructuring logical flow and sentence sequencing to enhance co- herence, eliminating redundant content to improve conciseness, and strategically consolidating citations to optimize referential clarity. 𝑓 𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙_𝑎𝑛𝑠=𝑅𝑒 𝑓 𝑖𝑛𝑒(𝑞, 𝑃, 𝑠 1, 𝑐1, 𝑠2, 𝑐2, . . .)(6) To mitigate potential referential ambiguity and ensure contex- tual fidelity, the original retrieved passages are incorporated into the model’s input stream. This architectural choice provides es- sential grounding context, enabling more accurate interpretation of statement semantics and preventing summarization errors aris- ing from ambiguous references. Furthermore, explicit instructional constraints mandate that the model preserve the original semantic content of input statements without modification while simultane- ously ensuring the final output maintains both informational com- pleteness and fluent logical progression. The model must achieve this dual objective through careful rhetorical reorganization rather than content alteration. The instruction template at this stage is shown in Appendix A.4. 4 Experiments 4.1 Datasets and Models To comprehensively evaluate our method’s effectiveness across diverse question types, we conduct experiments on four bench- mark datasets. The long-form QA datasets include ASQA [31], an ambiguity-aware factual dataset distinguished from conventional benchmarks by its exclusive focus on ambiguous questions sourced from AmbigQA [22]. Each query admits multiple valid interpre- tations, necessitating models to recognize inherent ambiguities and synthesize comprehensive responses using evidentiary support. Complementing this, ELI5 [4] comprises predominantly non-factual questions originating from Reddit’s “Explain Like I’m Five”2 forum. Characterized by complexhow,why, andwhatqueries, this dataset presents significant challenges in generating logically coherent, information-rich long-form explanations. For multi-hop reasoning evaluation, we employ HotpotQA [ 40] and MuSiQue [ 36]. Hot- potQA features curated factual questions requiring cross-document 2https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive VeriCite: Towards Reliable Citations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Rigorous Verification SIGIR-AP 2025, December 7–10, 2025, Xi’an, China evidence integration through manually designed multi-step reason- ing. Conversely, MuSiQue contains synthetically generated factual questions formed by composing single-hop queries, typically de- manding 2-4 inference steps. This automated composition process yields linguistically structured questions that present heightened analytical difficulty relative to conventional benchmarks. The ASQA and ELI5 datasets are subsets released by ALCE [8], while HotpotQA and MusiQue are subsets released by IRCOT [37]. Each dataset is evaluated in terms of answer correctness and ci- tation quality. Among these, we use the EM (Exact Match) Recall metric to evaluate the answer correctness for the ASQA, HotpotQA, and MusiQue datasets, use Claim Recall to evaluate the answer correctness for the ELI5 dataset, and use Citation F1 to evaluate the citation quality for all datasets. Dataset details are summarized in Table 1. Experiments were conducted on five open-source LLMs: Llama3- 8B-Instruct [3], Gemma-2-9B-it [34], GLM-4-9B-Chat [10], Qwen2.5- 7B-Instruct [39], and Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct. 4.2 Baselines For baseline comparisons, we selected four established approaches: • Vanilla[ 8]: The query and top- 𝑘 retrieved passages are concatenated to form the model input. Task-specific instruc- tions coupled with in-context learning mechanisms guide the generation of answers with integrated citations. This approach represents the foundational methodology for at- tribution generation, processing retrieved passages without additional refinement. • Summary[ 8]: Retrieved passages undergo summarization- based compression prior to model input. These summarized compressions are concatenated with the original query and processed through identical task-specific instructions and in-context learning mechanisms to guide the generation of answers with integrated citations. This approach intention- ally mitigates textual redundancy in model inputs, enhancing focus on salient information. • Snippet[ 8]: Contrasting with the Summary approach, this methodology employs extractive summarization for model input. This methodology preserves exact expressions from retrieved passages, thereby circumventing potential seman- tic distortion inherent in abstractive summarization. • APO[ 17]: Automatic Preference Optimization framework enhances model performance through a dual-phase approach: supervised fine-tuning followed by preference optimization. During the preference optimization phase, a novel loss func- tion is implemented to enable fine-grained sentence-level rewards, facilitating more efficient model parameter updates. 4.3 Implementation Settings In the experiment, the top-5retrieved passages are provided for each query, and each method is given two few-shot examples for in- context learning. In the VeriCite method, we use TRUE [12] as the NLI model for citation verification. To ensure the reproducibility of the experiment, allLLMs generate responses using greedy decoding. 4.4 Main Results Our experimental results, as shown in Table 2. On the ASQA dataset, VeriCite exhibits a clear advantage in an- swer correctness across all five models, outperforming all baseline methods. Notably, the GLM-4 model delivers the most substantial improvement with a 4.54% increase in correctness over the best performing Vanilla baseline. Regarding citation quality, Llama3 and Qwen2.5 models achieve significant enhancements in citation F1, surpassing the strongest baseline. In contrast, Gemma-2 and GLM-4 perform marginally below their respective optimal baselines in this metric. For the ELI5 dataset, VeriCite underperforms relative to the more robust baselines in answer correctness across all five models, indi- cating potential limitations in its answer generation mechanism for non-factoid questions. It is noteworthy that the extensively fine-tuned APO baseline demonstrates strong correctness here, exhibiting only minor degradation with the GLM-4 model. Con- versely, VeriCite achieves substantial gains in citation quality, with all five models exceeding the best baseline by an average margin of 11.41% in Citation F1 score, thereby validating its efficacy for citation optimization. On multi-hop QA datasets, VeriCite shows a pronounced im- provement in answer correctness exclusively with the Qwen2.5 model, which surpasses all other baselines. However, its perfor- mance with the remaining three models falls slightly below their respective best baselines. This observation suggests that VeriCite’s supporting evidence selection stage may be suboptimal for multi- hop scenarios requiring cross-passage information integration, highlighting a potential area for architectural refinement. Despite this, all models exhibit exceptional citation quality, significantly outperforming the strongest baselines in Citation F1 scores. Overall, the results indicate that VeriCite matches or exceeds the best baselines in answer correctness, with particularly notable gains observed for the Qwen2.5 and GLM-4 models. Simultaneously, citation quality was significantly enhanced across all five models compared to the best baseline performances. Furthermore, both parameter scales of the Qwen2.5 model exhibited similar improve- ments, suggesting that the proposed method retains its potential for application to larger-scale models. 5 Analysis 5.1 Ablation Study This section presents an ablation study conducted on the VeriCite framework to evaluation the contribution of its core components. Experiments were performed using the Llama3-8B-Instruct model on the ASQA dataset. Three specific ablation variants were investigated. The first vari- ant omits the initial answer generation stage; consequently, the final answer is generated exclusively utilizing statements derived from the supporting evidence selection stage. The second variant removes the supporting evidence selection stage, with the final answer organized solely based on statements obtained from the initial answer generation stage. The third variant eliminates the NLI based verification module employed in both the initial answer generation and supporting evidence selection stages. Under this condition, all generated statements are assumed to be supported SIGIR-AP 2025, December 7–10, 2025, Xi’an, China Haosheng et al.

The results detailed in Table 3 reveal significant insights. The removal of either the initial answer generation stage or the support- ing evidence selection stage induces a substantial decline in answer correctness. In contrast, the detrimental effect on citation quality resulting from these omissions is comparatively less pronounced. This observation indicates that statements originating from both stages possess a complementary nature, collectively contributing to the comprehensiveness of the final answer. Conversely, the ablation of the NLI verification module demonstrates a negligible impact on answer correctness. However, this removal causes a severe deterio- ration in citation quality. This finding underscores the critical role of the verification step in ensuring the reliability of the citations within the final answer.

Recognizing that general LLMs possess substantial natural language understanding capabilities, employing the same LLM to perform both answer generation and statement verification tasks within VeriCite offers a promising avenue for significantly reducing framework complexity. Consequently, we in- vestigate an integrated approach where a single LLM is tasked with generating answers and verifying the support for individual state- ments within retrieved passages. This verification is implemented by instructing the model to output a binary judgment (“Yes” or “No”) regarding whether each statement is supported by its correspond- ing passage. Furthermore, the experimental design incorporates the current SOTA LLM, DeepSeek-R1, specifically for the verification task. The comparative evaluation utilized the Llama3-8B-Instruct model exclusively for answer generation and evaluated the effec- tiveness of these three distinct verifier configurations—namely, the VeriCite: Towards Reliable Citations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Rigorous Verification SIGIR-AP 2025, December 7–10, 2025, Xi’an, China LLM verifier, the DeepSeek-R1 verifier, and the NLI verifier—on a randomly selected subset of 200 samples from the ASQA dataset. Experimental results present in Table 4. Utilizing a general LLM for dual-role verification proved detrimental, leading to a noticeable decline in both answer correctness and citation quality relative to the NLI verifier. In contrast, the DeepSeek-R1 verifier achieved a marginal improvement in answer correctness compared to the NLI verifier, while its impact on citation quality was nearly equivalent. In terms of computational efficiency, while the LLM and NLI veri- fiers are comparable in both parameter sizes and operational costs, their practical deployment costs are substantially lower than those of the large-scale DeepSeek-R1 model. Therefore, based on this empirical evaluation balancing perfor- mance gains against resource expenditure, selecting the NLI model for the verification role emerges as the optimal choice, offering an effective and cost-efficient solution. 6 Conclusion In this paper, we propose VeriCite, a novel framework designed to enhance citation quality in RAG systems. The framework operates through three sequential stages: initial answer generation, support- ing evidence selection, and final answer refinement. Experimental results demonstrate that VeriCite significantly enhances citation quality while maintaining answer correctness comparable to the strongest baseline methods. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm the necessity of each core component within the framework. Addi- tionally, the paper discusses the critical importance of selecting a NLI model for the verification role, providing justification for this design choice.
