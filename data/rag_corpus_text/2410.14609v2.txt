DiSCo: LLM Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Sparse Retrieval in Conversational Search Simon Lupart University of Amsterdam Amsterdam, Netherlands s.c.lupart@uva.nl Mohammad Aliannejadi University of Amsterdam Amsterdam, Netherlands m.aliannejadi@uva.nl Evangelos Kanoulas University of Amsterdam Amsterdam, Netherlands e.kanoulas@uva.nl Abstract Conversational Search (CS) involves retrieving relevant documents from a corpus while considering the conversational context, inte- grating retrieval with context modeling. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced CS by enabling query rewriting based on conversational context. How- ever, employing LLMs during inference poses efficiency challenges. Existing solutions mitigate this issue by distilling embeddings de- rived from human-rewritten queries, focusing primarily on learning the context modeling task. These methods, however, often separate the contrastive retrieval task from the distillation process, treating it as an independent loss term. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DiSCo (Distillation of Sparse Conversational retrieval), a novel approach that unifies retrieval and context modeling through a relaxed distillation objective. Instead of relying exclusively on representation learning, our method distills similarity scores be- tween conversations and documents, providing more freedom in the representation space and better leveraging the contrastive na- ture of document relevance. Extensive experiments on Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) across five CS datasets demonstrate that DiSCo achieves substantial improvements in both in-domain and out-of-domain retrieval tasks, achieving up to a six-point gain in recall for out-of-domain datasets over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, DiSCo employs a multi-teacher distillation strategy, using multiple LLMs as teachers, further enhancing performance and surpassing the individual teachers in in-domain settings. Fur- thermore, analysis of model sparsity reveals that DiSCo allows for more effective control over the sparsity of the trained models.

The goal of the CS task is to retrieve relevant documents from a corpus within a conversational context, in response to the user’s latest utterance. While sharing similarities with ad-hoc retrieval, the main challenge ofCS remains to model the conversational context [8, 54, 64]. More specifically, as the conversation advances, the context becomes longer and noisier, often with topic switches and language ambiguities, making the last user utterance complex to resolve and understand for retrieval systems [2, 10, 18]. Training retrieval models for this task is, however, challenging, because of the lack of large-scale conversational datasets, mak- ing human annotation an essential component of the process. In particular, a lot of effort has been invested first to create conversa- tions with passage relevance judgment [3, 10], and then to rewrite for each user utterance the contextualized version of each query (rewritten query) as the optimal denoised query of each turn [14]. Datasets with rewrites enable us to learn the Conversational Query arXiv:2410.14609v2 [cs.IR] 15 May 2025 SIGIR ’25, July 13–18, 2025, Padua, Italy Simon Lupart, Mohammad Aliannejadi, and Evangelos Kanoulas Rewriting (CQR) task by auto-regressive models (e.g., T5 [55]), and then only pass the rewritten queries to retrieval models instead of the full noisy conversations. However, this two-step approach – rewrite and retrieve – is not efficient [65], and may lead to infor- mation loss and error within the rewrite phase that can propagate to the retrieval phase. Hence, the need for unified retrieval models that do both tasks together in the representation space [46, 52]. Approaches such as ConvDR [65], coSPLADE [19] and LeCoRe [42] all learn both conversational context modeling and retrieval tasks within the representation space, either in a dense or sparse embedding space. As illustrated in Figure 1, they use a distillation objective enforcing the conversation representations to converge to the representations of gold human-rewritten queries (red arrow in the figure). This objective is, however, restrictive and assumes gold-rewritten query representations are theonly optimal rewriting and only learning target in the representations space, leaving little freedom for the model to further learn and optimize the represen- tations. DiSCo, differently from ConvDR relaxes the distillation targeting an entire hyperplane (blue hyperplane in the figure) in- stead of a single representation. This is achieved by focusing on query document similarity scores, rather than solely on the rewrite. Besides, previous work [19, 42, 65] distills query rewrite indepen- dently from the ranking objective. We thus propose to fill this gap, with a single distillation loss that unifies both context modeling and ranking tasks, while not limiting the model to learn one single representation. Our method learns to distill the similarity scores between rewrit- ten queries and documents rather than query representations di- rectly. By distilling similarities, we first align with the contrastive nature of the ranking task [36, 57, 58], but we also relax the training objective toward the final goal of retrieval, which is to compute similarities between queries and documents [24, 56, 59]. This relax- ation allows the student to further learn the context modeling task, considering relevant and irrelevant documents from the corpus, rather than mapping all representations to the human representa- tions. This objective also follows the precepts from Hofstätter et al. [20] on distillation for ad-hoc retrieval and can benefit from hard negatives within the distillation loss. Both dense and sparse meth- ods could be subject to this relaxation; however, in this work, we focus on learned sparse architectures [66], such as SPLADE [15, 31], as the relaxation would have more degrees of freedom due to the high dimensionality of the representations for LSR. Besides, the proposed relaxation also reduces the level of con- straints on the teachers, as any method producing similarity scores could be used for the distillation. In the context of CS, this allows the model to learn from multiple LLM rewrites, by fusing simi- larity scores of several teachers into a single score to be distilled. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to distill the knowledge of multiple LLM teachers for query rewriting. This also distinguishes our method from the work from Hofstätter et al. [20], as we distill from LLM knowledge through the rewrites. Through our work, we make the following contributions: • We propose DiSCo, a relaxation of the training objective of CS model distilling similarities of rewritten queries rather than representations. 1 1Models checkpoints and code at https://github.com/SimonLupart/disco-conv-splade • We propose to distill knowledge from multiple teachers, un- locking the potential of mixtures of LLMs in CS. • We evaluate the effectiveness of DiSCo on in-domain (QReCC, TopiOCQA) and out-of-domain (CAsT 2020, 2022, and iKAT 2023) datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance. • We analyze the sparsity of the learned representations com- pared to those of the original teacher models, and demon- strate the efficiency gains of the approach. Our results demonstrate that our Distillation of Sparse Con- versational retrieval, DiSCo, leads to in-domain performance im- provements, through our relaxation of the distillation loss. We also see improved generalization capacities with 12% gains on recall and 16% on precision compared to previous zero-shot models (LeCoRe and QRACDR) on CAsT 2020. We demonstrate that distilling from multiple LLM teachers for the query rewriting task brings further performance gains, compared to single LLM teacher. Finally, thanks to the increased freedom on the representations, we show that we can better control the model sparsity, even for long contexts, in deeper turns of the conversations. 2 Related Work Conversational Search (CS)differentiates itself from ad-hoc search primarily through the nature of the input. Conversational history can grow very long with turns’ dependencies, whereas search en- gine queries are typically concise, limited to a few words [ 6, 39]. The main challenge in addressingCS is modeling the conversational context, to only represent useful information from the previous turns [61]. Two possibilities exist to learn this noise reduction: first on the token level, with generative models that learn to generate contextualized queries from past conversations [14], or within the representation spaces [65] of retrieval models [44]. Query rewriting. Learning to resolve the conversational history is difficult, as no or very few conversational search engines are in production today, limiting the availability of user-interaction data. The effort is thus mostly based on human-annotated data. One of the first conversational datasets are QuAC [7] and ORConvQA [53], where human annotators were tasked to create conversations out of existing documents, assuming a human-machine conversation over the topic of the document. Each paragraph could potentially be an utterance and relevant passages would be inferred by construction. Later CANARD [14] was released on top of ORConvQA, consist- ing of human rewrites of each utterance of the conversations, to help learn the context modeling task. This defined one of the main sub-tasks of CS: Conversational Query Rewriting (CQR) [14, 64]. Following studies learned the CQR task at the token level – gener- ating automatic query rewrites based on the conversation history – on autoregressive language models (e.g., T5 or BART) [ 40, 61]. Similar methods [45] used language models to answer the query, before resolving the context. Today, work is still being done to solve the CQR task, using LLMs in zero- or few-shot fashion. CHIQ [43] proposes to decompose the context modeling task into several simpler sub-tasks for the LLMs – history enhancement, answer generation, question disambiguation – to gain in interpretability and effectiveness, LLM4CS aggregates several rewrites and answers within the representation space of the retrieval models [41], and DiSCo: LLM Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Sparse Retrieval in Conversational Search SIGIR ’25, July 13–18, 2025, Padua, Italy MQ4CS focuses on multi-aspect query rewrites [1]. However, con- text modeling using LLMs is too computationally costly, making it impossible for production. Distillation in CS. Lots of research aims at modeling the conver- sational context via learning to represent the conversation based on gold rewritten queries. Existing methods achieve this goal by taking the representation of the rewritten gold query as a teacher model and learning to distill the representation [ 19, 42, 46, 65]. ConvDR [65] learns the mapping between full conversation and human rewrites representations by minimizing an Mean Square Error (MSE) loss on the CLS tokens of both, performing well for dense bi-encoders. QRACDR [46], also proposes a similar distilla- tion, with several new MSE terms, between documents and queries to improve the representations and better align with the contrastive nature of the task. We differentiate from these works as we inspire from contrastive margin distillation (Margin-MSE [20]) and relax the query rewriting distillation by learning based on the relevance scores (i.e., the dot product of the query representation and a doc- ument), rather than the representation itself. This way, not only do we enable converging towards indefinite possible query repre- sentations, but also we take advantage of the contrastive nature of ranking by aligning the rewrite task to retrieval. Furthermore, we are not bound to one query or one teacher. Learned sparse representation. As Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) gained popularity in ad-hoc retrieval [28, 29, 31], SPLADE ar- chitectures were proposed for conversational passage retrieval [19, 37, 42], to benefit their interpretability and robustness proper- ties [16, 17, 38]. In coSPLADE [19], the authors use an MSE loss between full conversation and human rewrite representations of the sparse bag-of-words representations (of dimension 30k), and show promising performance. In the meantime, LeCoRe [42] also aims to distill human rewrites on sparse representations, through interme- diate embedding layers and by filtering a maximum of dimensions, to avoid the MSE on large dimensionality vectors. Distilling sparse representations is, however, challenging, as it requires controlling which dimensions should be activated, often restricting the po- tential of the sparse representations. Additionally, using a MSE is problematic since it treats each dimension separately, neglecting the significance of the associated dimension. These issues limit the effectiveness of sparse retrieval in previous work. In our work, by only distilling end scores, we give the model complete freedom to learn which dimensions to activate. We also investigate sparsity further, including methods to control it within CS. 3 Proposed Method In this section, we first recall notations from the CS and LSR fields, before presenting DiSCo and our relaxed distillation objective. 3.1 Preliminaries Notation. We consider a set of conversations between a user and a system, each composed of multiple turns. At turn 𝑛, we have access to previous queries and answers, together with the final user utterance 𝑞𝑛. We denote the full conversational context as 𝑞𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣 , separated with [SEP] tokens, and 𝑞𝑟 𝑤 as the gold rewritten query. 𝑞𝑟 𝑤 resolves various complexities such as ellipsis and ambiguities user utterance 1answer 1user utterance 2 LLM rewrites LLM rewrite Teachers Student!!"#$ !"!($"#$%) !!($&') !((&) !!!"=#!(%"#)#$(') =#(!(%%&'()#$(') )*++=,-.(!!#$%&,!!!") !!#$%& Figure 2: DiSCo, as the Distillation of LLM rewritten queries through a contrastive objective. Previous works distilled rep- resentations themselves, while our approach distills similar- ities with documents from the corpus, relaxing the learning objective. of the conversation and can be generated by either human or LLM. 𝑞𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣 = 𝑞𝑛, 𝑎𝑛−1, 𝑞𝑛−1, ..., 𝑎0, 𝑞0 . Furthermore, similarly to other approaches in CS [19, 42, 46, 65] we rely on two already trained encoder models 𝐸𝑞 and 𝐸𝑑, for queries and documents representations. These backbone models are trained on a large-scale IR dataset with regular short-form queries extracted from search engine logs. We also follow the assumption made in CS that 𝐸𝑑 is already good at representing documents and doesn’t need further fine-tuning, only𝐸𝑞 needs further fine-tuning to adapt to long conversational contexts, noted ˜𝐸𝑞. This can be done with a contrastive InfoNCE [48] loss on the CS datasets (e.g., convANCE, convSPLADE), or with a distillation loss (e.g., ConvDR and other distillation approaches such as DiSCo). Learned Sparse Retrieval. We rely on the SPLADE architec- ture [15, 17], based on the BERT pretrained transformers [12, 34]. SPLADE makes use of the Masked Language Modeling embedding layer of BERT to create sparse representations, where each dimen- sion corresponds to a token of the vocabulary. 𝐸𝑞, 𝐸𝑑 and ˜𝐸𝑞 are the MLM outputs of the model, of dimension 30k (vocabulary di- mension). To control the sparsity of the model, the authors propose to use a regularization loss [50], The sparsity of the models can be controlled with the two hyperparameters 𝜆𝑞 and 𝜆𝑑, as weights for the regularization loss. As we rely on the same SPLADE model, we also included this loss. 3.2 DiSCo We describe our distillation process in Figure 2. The conversation is passed through the teacher model, rewriting the last user utterance, and computing similarities with several documents from the corpus. Meanwhile, the student encodes the full conversation and scores it with those documents. The final training objective for the student is to match the teacher similarity scores. This relaxes the previous objective, which distilled representations directly. Representation distillation. Existing approaches [19, 42, 46, 65] distill query rewrites on the representation space, with a direct con- straint on the representation. The goal is to have the representations of the full conversations converging toward the representations of SIGIR ’25, July 13–18, 2025, Padua, Italy Simon Lupart, Mohammad Aliannejadi, and Evangelos Kanoulas StudentTraining score TeacherInference 1 2 !!"

Then the student query encoder ˜𝐸𝑞 is trained to reproduce the output scores of the teacher. the rewritten queries: ˜𝐸𝑞 (𝑞𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣 ) → 𝐸𝑞 (𝑞𝑟 𝑤) . (1) Relaxation of the distillation. In our work, we propose to dis- till the scores rather than the representations. This allows for a relaxation of the training objective. Instead of forcing ˜𝐸𝑞 (𝑞𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣 ) to converge to 𝐸𝑞 (𝑞𝑟 𝑤), we allow the entire hyperplane on which the similarity for 𝑞𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣 and 𝑞𝑟 𝑤 with an anchor document 𝑑 is equal: ˜𝐸𝑞 (𝑞𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣 ) → { 𝑋 ∈ Rℎ | 𝑋 ⊤𝐸𝑑 (𝑑) = 𝑠𝑞𝑟 𝑤 } , (2) with targeted scores 𝑠𝑞𝑟 𝑤 = 𝐸𝑞 (𝑞𝑟 𝑤)⊤𝐸𝑑 (𝑑), and ℎ the dimension of the representation space. More intuitively, while the existing dis- tillation loss functions bound the model to converge to one single embedding [65], our loss allows for infinite possible optimum em- beddings, as long as they have the same dot product with the target relevant document embedding (i.e., any point in the hyperplane). Such distillation on scores can be trained with a Kullback Leibler Divergence loss [25] on the distribution of scores: LKLD = 𝐷KL (S𝑞𝑟 𝑤 || S𝑞𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣 ) , (3) where S𝑞𝑟 𝑤 and S𝑞𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣 are the distributions of similarity scores within the batch. It differs from the existing learning objective which is achieved with an MSE loss on each dimension of the vector representations independently [19, 65]: LMSE = MSE( ˜𝐸𝑞 (𝑞𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣 ), 𝐸 𝑞 (𝑞𝑟 𝑤)) . (4) This new LKLD loss includes the benefit of the contrastive objective, anchoring itself on relevant and hard documents from the corpus. Also note that in the previous optimization, the final loss was the sum of the distillation MSE loss with the contrastive InfoNCE loss, while we only use a single contrastive distillation KLD loss, unifying both objectives into one distillation loss. Figure 3 illustrates the distillation process. First, the teacher retrieves documents using the rewritten queries and stores the similarity scores. Then, the student model encodes the full conversation, learning to have equal similarities to the teacher on these documents, by minimizing the KLD distillation loss. This defines the final learning objective of our DiSCo models, as minimizing the distributions of scores between the student and teacher models. Hard negatives. As our new training objective from Equation 3 is now contrastive, we can benefit from hard negative mining. This was not possible with the previous distillation objective, as it only uses conversation representations, independently from documents. Thus applied to the case of multiple negatives per query, the target space from Equation 2 becomes a subspace of (h-N) dimen- sions. This still keeps a higher degree of freedom, since the number of negatives is much lower than the dimension of the embedding space (ℎ >> 𝑁 ). {𝑋 ∈ Rℎ | 𝑋 ⊤𝐸𝑑 (𝑑𝑖 ) = 𝑠𝑖 𝑞𝑟 𝑤 ∀𝑖 ∈ [ 1, 𝑁 ]} , (5) with 𝑠𝑖𝑞𝑟 𝑤 = 𝐸𝑞 (𝑞𝑟 𝑤)⊤𝐸𝑑 (𝑑𝑖 ) being the scores from multiple hard negatives. These negatives are mined during the Teacher Inference step from Figure 3, further improving training objective [16, 63]. Teacher Models. An important component of distillation relies on the choice of the teacher. The teacher is first used to rewrite the conversation utterance, into 𝑞𝑟 𝑤, which will be encoded 𝐸𝑞 (𝑞𝑟 𝑤) and distilled through the similarities scores 𝑠𝑞𝑟 𝑤. We use multiple LLMs, together with human rewrite (when available), as teachers. Having several teachers is motivated by the well-established effec- tiveness of ensembling strategies, where stronger teachers would provide higher-quality training signals, leading to better student model performance. This results in several trained DiSCo students, depending on the teacher used. Below we list all the teachers: • T0: T5QR • T1: LlamaQR • T2: MistralQR • T3: HumanQR Furthermore, another property of the proposed distillation is that we can distill from multiple teachers, making the distill from several LLMs or humans possible. We do so by averaging the similarity scores of the 𝑇 teachers, each having a different rewrite, thus a different similarity with the documents. We experimented with mean, min, and max aggregation methods, observing no significant differences in performance, and thus decided to use the more simple mean aggregation. Overall, the distilled score is: 𝑠𝑞𝑟 𝑤𝑎𝑙𝑙 = 𝑠𝑞rw1 + 𝑠𝑞rw2 + · · · +𝑠𝑞rw𝑇 𝑇 . (6) The final learning objective of our DiSCo multi-teacher is the same as for the regular DiSCo (i.e., KLD from Equation 3), but distilling the average score of the set of teachers, instead of using a single similarity from a unique teacher. Student-Teacher Fusion. Finally, we propose a fusion of the teacher and the student model, combining the ranked lists of both at inference. This is achieved using an average normalized score over the ranked list of both models. 4 Experiments Design 4.1 Datasets and Metrics Datasets. We evaluate our method’s effectiveness on various con- versational passage retrieval datasets, detailed in Table 1, namely: • QReCC [4] is built upon ORConvQA [53], NQ [26] and TREC CAsT 2019 [ 10]. It features 13K conversations and 80K turns created by human annotators around existing documents. • TopiOCQA [2] distinguishes itself from QReCC focusing on topic switches, where every Wikipedia hyperlink is considered a DiSCo: LLM Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Sparse Retrieval in Conversational Search SIGIR ’25, July 13–18, 2025, Padua, Italy Table 1: Statistics of the datasets.

They are coupled with high-quality relevance judgements done by NIST assessors. Effectiveness Metrics. We report the results in terms of the main IR metrics [42, 65], as well as official TREC CAsT and iKAT ones [3, 10]. Metrics are Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Normalized Dis- counted Cumulative Gain (nDCG) [22] at 3. As we focus on first- stage retrieval, we also include Recall at different ranks [62]. We determine the statistically significant differences by doing a two- sided paired t-test with Bonferroni correction at 95% confidence (𝑝 < 0.05). Efficiency Metrics. In terms of inference efficiency, we report the number of LLM inference calls when used for query rewriting, as it is a strong indicator of inference latency. As an example, it takes an average of 4.4 seconds to generate 64 tokens on Llama 3.1, on A100 GPU, while the typical dual-encoder retrieval latency is in the range of 100 milliseconds on CPU [27, 30, 32]. We also provide Rewrite and Retrieval efficiency, of several mod- els. This is performed per query, averaged over the entire test set. Rewrite is the latency for rewriting, while retrieval is both query encoding and search through the inverted index (in the case of SPLADE models). We used a 4th AMD EPYC CPU and an A100 GPU. We also report the FLOPs [15, 50] values, a metric for efficiency in learned sparse retrieval, which intuitively estimates the number of floating point operations between a query and a document in an inverted index. FLOPs can be computed as follows: 𝐹 𝐿𝑂𝑃𝑠 = E𝑞,𝑑 [ ∑︁ 𝑗 ∈𝑉 𝑝 (𝑞) 𝑗 𝑝 (𝑑 ) 𝑗 ] , (7) where 𝑝 (𝑞) 𝑗 and 𝑝 (𝑑 ) 𝑗 are the probabilities of activation of the 𝑗𝑡ℎ to- ken in the vocabulary, resp. in query and document representations, over which we average on the dataset distribution. 4.2 Baselines We compare our DiSCo model with a wide range of competitive methods, consisting of query rewriting, supervised fine-tuned, and distillation-based methods, which we list below. Table 2: One-shot prompt used for rewriting with the LLMs teachers. The example is taken out of the QReCC dataset. # Instruction: I will give you a conversation between a user and a system. You should rewrite the last question of the user into a self-contained query. # Example 1: # Context: user: Tell me about the benefit of Yoga? system: Increased flexibility, muscle strength. # Please rewrite the following user question: Does it help in reducing stress? # Re-written query: Does Yoga help in reducing stress? # Example 2: # Context: <ctx> # Please rewrite the following user question: <utterance> # Re-written query: Query rewriting methods. SPLADE-[T5/Llama/Mistral/Human]QR does retrieval using the SPLADE ad-hoc retrieval model trained on MS MARCO [ 47]. As input, we pass the rewritten query us- ing T5 [55], Llama 3.1 [13], Mistral [23], or gold human rewrites2. SPLADE no rewrite is the same ad-hoc retrieval model without rewrite, on the original conversation.IterCQR [21], CHIQ-Fusion [43], and LLM4CS [41] are state-of-the-art query rewriting baselines; however, they require multiple LLM calls at inference, which puts them under a high disadvantage. For LLM4CS, we reproduced their best setting (RAR, Mean aggregation from 𝑁 = 5, CoT, GPT-4). Supervised fine-tuned methods. convSPLADE [42] and convA- NCE [42] are two methods fine-tuned using the InfoNCE loss on the conversational contrastive labels. Their input is the whole con- versational context. We reproduce convSPLADE for out-of-domain retrieval using the same hyperparameters as in the original paper. Distillation-based method. LeCoRe [42], QRACDR [46] and Con- vDR [65]3 all learn to distill the gold human rewrite representations and usually combine the distillation loss with an InfoNCE. Like our DiSCo, these models do not rely on LLM calls either, making them comparable. ConvDR and QRACDR are both dense approaches, using latent representations, while LeCoRe uses learned sparse rep- resentations. All of them distill query representations, while DiSCo the similarity scores, as a relaxation of their distillation method. 4.3 Implementations details We use the SPLADE++ [16]4 checkpoints from Huggingface [60] for all our SPLADE models. To further finetune on the CS task, we fine-tune for 5 epochs, with a learning rate of2𝑒 −5, a max sequence length for queries of 64 tokens, and 100 tokens for answers, with 2We used the latest Llama meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Mistral mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 and T5 castorini/t5-base-canard 3We did not manage to reproduce the results reported in the original papers, as our reproduced results were much lower. Therefore, we report the numbers in the original papers. Therefore, we are not able to perform any significance tests with these models. 4naver/splade-cocondenser-ensembledistil [16] SIGIR ’25, July 13–18, 2025, Padua, Italy Simon Lupart, Mohammad Aliannejadi, and Evangelos Kanoulas Table 3: In-Domain Performance on TopiOCQA and QReCC.

We also use a 256-token limit for passages. We use a batch size of 10, with 16 negatives per query, and in-batch negatives [35]. Default experiments with SPLADE use FLOPS and L1 regularization, as in the original code, with values 𝜆𝑞 = 1𝑒 −3, 𝜆𝑑 = 5𝑒 −4. We use mixed precision and fp16 to maximize memory use. For sparse retrieval, we use inverted indexes based on the numba library and pyserini [33] together with Pytorch [51]. The fusion method uses the ranx library [5]. All teachers use In-Context learning to generate the rewrites. We provide the one-shot prompt used for rewriting with the LLM Teacher models in Table 2. We experimented in both zero-shot and one-shot, but decided to use one-shot to improve the quality of the teacher models. Given the high efficiency of our fine-tuning, we were able to run the experiments on a single A100 GPU with 40GB of GPU memory. 5 Results In this section, we present the results of our DiSCo and the proposed distillation for in-domain and out-of-domain retrieval, together with an analysis of the multi-teacher distillation and the efficiency- effectiveness trade-off. Research questions. We aim to answer the following questions: RQ1 Would relaxing the distillation training objective improve conversational sparse retrieval in-domain performances? RQ2 How would the relaxation affect the out-of-domain general- ization capacities of the models? RQ3 How does the distillation of multiple LLM teachers compare to single teacher distillation? RQ4 How does the relaxed distillation affect the efficiency and sparsity of the student models? 5.1 Performance Comparison In this first subsection, we aim to answerRQ1 and RQ2 by compar- ing the performance of our proposed DiSCo with state-of-the-art query rewriting, and distillation-based methods. We first compare the performance of DiSCo in the in-domain and out-of-domain retrieval setups in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. The tables report the performance of diverse baselines in terms of various metrics, as well as the number of LLM calls every model requires at inference. This is an important factor while comparing the performance of conver- sational retrieval models for various reasons, namely, (i) LLM call leads to considerable inference latency, delaying inferencing from hundreds of milliseconds to seconds; and (ii) LLM-based methods take advantage of the vast parameter size and knowledge learned by the training of the LLMs, making their comparison to other smaller models unfair. In-domain retrieval. Trying to address RQ1, we report in Table 3 in-domain performance on TopiOCQA and QReCC. Looking at the results, we do not observe a big gap between the rewriting and distillation-based methods, even though the rewriting-based methods make use of the LLM knowledge in the rewriting phase.

Besides, our DiSCo outperforms all rewriting- and distillation- based baselines with a large margin, showing that relaxing the distillation constraint to learn the similarity score, rather than the representations leads to further improvements. In particular, we see that DiSCo Mistral manages to outperform the learned sparse baseline, LeCoRe, by 10 and 2.8 points on TopiOCQA and QReCC resp. in terms of Recall@100. Out-of-domain retrieval. To further study the effectiveness of our proposed distillation approach, and study its generalizability, we report in Table 4 the results in the out-of-domain retrieval setting on TREC CAsT 20,22 and iKAT 23. Addressing RQ2, we see that, unlike the in-domain setting, there is a considerable gap between the rewriting-based and distillation-based methods when it comes to out-of-domain retrieval. On average, rewriting-based methods perform 19% better than distillation-based methods because they mainly rely on the massive parameter size and knowledge of LLMs, leading to high generalizability. However, as mentioned earlier mak- ing LLM calls on inference puts the models at a high disadvantage because of the high latency. Focusing on distillation-based approaches, our DiSCo outper- forms other methods by a large margin, showing the remarkable generalizability of our proposed relaxed distillation. In particular, we see that DiSCo Human outperforms QRACDR by 3.8 points in terms of nDCG@3, and LeCoRe by 5.5 points in terms of Recall@100, both on CAsT 2020. Note that those two models are two state-of-the- art models in the same zero-shot settings, trained on QReCC and evaluated on CAsT 2020. It is also noteworthy that even though our distillation-based approach is not able to outperform some of the rewriting-based (LLM-based) methods, our DiSCo-Fusion, which is a fusion method based on LLM rewriting and distillation manages to outperform all rewriting-based methods by a large margin in terms of Recall@100, reaching SotA conversational passage retrieval per- formance. When comparing closely with the SotA LLM4CS model, we note that while LLM4CS takes advantage of 5 GPT-4 calls, our DiSCo multi-teach model outperforms it in terms of recall on all out-of-domain datasets. Comparing the precision-oriented metrics, we see that DiSCo multi-teach outperforms LLM4CS on all datasets, except TREC CAsT 2020. This dataset was the second edition of TREC CAsT and is considered to be simpler than both 2022 and 2023 versions, showing the performance of our model on complex information needs. Also, considering that we focus on the retrieval task, we consider recall to be preferable, as reranking can be added post-retrieval on a smaller set of documents [11, 62]. Distillation-rewriting fusion. Furthermore, note in Table 4 that DiSCo-Fusion is the fusion of our DiSCo and SPLADE MistralQR, as the fusion of the student with the teacher. Although SPLADE MistralQR exhibits high performance (e.g., 0.57 and 0.33 in terms of Recall@100 resp. on CAsT 2020, 2022), fusing it with the distilled DiSCo leads to further significant improvements (4 points increase on both datasets). This indicates that relaxing the distillation pro- cess to the similarity score enables the model to go beyond the knowledge of the teacher in the representation space. This gain is even stronger on the precision of CAsT 2022, where DiSCo-Fusion outperforms SPLADE MistralQR by 8 points in terms of nDCG@3. Comparison with the teacher models. Now looking at the per- formance of the students and teachers models in Table 3, we see SIGIR ’25, July 13–18, 2025, Padua, Italy Simon Lupart, Mohammad Aliannejadi, and Evangelos Kanoulas SPLADE QR DiSCo 0.775 0.800 0.825 0.850 0.875 0.900 0.925 0.950Recall@100Llama (T1) Mistral (T2) Human (T3) T1 T1-T2 T1-T2-T3 T2-T3 T eachers Students with Multi-T eachers Figure 4: Teacher Selection on QReCC. (Left) SPLADE Teacher Models with different LLM QR. (Right) DiSCo Students when trained with multi-teachers. Best set in red ( 𝑇2 and 𝑇3). that the student models outperform the teachers significantly for in- domain retrieval. In particular, DiSCo Human outperforms SPLADE HumanQR by 3.5 MRR points on QReCC; and similarly with DiSCo Mistral. This demonstrates that our distillation objective allows the student model to learn representations that surpass the original teacher’s representations. This is possible thanks to the relaxation of the distillation, as the student can adapt and learn optimal repre- sentations based on gradient descent optimization. This was not possible with the previous distillation objective on the representa- tion, as student models were trained to copy the representations of the teacher model. Out-of-domain however, we see in Table 4 that the student models have more difficulties outperforming the perfor- mance of the teacher models. This result on out-of-domain retrieval is, however, not fair considering that teacher model generalization relies on billions of parameters, while students on a few hundred. Recall also that DiSCo-Fusion as the fusion of the teacher and the student was further improving performance out-of-domain. Reliance on weak teacher model. Finally, we explore the reliance on the teacher models, by training DiSCo with a weaker teacher model, such as T5. This is interesting in scenarios where we do not have access to strong teachers and also shows the robustness of the method when trained on more noisy labels. From Table 3, we see that DiSCo T5 performs almost on par with DiSCo Mistral, while SPLADE MistralQR outperforms SPLADE T5QR by an important margin, on both TopiOCQA and QReCC. Our method is thus robust even when trained on lower-quality rewrites from the teacher. 5.2 Multiple Teachers Distillation While the previous section focused on the distillation of single teachers, here we answer RQ3 on the use of multiple teachers. Thus, we compare our DiSCo model trained with multiple teachers. In-domain and out-of-domain retrieval. Trying to addressRQ3, both Tables 3 and 4 include our DiSCo multi-teach model trained with multiple teachers. Considering the performances of DiSCo multi-teach for in-domain retrieval, we observe significant gains compared to DiSCo Mistral on QReCC. In particular, we observe a 1-point increase in terms of R@10, MRR, and nDCG@3 on QReCC. This result remains consistent for out-of-domain retrieval, where within Table 4 DiSCo multi-teach outperforms its single version Table 5: Inference Efficiency on TREC CAsT 2020. Rewrite and query encoding are measured on GPU, while the inverted index search on CPU with the Numba library. DiSCo Fusion is the fusion of SPLADE MistralQR with DiSCo Mistral.

On iKAT 2023, however, we observe mixed results. Two interpretations are possible for these general gains: first, the multiple teachers and their subsequent rewrites produce word synonyms, as a form of query expansion, improving the performance, and second, as one LLM may fail to resolve the context modeling task, another can balance it, offering better robustness. Progressive Improvement. Further addressing RQ3, Figure 4 gives insights on the multiple teachers distillation. While the left part of the Figure gives the performances of the teachers on QReCC, the right part shows the gains when incrementally adding teachers to the distillation. We can also notice the important gains from the distillation of LlamaQR. In particular, DiSCo Llama improves by 8 points compared to SPLADE LlamaQR in terms of Recall@100, while in comparison DiSCo Mistral by only 4 points compared to his teacher. This shows that the relaxation is robust and can learn from even lower-quality rewrites. 5.3 Effectiveness-Efficiency Trade-off In this subsection, we aim to answer RQ4 by analyzing the effecti- veness-efficiency trade-off of the proposed DiSCo models. First, we measure the efficiency of our method compared to rewriting-based methods. Then, we show the possibility of controlling the sparsity of the model through the FLOP regularization. Finally, we dive into sparsity at different depths of conversations. Efficiency.As to explicit the inference efficiency gain of our method compared to rewrite-based approaches, we plot in Table 5 the ef- ficiency in milliseconds of the models on TREC CAsT 2020. We observe from the table that while SPLADE MistralQR achieves very high performance here out-of-domain, the efficiency is very low compared to DiSCo Mistral. This is because of the rewriting step, which involves 1 LLM call for MistralQR. Also note that the rewrite needs to be executed on GPU, while most of the retrieval time is a search through the inverted index on CPU. DiSCo Mis- tral and multi-teach thus appear to have a better trade-off when it comes to efficiency. Finally, DiSCo Fusion has the best performance overall, without an important computational overload compared DiSCo: LLM Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Sparse Retrieval in Conversational Search SIGIR ’25, July 13–18, 2025, Padua, Italy avgq_len37.0avgq_len22.7 Figure 5: Effectiveness-efficiency trade-off on TopiOCQA. Sparser representations have a lower latency but also a lower MRR. avg q_len is the average number of activated tokens in the conversation representations, as indicator of efficiency. to SPLADE MistralQR 5. Note that retrieval is not optimized, and libraries such as PISA could reduce retrieval of SPLADE models below 100 ms on CPU, as shown in recent papers [27, 30, 32]. This would further increase the efficiency gap between rewrite-based and distillation-based approaches. We also focus here on inference efficiency, as training efficiency does not directly affect the user, and would involve training LLMs. Those results provide a first answer to RQ4 on the efficiency of DiSCo compared to existing methods. Controlling Sparsity. We then focus here on the sparsity of the sparse representations, as a measure of efficiency within the in- verted index. Figure 5 plots the performance and FLOPs of several DiSCo models when trained with different levels of sparsity. This is possible thanks to the regularization loss from the SPLADE archi- tecture, controlled by the hyper-parameters (𝜆𝑞, 𝜆𝑑 ) [17]. From the Figure, we see for example that the same DiSCo T5 model can be trained with different degrees of regularization, leading to different FLOPs and MRR. Furthermore, Figure 5 shows the FLOPs of the as- sociated teacher models: SPLADE MistralQR and T5QR. We notice that our student DiSCo models are more sparse compared to their teachers, as having only a constraint on similarities during train- ing allows more freedom on the representations and their sparsity. This answers part of RQ4, showing that DiSCo can be trained with different sparsity levels. Sparsity at different Conversation Depths. To further address RQ4, we plot the sparsity and effectiveness of several baselines in Figure 6. On the left part of the graph, we see the performance according to the depth of the conversation – as the number of previous interactions between the user and the system – and on the right the number of activated tokens in the representations. In particular, we see the difficulty for long conversations across models. Comparing our DiSCo with the convSPLADE baseline, we see that the main improvement comes from longer conversations. 5DiSCo Fusion being an ensembling of two approaches, we report the maximum execution time of the two (as they could be executed in parallel). Figure 6: (Left) Performance with respect to depth on Topi- OCQA. (Right) Sparsity of query representations with respect to depth of conversations. We also see that DiSCo outperforms its teacher model, SPLADE MistralQR, on the first few turns of the conversation. This is also a difficult task here as the TopiOCQA dataset has topic switches every few turns, making the context modeling task more complex. Examining sparsity, we observe that the representations across all models remain sparse, with at most 60 non-zero dimensions even at deeper conversation levels ( > 10). At these depths, con- versations become significantly longer, reaching up to 350 tokens. This suggests that the models effectively perform noise reduction as part of the context modeling task, activating only a subset of the tokens from the context. Now, comparing the models, as SPLADE MistralQR relies on Mistral rewrite, we see that the representation sparsity is consistent even for long conversations. For DiSCo and convSPLADE, sparsity decreases with the turns of the conversation. 6 Conclusion & Future Work In this work, we propose DiSCo, a novel distillation strategy in CS to distill query rewriting from LLMs. DiSCo trains CS models with a relaxed distillation strategy that unifies context modeling and retrieval tasks. Our experiments on LSR and DiSCo models demon- strate that this training objective achieves important performance gains in both in-domain and out-of-domain retrieval. By distilling LLM rewrites, our method effectively learns from a single or several LLM teachers, outperforming the teachers, and reaching SoTA on several CS datasets. The proposed training strategy of DiSCo also shows robustness to the quality of the teacher model when trained on weaker teacher models. We further examine the inference effi- ciency and sparsity of our approach after distillation. Our findings emphasize the importance of aligning the rewriting and retrieval tasks in CS, with training objectives that unify both tasks. As a future work, we plan to study different teachers, as any model pro- ducing a similarity score could be distilled, e.g., cross-encoder [20], paired with stronger LLMs for rewrite.
