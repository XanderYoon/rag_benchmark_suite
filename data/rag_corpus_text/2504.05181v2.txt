Lightweight and Direct Document Relevance Optimization for Generative Information Retrieval Kidist Amde Mekonnen University of Amsterdam Amsterdam, The Netherlands k.a.mekonnen@uva.nl Yubao Tang University of Amsterdam Amsterdam, The Netherlands y.tang3@uva.nl Maarten de Rijke University of Amsterdam Amsterdam, The Netherlands m.derijke@uva.nl Abstract Generative information retrieval (GenIR) is a promising neural re- trieval paradigm that formulates document retrieval as a document identifier (docid) generation task, allowing for end-to-end optimiza- tion toward a unified global retrieval objective. However, existing GenIR models suffer from token-level misalignment, where models trained to predict the next token often fail to capture document-level relevance effectively. While reinforcement learning-based methods, such as reinforcement learning from relevance feedback ( RLRF), aim to address this misalignment through reward modeling, they introduce significant complexity, requiring the optimization of an auxiliary reward function followed by reinforcement fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and often unstable. To ad- dress these challenges, we propose direct document relevance opti- mization (DDRO), which aligns token-level docid generation with document-level relevance estimation through direct optimization via pairwise ranking, eliminating the need for explicit reward model- ing and reinforcement learning. Experimental results on benchmark datasets, including MS MARCO document and Natural Questions, show that DDRO outperforms reinforcement learning-based meth- ods, achieving a 7.4% improvement in MRR@10 for MS MARCO and a 19.9% improvement for Natural Questions. These findings high- light DDRO’s potential to enhance retrieval effectiveness with a simplified optimization approach. By framing alignment as a direct optimization problem, DDRO simplifies the ranking optimization pipeline of GenIR models while offering a viable alternative to reinforcement learning-based methods.

A new paradigm has re- cently been added to this palette, generative information retrieval (GenIR) [34, 60]. This approach uses pre-trained encoder-decoder models as differentiable search indexes (DSI). It has inspired the de- velopment of several models [4, 33, 43, 50, 52–55, 64, 70, 71, 79, 80] Generative information retrieval. GenIR models represent doc- uments as sequences of unique document identifiers (docids), gen- erated autoregressively, where each token is conditioned on the query encoding and previously generated tokens. The generation process is controlled through (constrained) beam search [ 33, 60, 64, 70, 71, 80]. Docids could be predefined and remain static dur- ing training, making their careful design crucial for optimal re- trieval performance [58]. We classify docids into two categories based on their generation methodology and abstraction level. The first category, referred to as content-derived docids, includes iden- tifiers that are extracted directly from document elements such as titles [12, 13, 16, 25, 51, 56, 57, 59], n-grams [4, 11, 28, 29, 65], URLs [43, 76, 79, 82], and key terms [ 75]. These docids preserve surface-level textual characteristics and are closely tied to the orig- inal document content. In contrast, the second category, termed computationally-generated are derived using techniques like quan- tization [10, 42, 70, 71, 79] or hierarchical clustering algorithms [33, 48, 60, 64] to encode deeper semantics by abstracting raw doc- ument content into conceptual features. During training, GenIR models learn to associate document text with corresponding docids, embedding semantic information di- rectly into its parameters. During retrieval, docids are sequentially generated based on learned representations. By unifying indexing and retrieval within a transformer-based architecture, these models optimize both processes simultaneously [34, 60]. Challenges in GenIR. Despite recent advancements, GenIR mod- els face key limitations that hinder their effectiveness. These models typically rely on an auto-regressive loss function that optimizes the generation of individual docid tokens. However, this token- level optimization approach does not align with the broader goal of ranking tasks, which requires assessing the overall relevance of a document to the query. As a result, this misalignment often leads to suboptimal ranking performance. To address these challenges, it is crucial to align token generation with document-level relevance estimation to ensure more accurate, well-rounded retrieval outcomes. arXiv:2504.05181v2 [cs.IR] 24 Apr 2025 SIGIR ’25, July 13–18, 2025, Padua, Italy Kidist Amde Mekonnen et al. Direct document-level relevance optimization. Existing ap- proaches aimed at aligning token-level docid generation with docu- ment-level relevance estimation, such as reinforcement learning from relevance feedback ( RLRF), use reinforcement learning to align predictions with relevance judgments through reward mod- eling [76]. However, RLRF introduces significant complexity, re- quiring the optimization of an auxiliary reward function followed by reinforcement fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and often unstable. To address these challenges, we introduce a direct document relevance optimization (DDRO) method that em- ploys a pairwise ranking approach into GenIR models to improve document retrieval performance. Our approach has two key phases. (i) First, we employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to train a language model (LM) capable of gen- erating docids that are most relevant to a given query. (ii) Next, we directly refine the model through pairwise ranking, where the model learns to differentiate between relevant and irrelevant do- cids for a specific query based on labeled data. This refinement ensures that the retrieval system ranks documents based on their relevance, aligning the model more closely with the query. The SFT phase serves as a pretraining step, aligning the model with initial relevance signals from training data and providing a strong foundation for the pairwise ranker to further fine-tune document ranking effectiveness. Experiments conducted on the MS MARCO document rank- ing [3] and Natural Questions (NQ) [23] benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of DDRO in improving retrieval accuracy, outper- forming multiple baselines. Moreover, DDRO maintains compet- itive performance with established baselines on broader metrics like R@10, demonstrating robustness across evaluation criteria. An ablation study further highlights the contributions of pairwise ranking optimization to the observed performance improvements. Main contributions. We introduce direct document relevance optimization (DDRO), a pairwise ranking approach that aligns do- cid generation with document-level relevance judgments. This ap- proach ensures that docids are generated not only based on token- level likelihood but also according to their relevance to the user’s query. DDRO unifies training objectives within a single framework, optimizing directly for document-level relevance. Experimental re- sults demonstrate improvements in retrieval accuracy, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed approach in enhancing generative retrieval models for relevance-based ranking. Reproducibility. To promote reproducibility in GenIR, we open- source our codebase and make checkpoints publicly available.1 2 Related Work Reward modeling. Recent efforts in GenIR have sought to bridge the gap between token-level optimization and document-level rele- vance. GenRRL [76] addresses this issue using RLRF to align docid generation with query relevance. While effective, this approach requires a robust reward model training and reinforcement learn- ing fine-tuning, both of which are resource-intensive and prone to instability. Developing a reliable reward model demands substan- tial labeled data, and reinforcement learning fine-tuning involves 1https://github.com/kidist-amde/DDRO-Direct-Document-Relevance-Optimization/ tree/main extensive hyperparameter tuning [40], contributing to training in- stability and scalability challenges for large-scale applications. In contrast, we proposeDDRO, a direct document-level relevance opti- mization method that eliminates the need for explicit reward model training and reinforcement learning fine-tuning, thereby reducing computational overhead and improving optimization efficiency. Dense-generative integration. Ranking-oriented generative re- trieval (ROGER) [77] combines dense and generative retrieval by using dense retrievers as intermediaries to provide relevance signals, bridging the gap between document ranking and docid generation. ROGER employs knowledge distillation from dense retrievers to enhance the generative model’s ranking capabilities, combining the strong relative ranking signals of dense retrieval with the flexibility of generative models. However, it relies on external dense retrievers and does not directly optimize for document-level relevance within the generative model’s training objectives. In contrast, DDRO elim- inates this dependency by incorporating pairwise ranking directly into the generative model’s optimization pipeline, ensuring align- ment with document-level relevance. Learning to rank in generative retrieval models. Similarly, LTRGR [29] incorporates a learning-to-rank (LTR) framework to address the gap between docid generation and document ranking. It introduces an additional training phase where the model is op- timized using a margin-based ranking loss, eliminating the need for a separate ranking step during inference. However, LTRGR focuses on optimizing passage ranking during the second phase, treating docid generation as a step toward this goal rather than fully integrating document-level relevance into the generative pro- cess. Consequently, the challenge of embedding document-level relevance directly into docid generation remains unaddressed. In contrast, DDRO integrates pairwise ranking directly into the gen- erative model’s optimization pipeline, ensuring docid generation inherently aligns with document-level relevance. Our approach. Building on the advancements of GenRRL, ROGER, and LTRGR, we propose a framework that combines SFT for do- cid generation with pairwise ranking optimization to better align GenIR objectives with ranking goals. DDRO addresses token-level misalignment by incorporating document-level relevance optimiza- tion into the training process, enhancing existing GenIR systems by enabling them to learn to rank more effectively. State-of-the-art baselines. SOTA baselines in GenIR, such as RIPOR [70] and PAG [ 71], employ multi-stage optimization ap- proaches. E.g., RIPOR refines relevance-based docids through itera- tive pre-training and fine-tuning, while PAG introduces a hybrid decoding strategy that combines simultaneous and sequential de- coding to enhance ranking efficiency. Both methods achieve strong results on the MS MARCO passage ranking dataset. Our work sim- plifies optimization with a single-framework approach, offering an alternative to multi-stage methods. A direct comparison with these baselines is deferred to future work to assess how DDRO can complement and extend these approaches while evaluating its scalability in large-scale retrieval tasks. Lightweight and Direct Document Relevance Optimization for Generative Information Retrieval SIGIR ’25, July 13–18, 2025, Padua, Italy 3 Preliminaries and Motivations 3.1 Generative Information Retrieval (GenIR) GenIR models build on large pre-trained language models, such as T5 [41] and BART [27], and are designed to take a query string and generate a ranked list of document identifiers (docids) based on their generation probabilities, ordered in descending sequence. Each document 𝑑 is assigned a unique identifier docid = (docid1, docid2, . . . ,docid𝐿), where 𝐿 is the length of the identifier, and the model processes the query 𝑞 to autoregressively generate the corresponding docid using a scoring function defined as: 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 (docid | 𝑞) = 𝐿Ö 𝑖=1 𝑝𝜃 (docid𝑖 | docid1:𝑖 −1, 𝑞), (1) where 𝑝𝜃 denotes the generative retrieval model parameterized by 𝜃, and docid𝑖 is the 𝑖-th token of the docid for document 𝑑. The generation continues until a special end-of-sequence (EOS) token is decoded. Training is performed using a multi-task setup that combines indexing and fine-tuning, which yields better results than training these tasks separately [60]. During indexing, the model memorizes the document collection and maps each document’s text to its corresponding docid. Fine-tuning then refines this mapping by optimizing query-to-docid associations. The model is optimized via the following loss 𝐿𝜃 𝐷𝑆𝐼 with teacher forcing [66]: ∑︁ 𝑑𝑖 ∈𝐷 log 𝑃 (𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑑 𝑖 | 𝑇 5𝜃 (𝑑𝑖 )) + ∑︁ 𝑞 𝑗 ∈𝑄 log 𝑃 (𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑑 𝑖 | 𝑇 5𝜃 (𝑞 𝑗 )), (2) where 𝐷 represents the document set, and 𝑄 denotes the query set. This loss function enables parameter updates during both indexing and fine-tuning, enhancing the model’s ability to generate the most relevant docid for a given query or document. The retrieval phase employs a (constrained) beam search algorithm to decode the most probable docid, with their generation probabilities determining the final ranking [33, 60, 64, 70, 71, 80]. 3.2 Learning to Rank (L2R) L2R aims at training models to rank documents based on their relevance to a given query [ 6, 9, 63]. L2R methods can be classi- fied into point-wise, pair-wise, and list-wise approaches based on their learning objectives. (i) Point-wise methods [19] frame ranking as a classification problem by scoring individual documents in- dependently: 𝐿point = Í 𝑖 L (ˆ𝑠 (𝑑𝑖, 𝑞), 𝑠(𝑑𝑖, 𝑞)), where ˆ𝑠 (𝑑𝑖, 𝑞) and 𝑠 (𝑑𝑖, 𝑞) denote the predicted relevance score and ground truth relevance score, respectively. In GenIR, generated probabilities serve as relevance scores, aligning with this approach [ 60]. And the retrieval term in Eq. 2 belongs to this type. (ii) Pair-wise ap- proaches [6, 9, 15, 63] compare document pairs to determine relative preferences: 𝐿pair = Í (𝑑𝑖,𝑑𝑗 ) log 1 + exp − ˆ𝑠 (𝑑𝑖, 𝑞) − ˆ𝑠 (𝑑 𝑗 , 𝑞) , where 𝑑𝑖 and 𝑑 𝑗 are used as pairs to compare. DDRO shares similari- ties with traditional pairwise L2R methods such as RankNet [5] and LambdaRank [7], in that it optimizes a margin between relevant and non-relevant documents. It differs in that the ranking signal is used to supervise the generation of structured docid sequences via a generative decoder. Unlike typical L2R approaches that score docu- ments retrieved by an external system, DDRO learns to produce do- cids directly, making it end-to-end generative. This integration of se- quence modeling and pairwise supervision is a key distinction from prior L2R pipelines. (iii) List-wise approaches [24, 67], optimize the entire ranked list:𝐿list = Í 𝑞 L (Softmax( ˆ𝑠 (𝑞, ˆ𝜋)), Softmax(𝑠 (𝑞, 𝜋))), where ˆ𝜋 and 𝜋 are the predicted and ground-truth lists, respectively. In GenIR, Tang et al. [53] introduces a position-aware list-level ob- jective to learn the relevance. As we focus on pair-wise approaches, comparisons with list-wise methods are left for future work. A fundamental challenge in GenIR stems from the inherent mis- alignment between the optimization objectives of autoregressive models and the overarching objectives of document ranking tasks. Training GenIR models solely to generate docids can be treat as the point-wise approach, which is often insufficient for achieving effective ranking. Addressing this challenge necessitates the de- velopment of a robust framework that enables GenIR models to directly learn to rank [29, 76, 77]. 3.3 Reinforcement Learning from Relevance Feedback (RLRF) To address the aforementioned limitations, Zhou et al. [76] propose GenRRL, a generative retrieval model based on RLRF to optimize generative models for alignment with document-level relevance. RLRF optimizes rewards while ensuring alignment with human preferences using a KL divergence constraint [2, 14, 30, 35, 39, 47, 76]. This method refines model predictions using a learned reward function, as formalized in prior research [20, 21]: max𝜋𝜃 E𝑥∼D ,𝑦∼𝜋𝜃 (𝑦 |𝑥 )  𝑟𝜙 (𝑥, 𝑦)  − 𝛽DKL  𝜋𝜃 (𝑦|𝑥) ∥𝜋ref(𝑦|𝑥)  , (3) where 𝛽 is a parameter controlling deviation from the base refer- ence policy 𝜋ref, which is typically the initial supervised fine-tuned model. This constraint prevents the model from straying too far from the data distribution used to train the reward function, pre- serving output diversity and avoiding overfitting to high-reward responses. Since language generation is non-differentiable, rein- forcement learning (RL) techniques are widely used. A widely rec- ognized approach [39, 47, 81] optimizes the reward function using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [46], and defines the reward function as: 𝑟 (𝑥, 𝑦) = 𝑟𝜙 (𝑥, 𝑦) − 𝛽 (log 𝜋𝜃 (𝑦|𝑥) − log 𝜋ref(𝑦|𝑥)) . (4) GenRRL [76] trains a reward model using relevance-annotated data derived from BM25 [44], DPR [22], and LLaMA-13b [61]. This re- ward model guides reinforcement learning to optimize the language model’s policy for generating high-reward outputs, with a KL diver- gence constraint ensuring alignment with the original supervised fine-tuned model or the reference policy𝜋ref. The optimization pro- cess involves supervised fine-tuning using negative log-likelihood, pairwise ranking loss for the reward model, and reinforcement learning techniques incorporating pointwise, pairwise, and list- wise approaches to enhance ranking performance. While effective, this approach introduces considerable complexity, requiring the training of multiple models and sampling from the policy during training, which substantially increases computational costs.

Inspired by the work of Rafailov et al. [40], we propose direct doc- ument relevance optimization (DDRO), a streamlined approach de- signed to enhance the ranking capabilities ofGenIR models. DDRO directly optimizes GenIR models to learn document-level rank- ing without relying on explicit reward modeling or reinforcement learning. While our optimization is inspired by the DPO frame- work [40], its adaptation to GenIR is non-trivial. Unlike preference alignment for open-ended generation, our task involves optimizing structured docid generation under beam decoding constraints. Ad- ditionally, our method differs in both architecture (encoder-decoder vs. decoder-only) and objective (document ranking vs. preference alignment), requiring novel integration into GenIR pipelines. To the best of our knowledge, DDRO is the first method to apply preference-style optimization directly to generative document re- trieval by extending DPO-style training to constrained generative settings, leveraging pairwise query-docid relevance supervision and constrained decoding. 4 Method We provide a comprehensive explanation of the proposedDDRO method. As depicted in Figure (1), the method initiates with the gen- eration of two categories of docids, designed to encapsulate diverse semantic and contextual features of the documents (Section 4.1). Subsequently, the retrieval model is trained through a combination of self-supervised and supervised learning techniques (Section 4.2). Finally, direct learning-to-rank (L2R) optimization is applied, using relevance feedback to refine the model’s ranking quality and align its outputs with document-level relevance (Section 4.3). 4.1 Docid Construction The methodology for constructing docids in this work is grounded in established frameworks [ 70, 71, 76, 79]. This approach uses keyword-based identifiers to effectively encapsulate the seman- tic and contextual information of the documents. URL and Title (TU). Titles in web search results are typically crafted to be descriptive, closely aligning with user search intent, while URLs often contain structured tokens, such as keywords or domains, that are highly indicative of relevance for web-based queries [79]. The structure of the URL reverses to prioritize seman- tically meaningful segments. When a URL lacks descriptive content (e.g., uses numeric IDs or generic paths), we fall back to a combi- nation of the document’s title and domain name as an alternative identifier. Formally, this docid variant is defined as: 𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑑 TU = ( reverse(URL), if the URL is semantically rich, title + domain, otherwise. (5) Product quantization codes (PQ). Building on prior work [10, 42, 70, 79], we adopt product quantization (PQ) to reduce the di- mensionality of document representations while maintaining their semantic integrity. PQ compresses document vectors into latent semantic tokens by employing K-means clustering to partition the latent vector space into clusters. Each document is then represented by the corresponding cluster center, forming a compact identifier that preserves the document’s core semantic features. The resulting docid is defined as: 𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑑 𝑃𝑄 = 𝑃𝑄 (Encoder(𝑑)), (6) where the encoder is based on a pre-trained T5 model [36]. The clus- tering process generates 𝒌 cluster centers across 𝒏 groups, expand- ing the vocabulary by 𝒏 × 𝒌 new tokens. This approach produces a semantically rich and efficient representation of each document. 4.2 Supervised Fine-tuning Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) enhances the retrieval capabilities of pre-trained language models by aligning them with task-specific data [1, 39, 47]. Based on the two basic operations of DSI [60], i.e., indexing and retrieval tasks, diverse data pairs are curated and optimized using a teacher forcing policy [66] to achieve alignment with the ground truth. Indexing task. To memorize the corpus, the indexing task learns associations between documents and docids, making the document input format a crucial factor. Inspired by the indexing strategy pro- posed in [79], we generate self-supervised learning signals directly from the document corpus.

Text segments are mapped to their corresponding docids, en- abling the model to link document passages with their broader context [8, 79]. Each document is divided into fixed-size passages, paired with the document’s docid to create passage-to-docid pairs. For a document containing 𝑁 terms, {𝑤 1, 𝑤2, . . . , 𝑤𝑁 }, multiple passage-to-docid pairs are generated as follows: passage : {𝑤𝑖, 𝑤𝑖+1, . . . , 𝑤𝑖+𝑚−1} → 𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑑, (7) where 𝑖 is the starting term of a passage, and 𝑚 is the fixed passage length. To emphasize a document’s core semantic content, terms are prioritized by their 𝑡 𝑓 -𝑖𝑑 𝑓 scores [44], with a subset of high- scoring terms selected to form a compressed representation, which is then mapped to the document’s docid: terms : {𝑤 𝑎, 𝑤𝑏, 𝑤𝑐 } → 𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑑, (8) where 𝑤 𝑎, 𝑤𝑏, 𝑤𝑐 are key terms selected based on their 𝑡 𝑓 -𝑖𝑑 𝑓 scores. Retrieval task. During retrieval, a pre-trained language model is fine-tuned with supervised query-docid pairs to learn seman- tic mappings between queries and their corresponding docids. A key challenge in this process is the scarcity of labeled click data, which limits the ability to establish effective query-to-docid asso- ciations. To mitigate this, pseudo-queries are generated directly from the document corpus [ 64, 80]. Specifically, the docTTTTT- query [38] model is fine-tuned using supervised click data from the MS MARCO document and NQ datasets. For each document, an initial passage serves as input, and the model produces 𝑘 predicted queries using beam search, denoted as 𝑄 = {𝑞1, . . . , 𝑞𝑘 }. These diverse datasets, including passage-to-docid pairs, super- vised query-docid pairs (derived from real-world relevance judg- ments), and synthetic pseudo-queries, are collectively used to train the 𝝅ref 𝜃 model. Using these comprehensive and diverse training data, the SFT model acquires a robust understanding of query- to-document mappings and learns to generate relevant docids by optimizing token-level generation probabilities for a given query. Training objective. The model is trained with a sequence-to- sequence objective, aiming to maximize the likelihood of the target sequence through teacher forcing [66]. Given an input sequence 𝑠, which can be any of the document formats or queries described above, the objective is defined as: 𝐿𝜃 SFT = arg max 𝜃 log 𝑃 (𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑑 ∗ | 𝑠, 𝜋 ref 𝜃 (𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑑 )), (9) where 𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑑 ∗ represents the ground truth sequence, 𝜋ref 𝜃 (𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑑 ) denotes the sequence generated by the SFT model, and 𝑃 (𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑑 ∗ | 𝑠, 𝜋 ref 𝜃 (𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑑 )) corresponds to the conditional probability of the ground truth given the input sequence and the model’s generated sequence. 4.3 Direct L2R Optimization Using Relevance Feedback DDRO simplifies the complexities associated with reward modeling and reinforcement learning used in RLRF approaches. Instead, it directly optimizes the likelihood that relevant docids (𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑑 +) are assigned higher scores over non-relevant ones (𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑑 −) for a given query, as illustrated in Figure (3). The corresponding optimization objective is formulated as: LDDRO (𝜋𝜃 ; 𝜋ref) = − E(𝑞,𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑑 +,𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑑 − )∼𝐷  log 𝜎  𝛽 log 𝜋𝜃 (𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑑 + | 𝑞) 𝜋ref(𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑑 + | 𝑞) − 𝛽 log 𝜋𝜃 (𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑑 − | 𝑞) 𝜋ref(𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑑 − | 𝑞)  , (10) where 𝜋𝜃 (𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑑 |𝑞) is the policy that is being optimized, while 𝜋ref(𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑑 |𝑞) is the reference policy, typically the fine-tuned model (SFT). This formulation ensures that the optimized model remains close to the reference policy while improving relevance-based rank- ing. The DDRO update guides the model toward producing outputs better aligned with relevance by utilizing pairwise comparisons, of- fering a simplified alternative to RL-based approaches. The gradient w.r.t. the model parameters𝜃 is defined as in Eq. 7, where ˆ𝑟𝜃 (𝑞, 𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑑 ) = 𝛽 log 𝜋𝜃 (𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑑 | 𝑞) 𝜋ref(𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑑 | 𝑞) (11) is the reward implicitly defined by the model 𝜋𝜃 and the reference model 𝜋ref. The examples are weighted according to how much the implicit reward model ˆ𝑟𝜃 overestimates the ranking of the non- relevant docid compared to the relevant docid. This weighting is scaled by 𝛽, reflecting the degree of misjudgment while considering the strength of the KL divergence constraint. The sigmoid function 𝜎 (·) ensures smooth optimization, and the model parameters 𝜃 are adjusted to increase the likelihood of the relevant docids over non-relevant ones. This reparameterization streamlines the train- ing process by eliminating the need for an explicit reward model and iterative fine-tuning, providing a more stable and efficient framework for aligning the retrieval model with document-level relevance objectives. 5 Experimental Settings 5.1 Datasets and Evaluation Metrics Datasets. We conduct our experiments using two widely recog- nized benchmarks: the MS MARCO Document Ranking dataset2 [3] and theNatural Questions (NQ)dataset3 [23]. The MS MARCO document ranking dataset is widely used for document ranking tasks and contains a large collection of queries and web pages. Fol- lowing prior work [65, 76, 78, 79], we use a subset with 320k docu- ments and 360k query-document pairs for training. The NQ dataset, 2https://microsoft.github.io/msmarco/Datasets.html#document-ranking-dataset 3https://ai.google.com/research/NaturalQuestions/download SIGIR ’25, July 13–18, 2025, Padua, Italy Kidist Amde Mekonnen et al. Figure 3: Architecture of the DDRO model, which fine-tunes the retrieval model through direct learning-to-rank (L2R) optimization using relevance feedback.

For clarity, the model 𝜋 ref 𝜃 from the SFT phase is referred to as 𝜋 ref , with its param- eters frozen during this phase. introduced by Google, is a widely used benchmark in question- answering research. In this study, we use the NQ320k version, which includes 320k query-document pairs sourced from Wikipedia, with queries formulated in natural language. To ensure reliable evalua- tion and improve performance [26], we deduplicate documents by title and utilize the predefined training and validation splits. Evaluation metrics. Following [65, 76–79], we assess model per- formance using standard document retrieval metrics: Recall (R@1/5/ 10) and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR@10). Statistical significance is determined using paired t-tests with a threshold of 𝑝 < 0.05. 5.2 Baselines We evaluate our approach against three types of baseline: term- based retrieval, dense retrieval, and generative retrieval. Term-based retrieval. (i) BM25 [45], a probabilistic retrieval model commonly used as a standard baseline, implemented us- ing Pyserini.4 (ii) DocT5Query [38], which generates synthetic queries from documents using the T5 model [41], appending them to the original document text. Dense retrieval. (i) DPR [22], which utilizes a BERT-based dual encoder to produce dense embeddings for queries and documents. PseudoQ [49] improves DPR by generating pseudo-queries using K-means clustering over document embeddings. (ii) ANCE [68], a RoBERTa-based dual encoder that incorporates hard negatives retrieved from an asynchronously updated approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) index. (iii) RepBERT [74], a BERT-based model that generates fixed-length contextualized embeddings, with query– document relevance computed via inner product similarity. (iv)Sen- tence-T5 [36], which applies a T5-based architecture to gener- ate sentence embeddings using encoder-only and encoder-decoder models with contrastive learning. Generative retrieval. (i) DSI [60], which represents docids us- ing hierarchical k-means cluster IDs and trains with the DSI-Num objective. (ii) DSI-QG [80], which augments training data with synthetic queries generated using a query generation model [38] 4https://github.com/castorini/pyserini and represents documents with arbitrary unique numerical docids. (iii) NCI [64], which assigns semantically structured numeric do- cids paired with pseudo-queries. (iv) SEAL [16], which retrieves docids represented as arbitrary n-grams extracted from document text using an FM-index. (v) Ultron [79], which employs keyword and semantic-based docids, using a three-stage training approach: general pre-training, search-oriented pre-training, and supervised fine-tuning. (vi) ROGER [77], which transfers document relevance knowledge from a dense retriever to a generative retriever via knowledge distillation. (vii) MINDER [28], which assigns multi- ple identifiers, including titles, n-grams, and synthetic queries, to documents and pairs them for indexing. (viii) LTRGR [29], which trains on pairwise relevance objectives using margin-based rank- ing loss for optimization. (ix) GenRRL [76], which incorporates pointwise, pairwise, and listwise relevance optimization through reinforcement learning, using document summaries and URLs as docids. We exclude document summaries as docids due to their de- pendence on external summarization models, such as LLaMA-13b used in GenRRL. These models introduce preprocessing overhead and variability in identifier quality. Instead, DDRO employs product quantization (PQ) to generate compact, structured docids, ensuring consistency and scalability. Note on result sourcing. Baseline results for methods such as GenRRL [76] and ROGER [77] are taken from their original papers due to the unavailability of public code, ensuring consistency and avoiding potential reproducibility issues. Other results were repro- duced using publicly available code and the dataset configurations described in this work. 5.3 Implementation Details SFT. The SFT model is based on the T5-base pretrained model [41], trained with a learning rate of 1e-3 and a batch size of 128. All experiments involving various docid types were conducted on 8 NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPUs. Pseudo queries. The DocT5Query model [38], fine-tuned on the target dataset with document-query pairs, was used to generate 10 pseudo-queries per document. Contrastive data pair construction. Training triples were gener- ated using stratified sampling for diversity. Positive samples were selected based on qrels relevance judgments, while negatives were drawn from the top 1000 BM25-retrieved documents, stratified into top (1–100), mid (101–500), and lower (501–1000) ranks. Negatives were randomly sampled in roughly equal proportions, with 8 per query for NQ and 16 for MS MARCO. DDRO. The DDRO model was initialized with the pre-trained au- toregressive SFT model (see Section 4.2) and fine-tuned using the proposed direct learning-to-rank framework (see Section 4.3). Train- ing was performed using a modified Hugging Face TRLDPOTrainer [62], adapted for encoder-decoder models. A cosine learning rate scheduler with 1000 warm-up steps and early stopping was applied. The learning rate was set to 5e-6 for PQ-based docids and 1e-5 for URL-based docids, with a batch size of 64 and a regularization parameter 𝛽 of 0.4 to balance chosen and rejected responses. All experiments were conducted on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU.

During inference, constrained beam search generates valid docids by using a prefix tree [60] to enforce valid token sequences. 6 Experimental Evaluation and Results Our evaluation of DDRO focuses on the following questions: RQ1 How does DDRO compare to RLRF-based methods, such as GenRRL, in terms of retrieval performance while avoiding the complexities of reward modeling and reinforcement learning? RQ2 How does DDRO perform relative to established baselines in terms of retrieval accuracy and ranking consistency on benchmark datasets? RQ3 What is the impact of pairwise ranking optimization on the performance of DDRO? RQ4 How robust is DDRO across datasets with varying character- istics? RQ5 How does DDRO balance relevance across the ranked list in generative retrieval models, and what impact does it have on overall ranking quality? 6.1 Comparison with Reinforcement Learning-Based Methods To address RQ1, we compare DDRO with GenRRL [76] on both datasets. Results are presented in Table 1 and Table 2. We observe the following: (i) On MS MARCO,DDRO (TU) achieves the highest scores in early precision-focused metrics. Specifically, it outperforms GenRRL(Sum) by 15.06% in R@1 and 7.4% in MRR@10, highlighting its effectiveness in ranking the most relevant docu- ment at the top. While GenRRL (Sum) performs better in the R@10 metric, DDRO (TU) achieves comparable results with a simplified optimization process, avoiding the need for a reward model and re- inforcement learning. (ii) On NQ,DDRO (PQ) outperforms GenRRL (Sum) by 34.69% in R@1 and 19.87% in MRR@10, further validat- ing its effectiveness in retrieving relevant documents within the top ranks. GenRRL variants achieve higher R@10 scores, likely benefiting from multi-signal learning and listwise optimization strategies, potentially improving broader document retrieval. Sum- mary-based docids may aid performance on knowledge-intensive queries. (iii) DDRO (TU) and DDRO (PQ) show different trends across datasets: TU performs better on MS300K, while PQ excels on NQ. This disparity likely stems from higher document quality in NQ, where the rich semantic content allows the generated PQs to convey more meaningful information. In contrast, MS300K, which is derived from web search logs, contains noisy content such as ads, Table 2: Performance comparison of GenRRL and DDRO on the NQ320K dataset. The best results are in bold. Results for cited models are sourced from their original papers. Abbre- viations: PQ – Product Quantization; TU – Title + URL; Sum – document summary. Model R@1 R@5 R@10 MRR@10 GenRRL (TU) [76] 35.79 56.49 70.96 45.73 GenRRL (Sum) [76] 36.32 57.42 71.49 46.31 DDRO (TU) 40.86 53.12 55.98 45.99 DDRO (PQ) 48.92 64.10 67.31 55.51 resulting in lower-quality PQs. Consequently, TU, which prioritizes keyword-based features, effectively captures the core content of MS300K, where the shorter, keyword-focused queries align well with surface-level signals such as titles and URLs. 6.2 Comparison with Established Baselines To address RQ2, Table 3 presents a comprehensive comparison of DDRO with baselines on the MS300K dataset. We can observe the followings: (i) The performance of dense retrieval baselines is gen- erally better than that of sparse retrieval baselines, likely because the former uses dense vectors to capture richer semantic infor- mation, which is consistent with earlier findings [31, 32]. (ii) The best-performing dense retrieval baseline, ANCE, outperforms oth- ers such as SEAL, NCI, and DSI-QG. This could be due to the fact that these generative retrieval baselines rely solely on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to learn relevance, which may not fully capture the relevance patterns. However, ANCE lags behind mod- els like Ultron, ROGER, and LTGR, which employ more advanced optimization strategies. This highlights the need for fine-grained relevance modeling to enhance generative retrieval ranking perfor- mance. (iii) Our proposed DDRO (TU) outperforms these generative retrieval baselines, achieving 15.63% and 8.03% higher R@1 and MRR@10, respectively, compared to the best-performing baseline, ROGER-Ultron. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our document-level relevance optimization approach. While ROGER-Ul- tron achieves the highest R@10, DDRO (TU) delivers comparable performance within a more efficient and lightweight framework. 6.3 Ablation Study To address RQ3, an ablation study was conducted to assess the im- pact of pairwise ranking optimization onDDRO performance. From Table 4, we can find: (i) On the MS MARCO dataset, removing pair- wise ranking optimization significantly reduces intermediate and broader recall metrics (R@5 and R@10) for both DDRO variants, highlighting its critical role in improving retrieval performance. (ii) On the NQ dataset, excluding pairwise ranking optimization leads to consistent declines across all metrics, with a more pro- nounced impact on DDRO (PQ), particularly in early precision and broader recall. This underscores the importance of pairwise ranking in enhancing retrieval effectiveness at various ranking depths. These findings confirm that pairwise ranking optimization ef- fectively aligns model predictions with document relevance, con- tributing to improved performance across different ranking levels.

Figure 4 shows results for different 𝛽 values on MS MARCO and Natural Questions (NQ). A moderate setting (𝛽 = 0.4) consistently yields the best MRR@10 across both datasets. Smaller values (e.g., 𝛽 = 0.2) lead to under-regularization, resulting in unstable and suboptimal learning. In contrast, larger values (e.g., 𝛽 = 0.6) impose excessive regularization, restricting the model’s ability to adapt, and thus degrading performance. These results highlight the sensitivity of DDRO to the KL constraint, suggest- ing the importance of tuning 𝛽 to balance learning flexibility and regularization. 6.4 Robustness Analysis Across Datasets To address RQ4, additional experiments were conducted NQ dataset to evaluate the robustness of DDRO across datasets with varying characteristics. The analysis focuses on two aspects: (i) comparing DDRO retrieval performance with baseline models across different categories Table 5, and (ii) examining the impact of various docid design choices on retrieval effectiveness. Comparison to baseline retrieval models.

(ii) Dense retrieval baselines, including DPR and ANCE, improve early ranking metrics over term-based methods. (iii) Generative retrieval baselines, such as ROGER-Ultron (TU) and LTRGR, perform well across all metrics. The proposed DDRO achieves the highest overall performance. Specifically, DDRO (PQ) surpasses the best-performing baseline, ROGER-Ultron (TU), by 36.27% in R@1 and 23.58% in MRR@10. Impact of Dataset Characteristics and Docid Selection. The docid design is a critical factor influencing performance in GenIR, we further analyze the differences in performance among various de- signs within our proposedDDRO. Our analysis underscores the crit- ical impact of docid design on retrieval performance across datasets.

In contrast,DDRO (PQ) performs better on NQ, which features longer, complex queries requiring deeper semantic understanding. PQ-based docids effec- tively capture latent relationships, making them well-suited for NQ’s informational queries. These findings suggest that aligning docid strategies with dataset-specific characteristics enhances re- trieval effectiveness and model adaptability. 6.5 Analysis of Relevance Distribution The relevance distribution could, to some extent, reflect the re- trieval model’s ability to recognize relevance. Therefore, we analyze the retrieval performance of DDRO at different top positions in the generated docid list to address RQ5. We have the following observations: (i) Tables (3) and (5) demonstrate DDRO’s effective- ness across datasets, showcasing its adaptability. On MS MARCO, DDRO (TU) achieves the highest early precision, with statistically significant improvements in R@1 and MRR@10, and excels in inter- mediate ranking (R@5), outperforming models like ROGER-Ultron (TU) and LTRGR (SI). This highlights its ability to identify relevant documents early while maintaining strong intermediate perfor- mance. However, at broader recall levels (R@10), ROGER-Ultron (TU) shows a slight advantage over DDRO (TU). (ii) On NQ, DDRO (PQ) achieves the highest early precision (R@1, R@5), effectively ranking relevant documents for complex queries. The PQ-based docids capture deeper semantic relationships, leading to strong intermediate performance and competitive broader recall (R@10) against hybrid models such as ROGER-NCI (SI). Overall, DDRO consistently achieves strong performance with- out relying on auxiliary reward models, reinforcement learning, or dense retrieval signals. Instead, it employs SFT followed by pair- wise ranking optimization to refine early-stage precision while maintaining effectiveness across different ranking depths. 7 Conclusion We introduced DDRO, a novel approach for enhancing GenIR sys- tems by directly aligning docid generation with document-level relevance estimation. This alignment allows GenIR systems to ef- fectively learn to rank and improve accuracy. We experimented with two types of docid designs and designed a lightweight direct L2R optimization algorithm on top of SFT training. Unlike existing RL-based methods, DDRO simplifies optimization through pairwise ranking, eliminating the need for auxiliary reward modeling and RL fine-tuning. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DDRO offers a lightweight optimization process while achieving high performance and demonstrating robustness. However, DDRO has limitations that offer opportunities for further improvement. (i) Our evaluation has primarily focused on a subset of the MS MARCO document dataset, leaving its scalability to larger and more diverse corpora, including domain-specific and multilin- gual datasets, yet to be explored. Addressing this limitation will be crucial to assess DDRO’s adaptability in broader applications. (ii) Our current pairwise ranking formulation relies on binary rele- vance judgments (relevant vs. non-relevant), which may limit its expressiveness for queries with nuanced or graded relevance levels. Future work may explore listwise ranking objectives and graded relevance supervision to more accurately capture complex retrieval intents. (iii) Potential improvements could include advanced hard negative mining to enhance relevance discrimination and multi-ob- jective optimization to balance relevance with efficiency, fairness, and diversity. (iv) A comprehensive comparison with scalableGenIR baselines such as RIPOR and PAG remains an avenue for future research to assess DDRO’s scalability and integration potential in large-scale retrieval scenarios.
